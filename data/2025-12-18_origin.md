Abstract: This work investigated the effects of aging heat treatments on the microstructure and, consequently, the quasi-static (tensile properties) and dynamic (impact toughness) mechanical behaviour of a 17-4 PH stainless steel produced by powder bed fusion laser beam (PBF-LB). Multiscale microstructural characterization, using X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction, was conducted to establish quantitative correlations between microstructural evolution and mechanical performance, providing insight into the mechanisms governing plasticity and fracture. The PBF-LB specimens exhibited tensile strengths comparable to or exceeding those of conventionally manufactured counterparts but consistently showed significantly lower impact toughness, regardless of heat treatment conditions. Within the complex microstructure, strain-induced transformation of reversed austenite was found to enhance ductility and impact toughness. SiO2 inclusions, originating from the starting powder, were identified as nucleation sites for micro-cavities and proved detrimental to impact toughness. Meanwhile, the distribution of Cu-rich nanoprecipitates could be tailored to favour either tensile strength through Orowan strengthening or impact toughness by enhancing local plasticity, but not both simultaneously. This work highlights the pronounced strength-toughness trade-off inherent in PBF-LB-produced 17-4 PH alloys and reveals the interplay between strength, ductility, and toughness. These findings underscore the need for further research into dynamic loading mechanical properties, especially for demanding applications such as those in the nuclear sector.

Abstract: A simple theoretical model is developed to describe spin reorientation (SR) transitions in rare-earth orthoferrites and orthochromites RFeO3 and RCrO3. Within a ``single-doublet'' approach, the free energy includes anisotropy contributions from the 3d-sublattice and the splitting of the lower doublet of 4f-ions. The model predicts various types of SR transitions - first-order, second-order, and mixed - depending on anisotropy parameters. Effects of non-magnetic dilution, heat capacity anomalies, and behavior of the rare-earth magnetic moment in the SR region are analyzed.

Abstract: First-principles density functional simulations were employed to investigate the geometries, electrical properties, and hyperfine structures of various beryllium-doped diamond configurations, including interstitial (Be$_i$), substitutional (Be$_s$), and beryllium-nitrogen (Be-N) complexes. The incorporation of Be into the diamond lattice is more favorable as a substitutional dopant than as an interstitial dopant, although both processes are endothermic. Interstitial Be could potentially exhibit motional averaging from planar to axial symmetry with an activation energy of 0.1 eV. The most stable Be$_s$ configuration has $T_{d}$ symmetry with a spin state of $S=1$. Co-doping with nitrogen reduces the formation energy of Be$_s$-N$_{n}$ $(n=1-4)$ complexes, which further decreases as the number of nitrogen atoms increases. This is attributed to the smaller covalent radius of nitrogen compared to carbon, resulting in reduced lattice distortion. Be$_s$-N$_3$ and Be$_s$-N$_4$ co-doping introduces shallow donors, while Be$_s$ exhibits $n$-type semiconductivity, but the deep donor level renders it impractical for room-temperature applications. These findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of beryllium as a dopant in diamond and highlight the potential of beryllium-nitrogen co-doping for achieving $n$-type diamond semiconductors.

Abstract: The present study examines the electronic transport characteristics of amorphous semiconductors through TOF measurements and numerical simulations. The primary objective is to determine the DOS in amorphous selenium (a-Se) and to assess the temperature and electric field dependence of the hole mobility. A comprehensive investigation of localized states within the mobility gap is performed using Laplace transform analysis of ToF photocurrent transients, combined with the multiple trapping model. This approach enables accurate reconstruction of the DOS across a wide temperature range, allowing clear identification of shallow and deep trap levels and revealing thermally activated transport mechanisms. Simulated ToF currents are also used to evaluate the hole drift mobility under various thermal and field conditions. Activation energies are extracted from Arrhenius plots of the mobility data. The results support a physically consistent description of the electronic structure in a-Se and validate the applicability of Laplace-based techniques for probing charge transport in disordered semiconductors.

Abstract: The present theoretical study focuses on the structural, electronic and thermoelectric properties of PbTe, PbSe and their ternary alloys PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$, using the density functional theory (DFT) by the full potential linearised augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method implemented in Wien2k code. Structural properties were performed by using the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew Burke and Ernzenhof (GGA-PBE) scheme. The results show that the calculated lattice parameters are in good agreement with theoretical data previously obtained. For electronic properties, we noticed that for all the compounds of PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$, we have a direct band gap in L point. For thermoelectric properties, we used BoltzTraP2 code and Gibbs2 code. Our results show that the PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ compounds have reached a value of 2.55 for the figure of merit, which indicates that our material is a good thermoelectric candidate.

Abstract: Decisive experimental confirmation of the $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid phase in quantum spin ice remains an outstanding challenge. In this work, we propose stray-field magnetometry as a direct probe of the emergent photons -- the gapless excitation of the emergent electrodynamics in quantum spin ice. The emergent photons are transverse magnetization waves, which, in a finite sample, form discrete modes governed by one of two sets of natural boundary conditions: ``insulating'' or ``superconducting''. Considering cavity and thin film geometries, we find that the spectrum and spatial structure of the stray magnetic noise provide a sharp qualitative signature of the underlying electrodynamics. The predicted stray-field noise power lies comfortably within the detection range of present-day solid-state defect magnetometry.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) metallic lattices with kagome topology provide a unique platform for exploring the interplay between geometric frustration, reduced coordination, and lattice stability in elemental systems. Motivated by the recent experimental realization of atomically thin gold layers and kagome goldene, we present a first-principles investigation of free-standing kagome monolayers of Cu, Ag, and Au. Using density functional theory combined with lattice dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics, we systematically assess their structural, mechanical, dynamical, and thermal stability. All kagome monolayers satisfy the 2D Born criteria and exhibit relatively low in-plane stiffness compared to graphene and hexagonal goldene, reflecting the porous nature of the kagome lattice and its metallic bonding. Among the three systems, the Au-based lattice displays the highest in-plane Young's modulus. Phonon calculations reveal that the unstrained kagome phase is dynamically unstable for all metals. However, a moderate biaxial tensile strain of 5% stabilizes the Ag and Au monolayers, while Cu retains residual unstable modes. Finite-temperature simulations further show that Cu rapidly reconstructs toward a trigonal lattice, Ag remains metastable at low temperature but collapses at room temperature, and Au exhibits competing kagome and trigonal motifs at 300 K, indicating near-degeneracy between these phases. These results establish that strain engineering and atomic size are key determinants of the stability of metallic kagome monolayers and provide guidance for future substrate-supported realizations.

arXiv:2512.14867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zitterbewegung phenomenon in multiband electronic systems is known to be subtly related to the charge conductivity, Berry curvature and the Chern number. Here we show that some spin-dependent properties as the optical spin conductivity, and intrinsic spin Hall conductivity are also entangled with the Zitterbewegung amplitudes. We also show that in multiband Dirac-type Hamiltonians, a direct link between the Zitterbewegung and the spin textures and spin transition amplitudes can be established. The later allow us to discern the presence or not of the Zitterbewegung oscillations by simply analyzing the spin or pseudo-spin textures. We provide examples of the applicability of our approach for Hamiltonian models that show the suppression of specific Zitterbewegung oscillations.

arXiv:2512.14868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the the large-$n$ dynamics of the long-range quantum $O(n)$ model, focusing on the strong long-range regime $\alpha<d$. The dynamics of the model exhibits non-trivial features on mesoscopic timescales $t\sim\ln N$, due to the activation of parametric resonances of the nearly degenerate quantum modes. By using recent results establishing the integrability of the large-$n$ limit, we derive the resonance conditions, and construct the reduced multi-mode Hamiltonian that captures the finite-size dynamics. This framework yields the resonance phase diagram and clarifies when and how deviations from mean-field behavior arise. In particular, the presence of multiple resonant modes enhances the logarithmic growth of entanglement and leads to spatially modulated correlations.

arXiv:2512.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of particles driven by colored noise in a flashing ratchet potential, focusing on both non-interacting and single-file interacting regimes. The model incorporates memory effects via a non-Markovian friction kernel, leading to superdiffusive dynamics and enhanced currents in the absence of interactions. However, when particles are constrained to single-file motion with hard-core repulsion, the same non-Markovian noise induces a dynamical transition: initial superdiffusion gives way to the formation of static clusters, ultimately suppressing net current. This transition occurs without a critical density and results from the interplay between noise persistence and the ratchet's potential. Our numerical results reveal a universal scaling behavior for the mean square displacement across densities, suggesting robustness of the clustering mechanism. These findings have potential implications for transport in crowded or confined systems such as colloidal suspensions, molecular motors in cellular environments, or microfluidic devices, where controlling noise and crowding can be used to tune transport efficiency.

arXiv:2512.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the accuracy of the cumulant expansion (CE) method, combined with the independent-particle approximation (IPA), for calculating charge mobility in electron-phonon systems. As representative testbeds, we consider the Peierls and Fr\"ohlich models, which serve as simplified frameworks where accurate or numerically exact benchmarks are available. These are used to compare the CE results with those obtained using the Boltzmann formalism, the Migdal approximation, and its self consistent extension-approaches that are presently the most commonly employed alternatives for transport calculations. Supported by analytical arguments based on spectral sum rules and by our previous results for the Holstein model, we argue that, for weak to moderate coupling strengths and not-too-low temperatures, the CE within the IPA framework yields accurate results. In the case of the Peierls model, the role of vertex corrections is also discussed.

Abstract: In superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), the superconducting diode effect may be generated by interference of multiple harmonic components in the current-phase relationships (CPRs) of different branches forming SQUID loops. Through the inclusion of two gate-tunable Josephson junctions in series in each interference branch of a double-loop SQUID, we demonstrate independent control over both the harmonic content and the amplitude of three interfering CPRs, facilitating significant improvement in the maximum diode efficiency. Through optimized gate-controlled tuning of individual Josephson energies, diode efficiency exceeding 50% is demonstrated. Flux-dependent oscillations show quantitative agreement with a simple model of SQUID operation.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of a novel carbon allotrope characterized by quasi-tetragonal atomic motifs and quasi-two-dimensional structural behavior. Structural analysis reveals an open framework composed of alternating diamond-like and square units, while thermodynamic assessments indicate a negative formation energy, suggesting high intrinsic stability. Phonon spectra confirm dynamical robustness, and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations at 1000~K validate its thermal resilience. Furthermore, the system exhibits an indirect bandgap of 1.58 eV at the HSE06 level, anisotropic mechanical behavior, and a broadband optical response, reinforcing its potential for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications. The highly anisotropic mechanical behavior is characterized by an in-plane Young's modulus ranging from 80 to 550 GPa, depending on crystallographic direction. Additionally, the electronic transport properties exhibit pronounced anisotropy, with hole mobilities reaching up to 5.83 x 10^6 cm^2/V . s and electron mobilities up to 6.40 x 10^6 cm^2/V . s along different crystallographic directions, highlighting the material's potential for directionally selective nanoelectronic device applications.

Abstract: The discovery of a minimum energy pathway (MEP) between metastable states is crucial for scientific tasks including catalyst and biomolecular design. However, the standard nudged elastic band (NEB) algorithm requires hundreds to tens of thousands of compute-intensive simulations, making applications to complex systems prohibitively expensive. We introduce Neural Network Bayesian Algorithm Execution (NN-BAX), a framework that jointly learns the energy landscape and the MEP. NN-BAX sequentially fine-tunes a foundation model by actively selecting samples targeted at improving the MEP. Tested on Lennard-Jones and Embedded Atom Method systems, our approach achieves a one to two order of magnitude reduction in energy and force evaluations with negligible loss in MEP accuracy and demonstrates scalability to >100-dimensional systems. This work is therefore a promising step towards removing the computational barrier for MEP discovery in scientifically relevant systems, suggesting that weeks-long calculations may be achieved in hours or days with minimal loss in accuracy.

arXiv:2512.14996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation-induced segregation (RIS) and chemical redistribution in structural alloys can significantly degrade material performance, ultimately leading to failure. In this study, building on previous work by the authors [1], we investigate how the dimensional characteristics of sinks influence solute concentration distributions and segregation behavior. Specifically, we utilize a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model to simulate atomic-scale diffusion and analyze segregation processes in an Fe-3Cr alloy. Our analysis includes three representative sink geometries: one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) planar sinks to capture the effects of sink dimensionality on Cr segregation at grain boundaries (GBs). We also found solutions of concentration and segregation profiles in these cases as well as for a 3D spherical sink. KMC simulations are performed over a range of temperatures to assess thermal effects on Cr redistribution. The results reveal distinct segregation profiles and concentration gradients, although the dependence with sink density seems to remain linear in all cases with planar sinks. The analytical results show that this is not the case in spherical domains, with a more complex dependence of segregation on sink density. Our finite difference solutions for domains including 2D and 3D planer sinks show agreement with corresponding KMC results.

Abstract: Europium-doped gallium nitride (GaN:Eu) is a promising platform for classical and quantum optoelectronic applications. When grown using organometallic vapor-phase epitaxy, the dominant red emission from Eu exhibits an inhomogeneous photoluminescence (PL) spectrum due to contributions from several non-equivalent incorporation sites that can be distinguished with combined excitation emission spectroscopy. Energy transfer from the GaN bandgap to the majority site is inefficient, limiting the performance of GaN:Eu LEDs and resulting in an inhomogeneous emission spectrum dominated by disproportionate contributions from minority sites. In this work, we use site-selective spectroscopy to characterize the photoluminescence properties of delta-doped structures with alternating doped and undoped layers of varying thicknesses and demonstrate that they selectively enhance emission from the majority site when compared to uniformly-doped samples. Samples with 2-nm and 10-nm doped layers show much greater PL intensity per Eu concentration as well as more efficient energy transfer to the majority site, which are both highly desirable for creating power-efficient LEDs. Meanwhile, a sample with 1-nm doped layers shows emission only from the majority site, resulting in a narrow, homogeneous emission spectrum that is desirable for quantum technologies. This utilization of delta-doping has the potential to be broadly applicable for engineering desirable defect properties in rare-earth doped semiconductors.

Abstract: X-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) spectroscopy is an experimental technique for element-specific spin dynamics in the GHz regime and has been utilized to study spintronic materials. The XFMR signal is usually obtained by detecting X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) emitted from a sample substrate. Here, we report the development of an XFMR spectrometer that is designed to place a photodetector for XEOL detection outside an ultra-high-vacuum chamber. This configuration allows for the easy replacement of detectors, such as photodiodes, CCD cameras, and spectrometers, depending on the experimental requirements. We demonstrated the measurement of XEOL spectra from MgO using a visible light spectrometer as well as the detection of XFMR signals originating from the spin precession of a permalloy (Ni80Fe20) thin film using a photodiode detector. The XFMR spectrometer with an out-of-vacuum photodetector expands possibilities for advanced measurements such as XFMR microscopy.

arXiv:2512.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.

arXiv:2512.15041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, a lattice analogue of fractional quantum Hall effect, offers a unique pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation and deep insights into the interplay of topology and strong correlations. The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux. Our work reveals a profound interplay between quantum geometry and many-body correlation, and significantly expands the design space for exploring FQAH effect and flat-band correlation phenomena in general.

Abstract: Triangular-lattice cobaltates with glaserite-type $X_2Y$Co($T$O$_4)_2$ structure provide an ideal platform to investigate intriguing quantum magnetism. Here we report a comprehensive study of the structural and magnetic properties of a triangular-lattice cobalt vanadate $\rm Na_2SrCo(VO_4)_2$. Room-temperature x-ray and neutron powder diffraction confirm that $\rm Na_2SrCo(VO_4)_2$ crystallizes in the monoclinic $P2_1/c$ space group with slightly distorted triangular layers of $\rm Co^{2+}$ ions. Magnetization measurements reveal a ferromagnetic transition at $T\rm_C \approx 3.4~{\rm K}$, where a sharp $\lambda$-type anomaly is observed in the specific heat. The magnetic entropy recovered up to 55 K approaches 90$\%$ of $R{\rm ln}2$, supporting an effective spin-1/2 state of Co$^{2+}$ ions at low temperature. Neutron diffraction at 2.3 K (below $T_{\rm C}$) further confirms a long-range canted ferromagnetic order with the Co$^{2+}$ moments aligned in the $ac$ plane and the ordered moment size of $\sim$ 2.6 $\mu\rm_{B}$. Comparing with its sister compounds with a trigonal symmetry, $\rm Na_2BaCo(VO_4)_2$ with a collinear ferromagnetic structure and the recently discovered spin supersolid candidate $\rm Na_2BaCo(PO_4)_2$ with a distinct Y-like antiferromagnetic ground state, this study indicates the decisive role of the $T{\rm O_4}$ tetrahedra in tuning exchange interactions and contrasting magnetic behaviors of these glaserite-structure compounds.

Abstract: We study impacts of spin-orbit interactions on the spin susceptibility in quasicrystal superconductors, motivated by the anomolous superconducting properties in the van der Waals quasicrystal Ta$_{1.6}$Te under magnetic fields. We consider the Penrose tiling model with $s$-wave pairing as a representative system and include anisotropic spin-orbit interactions allowed for the quasicrystal structure. It is shown that the spin-momentum locking locally takes place in the quasicrystal, and electron motion and spin directions are tightly connected at each spatial position in the real space. As a result, the spin susceptibility is enhanced for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields in the presence of a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. For an Ising-type spin-orbit interaction, the spin susceptibility only for in-plane magnetic fields is increased, while the out-of-plane spin susceptibility is almost unchanged. When there are both kinds of the spin-orbit interactions, temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility for any field directions is suppressed.

arXiv:2512.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of several quasiperiodic disorders and their continuous interpolation with the Aubry-Andre (AA) potential on the Hofstadter butterfly using mean field approximation at zero temperature for a two-dimensional square lattice. Weak disorder mildly smears the fractal spectrum, while strong quasiperiodic potentials destroy the butterfly and generate multiple energy gaps. The AA potential produces the strongest spectral restructuring, creating prominent gaps near half-filling. Interpolating AA with other quasiperiodic potentials reveals competing gap-opening mechanisms, ranging from AA-dominated gaps at small interpolation parameters to a robust half-filling gap generated by the competing disorders at large parameters. Entanglement entropy follows the area law at low and high magnetic fields but shows pronounced deviations at intermediate fields, with opposite trends for strong AA versus other quasiperiodic potentials. Localization analysis using IPR and NPR confirms enhanced localization with increasing disorder; the AA potential yields the largest IPR, with notable field dependence. Interpolation produces smooth crossovers between distinct localization regimes.

arXiv:2512.15132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten is a leading candidate material for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors. Extensive studies have been performed to better understand its behavior under irradiation. Recent experiments of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode indicated a marked reduction in radiation damage in single-crystal tungsten samples irradiated by self-ions when the irradiation temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 K. However, the underlying mechanism for this damage reduction remains unclear. In this work, by combining Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a pronounced surface effect at elevated temperatures, characterized by a significant reduction of dislocation density near the surface. We demonstrate how our unique analysis method can clearly resolve a dislocation-free zone and a transition region with suppressed defect density before reaching the bulk value. The strong surface effect at elevated temperatures is explained by considering the coherent drift motion of dislocation loops towards the surface, highlighting alternative perspectives on mitigating radiation damage by increasing dislocation mobility.

arXiv:2512.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knitted fabrics exhibit high flexibility due to their periodic loop structures formed by bent yarns. Under compressive loading, they develop three-dimensional (3D) wrinkling patterns that reflect nonlinear interactions between yarn elasticity and local loop deformations, as observed when the sleeves of a sweater are rolled up. Despite their widespread use in garments and medical textiles, the relationship between loop-level geometry and macroscopic buckling remains less understood. Here, we investigate the 3D deformation of knitted fabrics wrapped around a rigid cylinder under uniaxial compression. Circumferential and axial stitch numbers are systematically varied to determine how loop geometry affects the evolution of wrinkle patterns. Samples with a small number of circumferential stitches exhibit sequential wrinkle formation from the compressed end, leading to an accordion-like wrinkle pattern, whereas those with a larger number of stitches form helical wrinkles simultaneously across the surface. Wrinkle morphology changes progressively with stitch geometry, accompanied by systematic variations in compressive force, loop deformation, and helical wrinkle angle. The development of helical wrinkles originates from subtle structural asymmetries introduced during manufacturing processes, including the tension applied during knitting and the direction of sample assembly. These results demonstrate that small variations in local loop deformation can lead to substantial differences in wrinkle morphology, highlighting the sensitivity of macroscopic buckling to microscopic structural features. The study establishes a direct link between loop-level mechanics and global deformation behavior, providing a basis for the predictive design of knitted structures with tailored mechanical responses and complex 3D patterns.

Abstract: Narrow-gap Mott insulators promise exceptional opportunities for voltage-controlled magnetic textures in low-dissipation spintronics, although their prediction remains challenging. Here we employ a density functional theory-guided approach to predict a narrow charge-transfer gap (127 meV) in the chiral cubic frustrated oxide Co$_5$TeO$_8$. Comprehensive neutron scattering and magnetometry reveal proper-screw Bloch-type helices with field- and temperature-tunable pitch of 5.7-10 nm embedded in a complex phase diagram with eight distinct phases. Ab initio wavefunction calculations demonstrate site-dependent single-ion anisotropy exceeding Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions by an order of magnitude, establishing the anisotropy-frustration interplay as the stabilization mechanism, contrasting starkly with DM-dominated cubic helimagnets. Sharp capacitance anomalies at phase boundaries confirm intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling throughout the phase diagram. Co$_5$TeO$_8$ thus provides a platform for voltage-tunable sub-10 nm magnetic textures, demonstrating effective theory-guided discovery of functional magnetic materials in correlated oxides.

Abstract: Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries provide many benefits, including high theoretical capacity, a low redox potential, and the abundance of Zn in Earth's crust. However, the benefits are often compromised by severe side reactions and dendrite growth, limiting their practical application. To mitigate these drawbacks, many studies have focused on high-concentration electrolytes to desolvate the Zn2+ solvation shell from water and to reduce the amount of free water. In this study, a methodology is proposed to achieve the benefits of highly concentrated electrolytes while using low salt concentrations. 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (5MP) was introduced as a safe and polar cosolvent capable of anchoring free water molecules through hydrogen bonding, enabled by its carbonyl and secondary amine groups. Additionally, by adding a co-salt containing a chaotropic ion, it is possible to disrupt the water network, enabling the development of high-performance aqueous Zn batteries. The synergy between anchoring water molecules and disrupting the overall water network proved to be an effective strategy for enhancing the overall Zn battery performance in a symmetric Zn cell, with lifetimes exceeding 2000 hours and 1400 hours at 1 C and 5 C, respectively. Analysis of the recovered Zn anode confirmed that the combination of 5MP and chaotropic ions enabled Zn deposition along the energetically favorable (002) plane, with no signs of surface dehydration observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, long-term stability tests using a carbonyl-rich COF- and NaVO-based cathodes at various current densities further demonstrated the benefits of this approach. This work showcases the universality of a diluted electrolyte in combination with 5MP and chaotropic ions, bridging the gap between laboratory research and real-world applications.

Abstract: Quad-helicoid surface states (QHSSs) are unique surface states with two pairs of helicoid surface states in topological semimetals such as Dirac semimetals. So far, topologically protected QHSSs are shown to appear in spinless systems with two $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetries and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry ($\mathcal{G}$: glide, $\mathcal{T}$: time-reversal). In this paper, we show that topologically protected QHSSs also appear in spinful/spinless systems with only two $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetries by defining new topological charges and establishing the bulk-surface correspondence. We first define a local $Z_2\times Z_2$ monopole charge for gapless nodes at $\mathcal{GT}$-invariant high-symmetry points and a global $Z_2$ charge reflecting the global topological feature of $\mathcal{GT}$-symmetric topological semimetals. Next, we show that the latter $Z_2$ classification corresponds to the presence or absence of QHSSs on the surface with two $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetries. In addition, we provide simplified formulas of the $Z_2$ charge under additional symmetries, and clarify some symmetry conditions where QHSSs are filling-enforced.

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of electronic transport across the topological-trivial phase transition in ${\rm In}_{x}({\rm Bi}_{0.3}{\rm Sb}_{0.7})_{2-x}{\rm Te}_3$ thin films by systematically tuning the indium concentration $x$. Increasing $x$ reduces the effective spin-orbit coupling, driving a topological quantum phase transition near $x \approx 7\%$, and at higher disorder a crossover from diffusive to strongly localized transport around $x \approx 15\%$. In the diffusive regime, the magnetoconductance is well described by the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka formalism, with the evolution of the WAL prefactor $\alpha$ correlating with the band-inversion transition. Beyond the diffusive limit, transport crosses into variable-range hopping, accompanied by a striking reversal of magnetoconductance from negative to positive. The observed positive low-field magnetoconductance, its pronounced anisotropy, and its temperature evolution point to an orbital origin of the response. These features are naturally captured by incorporating the incoherent hopping mechanism of Raikh \textit{et al.} together with wavefunction shrinkage, rather than by conventional quantum-correction frameworks. Our results provide a unified picture of how topology, spin-orbit coupling, and disorder collectively determine the full field-temperature magnetotransport landscape in this material class, establishing a clear experimental link between the topological phase transition and the onset of incoherent hopping-dominated conduction.

Abstract: Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) offers a powerful route to bridging the materials and pressure gaps between surface science and powder catalysis. Using a newly developed IRAS setup optimised for dielectric single crystals, we investigate CO adsorption on the model single-atom catalyst Rh/Fe3O4(001). IRAS resolves three species: monocarbonyls at twofold coordinated Rh1 sites, monocarbonyls at fivefold coordinated Rh sites, and gem-dicarbonyls at twofold coordinated Rh1 sites. Under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, Rh1CO monocarbonyl species dominate. Rh1(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl formation is kinetically hindered and occurs predominantly through CO-induced dissociation of Rh2 dimers rather than sequential CO adsorption. The sequential-adsorption pathway to Rh1(CO)2 becomes accessible at millibar CO pressures as evidenced by near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy (NAP-STM). These findings validate the kinetic picture inferred from UHV measurements and computational modelling and link the UHV behaviour to that expected under realistic reaction conditions. Assignments of the vibrational frequencies to individual species rely on isotopic labelling, thermal treatments, and a review of previous SPM, XPS, and TPD data, supported by density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. While theory provides qualitative insight, such as the instability of dicarbonyls on fivefold coordinated Rh atoms, it does not yet reproduce experimental frequencies quantitatively and is sensitive to the computational parameters, highlighting the need for robust experimental benchmarks. The spectroscopic fingerprints established here provide a reliable foundation for identifying Rh coordination environments in oxide-supported single-atom catalysts.

arXiv:2512.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental and theoretical study of the mechanics of an \emph{adhesive tape loop}, formed by bending a straight rectangular strip with adhesive properties, and prescribing an overlap between the two ends. For a given combination of the adhesive strength and the extent of the overlap, the loop may unravel, it may stay in equilibrium, or open up quasi-statically to settle into an equilibrium with a smaller overlap. We define the state space of an adhesive tape loop with two parameters: a non-dimensional adhesion strength, and the extent of overlap normalized by the total length of the loop. We conduct experiments with adhesive tape loops fabricated out of sheets of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and record their states. We rationalize the experimental observations using a simple scaling argument, followed by a detailed theoretical model based on Kirchhoff rod theory. The predictions made by the theoretical model, namely the shape of the loops the states corresponding to equilibrium, show good agreement with the experimental data. Our model may potentially be used to deduce the strength of self-adhesion in sticky soft materials by simply measuring the smallest overlap needed to maintain a tape loop in equilibrium.

arXiv:2512.15216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kittel--Shore Hamiltonian characterizes $N$ spins with identical long-range interactions, and the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ coalgebra has been proven to be a symmetry of this model, which can be exactly solved. By using quantum groups and, in particular, $\mathfrak{su}_{q}(2)$, this Hamiltonian was deformed. In this work, we study the thermodynamic properties of this deformed model for spin-$1/2$ particles. In particular, we discuss how this deformation affects the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, magnetisation, and phase transitions as a function of the parameter $q$ of the deformation and compare them with those of the undeformed model. Deformation was found to shift the thermodynamic behaviours to higher temperatures and alter the phase transitions. The potential applications of this $q$-deformed model for describing few-spin quantum systems with non-identical couplings are discussed.

arXiv:2512.15247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-optical switching in a ferromagnetic spin valve is studied here using atomistic spin drift-diffusion dynamics, which includes contributions from spin pumping and superdiffusive transport. The switching is governed by two main sources of current transients: i) spin currents pumped by the reference layer, and ii) spin-polarized currents due to non-equilibrium hot electrons excited by the laser pulse. In particular, an initial superdiffusive forward flow of electrons, polarized by the free layer, is generated. This drives parallel to antiparallel switching of the free layer through accumulation of minority spins at the reference layer. A diffusive backward flow of electrons, repolarized by the reference layer, follows the initial superdiffusive flow as the charge distribution re-equilibrates. Due to the pulse width-dependent asymmetric amplitudes of the forward and backward transients, the latter can drive antiparallel to parallel switching, and create multi-domain structures at higher laser fluences and longer pulses. The results obtained here are in agreement with experimental observations, providing a framework for self-consistent modelling of all-optical switching in metallic heterostructures.

Abstract: Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.

Abstract: Kapitza-Dirac scattering, the diffraction of matter waves from a standing light field, is widely utilized in ultracold gases, but its behavior in the strongly interacting regime is an open question. Here we develop a numerically-exact two-body description of Kapitza-Dirac scattering for two contact-interacting atoms in a one-dimensional harmonic trap subjected to a pulsed optical lattice, enabling us to obtain the numerically exact dynamics. We map how interaction strength, lattice depth, lattice wavenumber, and pulse duration reshape the diffraction pattern, leading to an interaction-dependent population redistribution in real and momentum-space. By comparing the exact dynamics to an impulsive sudden-approximation description, we delineate the parameter regimes where it remains accurate and those, notably at strong attraction and small lattice wavenumber, where it fails. Our results provide a controlled few-body benchmark for interacting Kapitza-Dirac scattering and quantitative guidance for Kapitza-Dirac-based probes of ultracold atomic systems.

arXiv:2512.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic first-principles study of substitutional 3d transition-metal (TM) defects in CsPbI3 using the spin-polarized GGA+U framework. TM incorporation is generally energetically favorable and induces lattice distortions that are strongly localized around the defect site, preserving the overall structural integrity of the host. Analysis of defect formation energies and electronic structure shows that, with the exception of Sc and Ti, CsPbI3 exhibits a strong resistance to deep trap formation. Most TM substitutions instead introduce resonant states that hybridize with the band edges, consistent with the defect-tolerant nature of the material. While these states can modify the band gap, they do not generate isolated mid-gap traps. The observed distortions arise from strain-driven Van Vleck modes governed by ionic-radius mismatch, electronegativity differences, and TM-I orbital overlap, with amplitudes that decay rapidly away from the defect. Spin-polarized calculations reveal significant TM-induced spin polarization on the ligands and, in some cases, on neighboring Pb atoms, reflecting variations in covalency and hybridization across the 3d series. Together, these results establish a unified picture in which local structural response, electronic hybridization, and spin polarization jointly control the stability and electronic impact of TM defects in CsPbI3 , identifying dopants that are electronically benign or detrimental.

Abstract: Superconductor LaRh$_2$As$_2$ has the same crystal structures as CeRh$_2$As$_2$, which exhibits superconducting (SC) multiphase in the $c$-axis magnetic field. Although the SC transition temperatures $T_c$ are similar, around 0.3 K, LaRh$_2$As$_2$ shows conventional type-II superconductivity with a small upper critical field $H_{c2}\sim$ 10 mT. At present, the SC properties of LaRh$_2$As$_2$ have not been clarified yet. We performed $^{75}$As-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on LaRh$_2$As$_2$ to investigate the SC properties and gap structure. $1/T_1$ shows a clear coherence peak just below $T_c$ and an exponential decrease at lower temperatures, suggesting full-gap $s$-wave superconductivity. The numerical calculations based on an $s$-wave SC model reveal an SC gap size of $\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} \sim 1.48$, consistent with the weak-coupling $s$-wave superconductivity. These results suggest that the 4$f$ electrons in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ not only enhance the orbital limiting field but also contribute to the formation of unconventional superconductivity with SC multiphase.

Abstract: Performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations requires a careful choice of computational parameters to ensure convergence and obtain meaningful results. This represents a particularly important problem for high-throughput and agentic workflows, where due to computational cost, any additional convergence studies are preferably to be avoided. So, there is a need for tools and models which are able to predict DFT parameters from basic input information, such as a structure. In this work, we develop a machine learning approach to predict the appropriate k-point sampling in DFT calculations and generate the input files for Quantum Espresso self-consistent field calculations. To achieve this, we first generated a training dataset comprising over 20,000 materials, each with an energy convergence threshold of 1 meV/atom. Several ML models were evaluated for their ability to predict k-points distance, and uncertainty estimation was incorporated to guarantee that, for at least 85-95% of compounds, the predicted k-distance lies within the convergence region. The best-performing models are made publicly available through an open-access web application.

arXiv:2512.15304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is a key nonreciprocal phenomenon with broad relevance for superconducting electronics. Using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations, we predict and quantify a superconducting diode effect arising solely from geometric chirality imposed to a conventional superconductor. The helical geometry and magnetic-field-induced screening currents produce inequivalent critical currents for opposite polarities. The diode efficiency reaches a maximum when one current direction first nucleates vortices, revealing a chirality-controlled crossover between screening- and vortex-dominated nonreciprocity. These results establish mesoscopic geometric chirality as a robust mechanism for supercurrent rectification in an achiral superconductor. They suggest an experimentally accessible route towards 3D superconducting diodes for multi-level integrated quantum circuits.

Abstract: The hard sphere model is widely used in description of fluids and solid media as a zero approximation to real systems. Despite the uniqueness of the model, few analytical results are known for it, both for the 2D and 3D cases. In present research we have investigated melting of the hard disk system by considering accumulation of extended defects of a certain type in the crystaline phase, and jamming of the disk packing. It results in formulation of melting criteria with lower and upper bounds on volume ratio at melting transition: $25/21 \le V/V_0 \le 5/4$. It was found that, in full agreement with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young theory, the 2D crystal melts into anisotropic liquid. The second transition, which is the transition between anisotropic and isotropic liquid has volume ratio $5/4 \le V/V_0 \le 13/9$.

Abstract: We have simulated an automaton version of the quenched Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (qKPZ) equation in one and two dimensions in order to study the scaling properties of the interface at the depinning transition. Specifically, the $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\theta$, and $\delta$ critical exponents characterizing the surface kinetic roughening and depinning behaviors have been directly computed from the simulations. In addition, by studying the height-difference correlation function in real space, we have also been able to directly compute the dynamic correlation length and its associated dynamic critical exponent $z$. The full sets of scaling exponents are largely compatible with those of the Directed Percolation Depinning universality class for one and two dimensional interfaces. Furthermore, we have computed numerically the probability density function (PDF) of the front fluctuations in the growth regime, finding its asymptotic form in one and two dimensions. While the PDF features strongly non-Gaussian skewness and kurtosis values, it also differs from the PDF of the KPZ equation with time-dependent noise for physical substrate dimensions, both in the central part and at the tails of the distribution.

Abstract: The study of spectrum statistics, such as the consecutive-gap ratio distribution, has revealed many interesting properties of many-body complex systems. Here we propose a two-parameter surmise expression for such distribution to describe the crossover between the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) and Poisson statistics. This crossover is observed in the isotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain with disordered local field, exhibiting the Many-Body Localization (MBL) transition. Inspired by the analysis of stability in dynamical systems, this crossover is presented as a flow pattern in the parameter space, with the Poisson statistics being the fixed point of the system, which represents the MBL phase. We also analyze an isotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain with disordered local exchange coupling and a zero magnetic field. In this case, the system never achieves the MBL phase because of the spin rotation symmetry. This case is more sensitive to finite-size effects than the previous one, and thus the flow pattern resembles a two-dimensional random walk close to its fixed point. We propose a system of linearized stochastic differential equations to estimate this fixed point. We study the continuous-state Markov process that governs the probability of finding the system close to this fixed point as the disorder strength increases. In addition, we discuss the conditions under which the stationary probability distribution is given by a bivariate normal distribution.

Abstract: Valleytronics aims to control electrons in a valley-specific manner for quantum information manipulation. Due to their strong in-plane anisotropy, which enables polarization-controlled optical transitions to distinct nondegenerate valleys, group-IV monochalcogenides have been recently proposed as promising candidates for next-generation valleytronic materials. However, ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics following optical preparation of valley-polarized states remain completely unexplored in these systems. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme-ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with time-dependent Boltzmann equation simulations, we investigate ultrafast valley polarization dynamics following polarization-controlled photoexcitation in SnSe. We show that selective excitation to valleys at global conduction minima yields nearly unity and time-independent valley polarization. In contrast, photoexcitation to the other valley channel leads to ultrafast decay and reversal of valley polarization on sub-picosecond timescales due to intervalley scattering mediated by strong electron-phonon coupling with an optical phonon mode. Our findings reveal strongly anisotropic and radically different nonequilibrium valley physics than in most common two-dimensional valleytronics materials.

Abstract: Out-of-time ordered correlators are a probe of how the information of an initial perturbation is effectively scrambled under unitary time evolution, widely used to study quantum chaos. They have also been used to demonstrate that information is trapped in the zero dimensional edge modes of topological insulators and superconductors, and does not become scrambled. Here we study scrambling in two dimensional topological models. In the bulk the butterfly velocity, the speed at which the out-of-time ordered correlator spreads, gains a directional dependence from the underlying lattice. Furthermore when there are chiral or helical edge modes present these cause a form of dynamical scarring. The information about an initial perturbation on the boundary of the system travels around the edge, carried by the edge modes, but is not scrambled over very long time scales. The direction and speed of the scars are given by the velocities of the linearly dispersing edge modes. We further show that these scars do not interact, passing through each other. We back up these results with analytical and numerical calculations on exemplary models.

Abstract: At strong on-site repulsion $ U $, the fermionic Hubbard model realizes an extremely correlated electron system. In this regime, it is natural to derive the low-energy physics with the help of non-canonical operators acting on a projected Hilbert space without double occupancies. Using a strong-coupling functional renormalization group technique, we study the physics of such extreme correlations in the strict $ U = \infty $ limit, where only kinematic interactions due to the Hilbert space projection remain. For nearest-neighbor hopping on a square lattice, we find that the electronic spectrum is significantly renormalized, with bandwidth and quasi-particle residue strongly decreasing with increasing electron density. On the other hand, damping and particle-hole asymmetry increase, while a polaronic continuum forms in the hole sector, below the single-particle band. Fermi liquid phenomenology applies only at low densities, where the system remains paramagnetic. At higher densities, we find a bad metal with strong magnetic correlations, indicating that the ground state is the Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities and a stripe antiferromagnet at intermediate densities. Both in the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic regimes, we observe a violation of Luttinger's theorem.

Abstract: Designing lithium-ion batteries for long service life remains a challenge, as most cells are optimized for beginning-of-life metrics such as energy density, often overlooking how design and operating conditions shape degradation. This work introduces a degradation-aware design framework built around finite, interacting reservoirs (lithium, porosity, and electrolyte) that are depleted over time by coupled degradation processes.
  We extend a physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman model to include validated mechanisms such as SEI growth, lithium plating, cracking, and solvent dry-out, and simulate how small design changes impact lifetime. Across more than 1,000 cycles, we find that increasing electrolyte volume by just 1% or porosity by 5% can extend service life by over 30% without significantly affecting cell energy density. However, lithium excess, while boosting initial capacity, can accelerate failure if not supported by sufficient structural or ionic buffers.
  Importantly, we show that interaction between reservoirs is crucial to optimal design: multi-reservoir tuning yields either synergistic benefits or compound failures, depending on operating conditions. We also quantify how C-rate and operating temperature influence degradation pathways, emphasizing the need for co-optimized design and usage profiles.
  By reframing degradation as a problem of managing finite internal reservoirs, this work offers a predictive and mechanistic foundation for designing lithium-ion batteries that balance energy, durability, and application-specific needs.

Abstract: Models of interacting hysteretic elements, called hysterons, capture the sequential response and complex memory effects in a wide range of complex systems and can guide the design of intelligent metamaterials. However, even simple models with few hysterons feature a bewildering number and variety of behaviors. Here we study the hysteron model in two physically relevant limits, where {the} response {of a hysteron system} is easier to understand. First, when the hysteron span - the gap between its two hysteretic transitions - dominates all other scales, the range of pathways encoded in transition graphs (t-graphs) becomes limited because many avalanches {are} absent. Second, when the hysteron span becomes vanishingly small, hysterons behave as interacting binary spins, {which require avalanches in order to} exhibit nontrivial pathways. Finally we show that hysterons can be mimicked by pairs of strongly interacting spins, {such} that collections of $n$ interacting hysterons can be mapped to $2n$ interacting spins, albeit {via} highly specific interactions. {Altogether,} our work provides a deeper understanding of the role of the hysteron parameters on their collective behavior, and points to connections and differences between spin- and hysteron-based models of complex matter.

Abstract: We develop a quantum kinetic theory of two-dimensional electron gases in which exchange is treated self-consistently at the Hartree-Fock level and enters as a nonlocal, momentum-dependent field in phase space. By starting from the Coulomb Hamiltonian, we derive a Hartree-Fock-Wigner equation for the electronic Wigner function and obtain a closed fluid model with exchange-corrected pressure, force, and current. For a single layer, we show that exchange renormalizes the Fermi velocity and can drive a long-wavelength plasmonic instability at low densities. In coupled layers, the same framework predicts acoustic-optical mode coupling, and an instability forming long-lived charge-imbalance patterns that are not predicted by classical Vlasov and Boltzmann models. Finally, we apply the kinetic model to the Coulomb drag problem and show how exchange substantially enhances the drag resistivity in dilute GaAs double wells, quantitatively matching experimental observations.

Abstract: Point defects introduce localized electronic states that critically affect carrier trapping, recombination, and transport in functional materials. The associated charge transition levels (CTLs) can depend on temperature, requiring accurate treatment of vibrational and electronic free-energy contributions. In this work, we use machine-learned interatomic potentials to efficiently compute temperature-dependent CTLs for vacancies in MgO, LiF, and CsSnBr3. Using thermodynamic integration, we quantify free-energy differences between charge states and calculate the vibrational entropy contributions at finite temperatures. We find that CTLs shift with temperature in MgO, LiF and CsSnBr3 from both entropy and electronic contributions. Notably, in CsSnBr3 a neutral charge state becomes thermodynamically stable above 60 K, introducing a temperature-dependent Fermi-level window absent at 0 K. We show that the widely used static, zero-kelvin defect formalism can miss both quantitative CTL shifts and the qualitative emergence of new stable charge states.

Apurba Biswas, Thomas Gu\'erin

arXiv:2512.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare events refer to qualitatively unlikely events whose realization can nevertheless have important consequences. Typically, the prediction of the kinetics of these events relies on Arrhenius laws, with exponentially distributed waiting times, and no correlations between successive occurrences. However, this description breaks down in the presence of long-term memory, as has been observed in the contexts of geophysical time series or protein dynamics. So far, existing analytical approaches do not quantify the correlations between rare events due to long-term memory. Here, for non-Markovian Gaussian processes, we determine analytically the impact of long-term memory on the distribution of first and second passage times to a rarely reached threshold. This distribution is non-exponential, thus going beyond the Arrhenius paradigm. We obtain an explicit expression for the covariance between the first and second passage times, and we predict how the mean time to the next extreme event depends on the previous passage time, illustrating the phenomenon of clustering of extreme events. These analytical results, validated through extensive stochastic simulations, shed lights on the strong correlation between successive occurrences of extreme events due to long-term memory.

arXiv:2512.15498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the electromechanical response of the 180 degree ferroelectric domain wall in tetragonal PbTiO3 by combining first-principles calculations with a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) description. Using regular multidomain structures with varying domain-wall density, we extract polarization profiles and lattice distortions and map them onto the continuum model to determine conventional (homogeneous) and gradient (inhomogeneous) electrostriction. Conventional electrostriction yields only a small negative length change of the sample, whereas gradient electrostriction--arising from the coupling between strain and polarization gradients--produces a positive contribution nearly an order of magnitude larger and localized at the wall core. Our results demonstrate that gradient electrostriction dominates the electromechanical response of 180 degree walls in PbTiO3, supporting its inclusion in LGD models that stabilize Bloch-type domain wall structures.

arXiv:2512.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of oxidation-resistant high-entropy alloy (HEA) bond coats is restricted by the limited understanding of how multi-principal element interactions govern scale formation across temperatures. This study uncovers new oxidation trends in NiCoCrAl HEAs using a data-driven analysis of high-fidelity experimental oxidation data. The results reveal a clear temperature-dependent transition between alumina- and chromia-dominated protection, identifying the compositional regimes where alloys rich in Al dominate at $\ge1150$ {\deg}C, mixed Al-Cr chemistries are optimal at intermediate temperatures, and, unexpectedly, Cr-rich low-Al alloys perform best at 850 {\deg}C-challenging the assumption that high Al is universally required. The effects of Hf and Y are shown to be strongly composition-dependent with Hf producing the largest global reduction in oxidation rate, while Y becomes effective primarily in NiCo-lean alloys. Y-Hf co-doping offers consistent improvement but exhibits site-saturation behavior. These insights identify new high-performing HEA bond-coat families, including $\mathrm{Ni_{17}Co_{23}Cr_{30}Al_{30}}$ as a substitute for conventional mutlilayer thermal barrier coatings.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and hBN, exhibit intriguing properties that are sensitive to their atomic-scale structures and can be further enriched through van der Waals (vdW) integration. However, the precise synthesis and clean integration of 2D materials remain challenging. Here, using graphene or hBN as a vdW capping layer, we create a nano-confined environment that directs the growth kinetics of 2D TMDs (e.g., NbSe2 and MoS2), enabling precise formation of TMD monolayers with tailored morphologies, from isolated monolayer domains to large-scale continuous films and intrinsically-patterned rings. Moreover, Janus S-Mo-Se monolayers are synthesized with atomic precision via vdW-protected bottom-plane chalcogen substitution. Importantly, our approach simultaneously produces ultraclean vdW interfaces. This in situ encapsulation reliably preserves air-sensitive materials, as evidenced by the enhanced superconductivity of nano-confined NbSe2 monolayers. Altogether, our study establishes a versatile platform for the controlled synthesis and integration of 2D TMDs for advanced applications.

arXiv:2512.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium driven dynamics at topologically nontrivial quantum critical points (QCPs),and find that topological edge modes at criticality give rise to anomalous universal dynamical scaling behavior. By analyzing the driven dynamics of bulk and boundary order parameters at topologically distinct Ising QCPs, we demonstrate that, while the bulk dynamics remain indistinguishable and follow standard Kibble Zurek (KZ) scaling, the anomalous boundary dynamics is unique to topological criticality, and its explanation goes beyond the traditional KZ mechanism. To elucidate the unified origin of this anomaly, we further study the dynamics of defect production at topologically distinct QCPs in free-fermion models and demonstrate similar anomalous universal scaling exclusive to topological criticality. These findings establish the existence of anomalous dynamical scaling arising from the interplay between topology and driven dynamics, challenging standard paradigms of quantum critical dynamics.

arXiv:2512.15559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports of strong room-temperature photoluminescence in hexagonal diamond (2H) germanium stand in marked contrast to theoretical predictions of very weak band-edge optical transitions. Here we address radiative emission in 2H-Ge and related materials through a comprehensive investigation of their excitonic properties and radiative lifetimes, performing Bethe-Salpeter calculations on pristine and uniaxially strained 2H-Ge, 2H-Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ alloys with $x=\frac{1}{6},\,\frac{1}{4},\,\frac{1}{2}$, and wurtzite GaN as a reference. Pristine 2H-Ge features sizable exciton binding energies ($\sim\!30$ meV) but extremely small dipole moments, yielding radiative lifetimes above $10^{-4}$ s. Alloying with Si reduces the lifetime by nearly two orders of magnitude, whereas a 2% uniaxial strain along the $c$ axis induces a band crossover that strongly enhances the in-plane dipole moment of the lowest-energy exciton and drives the lifetime down to the nanosecond scale. Although strained 2H-Ge approaches the radiative efficiency of GaN, its much lower exciton energy prevents a full match. These results provide the missing excitonic description of 2H-Ge and 2H-Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$, demonstrating that, even when excitonic effects are fully accounted for, the strong photoluminescence reported experimentally cannot originate from the ideal crystal.

arXiv:2512.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fabricate (In,Ga)N pseudo-substrates with a total thickness of ~1 um grown on GaN templates using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. In a three-step process, we change growth conditions from N-rich to metal-rich in order to sequentially form a roughened GaN layer, relaxed (In,Ga)N nanostructures, and a coalesced, smooth (In,Ga)N layer. Samples are analyzed by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, as well as photo- and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Compared to a reference layer grown directly on GaN, the pseudo-substrate exhibits a higher In content (~0.3), strain relaxation degree (~80%), narrower photoluminescence linewidth, and larger area fraction of bright regions in cathodoluminescence maps, showing the benefits of the three-step growth protocol. This straightforward approach does not necessitate any ex-situ processing and could enable the scalable fabrication of (In,Ga)N pseudo-substrates for high-efficiency red-emitting (In,Ga)N devices.

arXiv:2512.15569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) to study the large-scale dynamical properties of Brownian particles with arbitrary pairwise interaction. By combining it with standard results of equilibrium statistical mechanics for the collective diffusion coefficient, the MFT gives access to the exact large-scale dynamical properties of the system, both in- and out-of-equilibrium. In particular, we obtain exact results for dynamical correlations between the density and the current of particles. For one-dimensional systems, this allows us to obtain a precise description of these correlations for emblematic models, such as the Calogero and Riesz gases, and for systems with nearest-neighbor interactions such as the Rouse chain of hardcore particles or the recently introduced model of tethered particles. Tracer diffusion with the single-file constraint (but for arbitrary pairwise interaction) is also studied. For higher-dimensional systems, we quantitatively characterize these dynamical correlations by relying on standard methods such as the virial expansion.

arXiv:2512.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of disordered nuclear spin ensembles are the subject of nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Due to the through-space long-range dipolar interaction generically many spins are involved in the time evolution, so that exact brute force calculations are impossible. The recently established spin dynamic mean-field theory (spinDMFT) represents an efficient and unbiased alternative to overcome this challenge. The approach only requires the dipolar couplings as input and the only prerequisite for its applicability is that each spin interacts with a large number of other spins. In this article, we show that spinDMFT can be used to describe spectral spin diffusion in static samples and to simulate zero-quantum line shapes which eluded an efficient quantitative simulation so far to the best of our knowledge. We perform benchmarks for two test substances that establish an excellent match with published experimental data. As spinDMFT combines low computational effort with high accuracy, we strongly suggest to use it for large-scale simulations of spin diffusion, which are important in various areas of magnetic resonance.

arXiv:2512.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At low temperature, the concentration of quasiparticles observed in superconducting circuits far exceeds the predictions of microscopic BCS theory at equilibrium. As a source of dissipation, these excess quasiparticles degrade the performance of various devices. Therefore, understanding their dynamics, especially their recombination into Cooper pairs, is an active topic of current research. In disordered superconductors, spatial fluctuations in the superconducting gap can trap quasiparticles and modify their eigenspectrum. Since this spectrum plays a key role in quasiparticle dynamics, it must be carefully investigated. To this end, we introduce a toy model of a single trap. Specifically, we consider a shallow disk-shaped gap variation in a clean superconductor. Using a semiclassical approximation, we demonstrate the existence of multiple bound states and give the dependence of their number on the size and depth of the gap suppression. Extending our analysis beyond the semiclassical regime, in dimensions larger than one, we observe an infinite number of bound states very close to the gap edge, even for an arbitrarily small trap. These results deepen our understanding of trapped quasiparticles and may have important implications for their recombination in disordered superconductors.

arXiv:2512.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the subsampling of the avalanches in the fiber bundle model of fracture. In cases where only a part of the system is observed for the micro-failure events, the recorded avalanche statistics gets distorted compared to the actual fracture events. We show that, particularly in the cases where the load redistribution is localized, this distortion is significant. Surprisingly, however, near an elastic failure regime, the distortion is minimized, suggesting a much reduced observational capacity could still represent the actual failure dynamics in the case of fracture of elastic solids.

arXiv:2512.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: R2In (R = rare earth) intermetallics exhibit unusual magnetic and magnetocaloric properties, driven by subtle electronic effects, lattice distortions, and spin-lattice coupling. Most of these binary compounds adopt the hexagonal Ni2In-type structure at room temperature, with Eu2In and Yb2In stabilizing in the orthorhombic Co2Si-type lattice. Lighter lanthanide compounds Eu2In, Nd2In, and Pr2In undergo first-order magnetic transitions with negligible hysteresis and minimal lattice volume change and exhibit giant cryogenic magnetocaloric effects, while heavy lanthanide R2In compounds including Gd2In show second-order transitions with moderate magnetocaloric effect. No lanthanide-based R2In compound exhibits symmetry-breaking structural transition, while Y2In transforms from hexagonal to orthorhombic structure near 250 K. Secondary low-temperature transitions, including spin reorientation or antiferromagnetic ordering, further enrich the magnetic phase landscape in these compounds. Integrating theoretical descriptors such as charge-induced strain and electronic structure provides predictive insight into phase stability and magnetocaloric performance, guiding the design of rare-earth intermetallics with tunable magnetic properties for cryogenic applications

arXiv:2512.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actin and myosin drive many instances of force generation, deformation, and shape change in cells, tissues, and organisms. In particular, cytoskeletal actomyosin is remarkable in its adaptive architecture, responding to a host of actin-binding proteins. Equally important, however, is actomyosin's interaction with its mechanical environment. Actomyosin contractility and environmental properties, such as geometry and stiffness, are inherently coupled. To understand this coupling, novel experimental techniques are needed. Here we describe methods to spatially control the anchoring of reconstituted contractile actomyosin networks to two, opposing surfaces ("transverse anchoring"). The two surfaces can be either rigid ("pinned contraction"), or one of the surfaces may be compliant ("coupled contraction"). We introduce compliance by manufacturing flexure hinges, and describe their calibration. Calibration permits a direct measurement of the contractile force and mechanical work that actomyosin exerts on the environment. The methods described here provide an avenue toward a more complete characterization of actomyosin's role as an actuator, an essential property in its context of driving deformation and shape change in living systems.

arXiv:2512.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic octupole (MO) currents have recently attracted significant attention as a driving force for the Neel vector dynamics in d-wave altermagnets, a new class of antiferromagnets that exhibit nonrelativistic spin-split band structures. From a symmetry perspective, the MO includes an axial-dipole component analogous to that of the spin, making it essential to clarify how MO currents differ from spin currents. We here investigate the correspondence between MO conductivities and electronic multipoles, which provide a unified and powerful framework for symmetry analysis. We derive the multipole representation of the rank-five MO conductivity tensor and classify its symmetry-allowed components for all crystallographic point groups, in direct comparison with spin conductivity. We show that time-reversal-even electric-type multipoles give rise to the dissipationless MO current, whereas time-reversal-odd magnetic-type multipoles generate dissipative MO current under an applied electric field. Complementing this macroscopic analysis, the linear-response calculations for a microscopic tight-binding model demonstrate how MO conductivities are activated by symmetry lowering, exemplified by the symmetry reduction from Oh to Th. Our results elucidate the symmetry distinctions between MO currents and spin currents, and provide insights into their experimental identification.

arXiv:2512.15623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics offers a powerful route to manipulate material properties. However, it is unclear whether and how quantized fields affect crystals periodicity. Here, we extend Bloch's theorem to crystals under the strong light-matter coupling, showing that polariton quasiparticles preserve lattice periodicity. We formulate a general framework to incorporate the effect of multimode cavity fields in a simple and tractable way. We find that the additional modes contribute to the system's energy by small modifications that become noticeable only at low frequencies. Within the single-photon approximation the multimode contribution manifests as a spatially uniform effective field in the crystal's plane. This provides a formal justification for the single-mode and long-wavelength approximations commonly used in molecular polaritonics. This work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework that clarifies how polaritonic states in crystalline solids should be described.

Abstract: Making solution-cast organic solar cells industrially available generally comes at the cost of significant performance losses compared to device prototypes manufactured under laboratory conditions. Adjusting solvent evaporation kinetics is postulated to recover efficiency. Yet, a comprehensive characterization of their effect, independently of other property-defining parameters, is lacking. Thus, the present objective is to isolate the influence of the solvent drying rate on solution-deposited organic active layer nanomorphologies and performances. To this end, a specially designed gas quenching technique is employed to fabricate PM6:Y6 donor-acceptor films under systematic variations of evaporation conditions. Using an extensive investigation protocol that combines insights from numerical simulations and experimental measurements, process-structure-performance relationships are unraveled. It is found that higher drying rates imply finer and more dispersed nanomorphologies with increased fractions of amorphous material. This enhances electric charge generation, thereby improving short-circuit current density and overall cell performance. The open-circuit voltage is also boosted under accelerated evaporation due to changes in the aggregation mode of the Y6 small molecule that induce higher effective bandgaps. The results demonstrate that the developed gas-quenching technique is a valuable tool for optimizing the performance of upscaled organic photovoltaics, as it is readily compatible with high-throughput equipment, such as roll-to-roll coating machines.

arXiv:2512.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the design and implementation of a high-flux, high-efficiency magneto-infrared spectroscopy system optimized for broadband measurements in high magnetic fields. The setup integrates a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, a 12 T cryogen-free superconducting magnet, precision-polished and gold-plated light tubes, custom-designed reflective focusing modules for Faraday and Voigt geometries, and an external multi-detector chamber with motorized selection. Optical throughput is maximized by reducing light tube loss from 65.5%/m to 22.0%/m via abrasive flow and mechanical polishing followed by gold electroplating, and by adopting a single-on-axis parabolic-mirror Faraday module that increases the effective numerical aperture from 0.14 to 0.36, enhancing collection efficiency by nearly an order of magnitude. An eight-position motorized sample stage and fully automated control over magnetic field, temperature, optical path, and detector choice enable high-throughput measurements without repeated warm-ups. The optimized configuration achieves a root-mean-square noise level of 0.0061% in a 2-minute integration for a 40% reflectivity sample, corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 16000. System capabilities are demonstrated by resolving weak replica bands in EuCd2As2 and faint Landau level transitions in LaAlSi.

Abstract: We explore the use of the nested sampling technique to sample the configuration space of non-spherical hard particles. We employ the technique on the hard dumbbell system consisting of two hard spheres connected by a rigid bond, and investigate the phase stability across a wide pressure range and for bond lengths from completely overlapping to tangential hard spheres. Nested sampling recovers all previously identified features of the phase diagram and identifies a family of new packing variants. The fluid phase, plastic crystal, close packed solid phases and aperiodic crystal are all sampled, and the transition points between these are mapped. Our results show good agreement with predictions made by existing equations of state, and former Monte Carlo simulations. Nested sampling also identified a close packed structure with Pnma symmetry which has not previously been considered.

Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n < 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.

Abstract: Single crystal spinel CoFe$_2$O$_4$ exhibits the largest room-temperature saturation magnetostriction among non-rare-earth compounds and a high Curie temperature ($T_c \sim 780$ K), properties that are critical to a wide range of industrial and medical applications. Neutron spectroscopy reveals a large band splitting ($\sim$ 60 meV) between two ferrimagnetic magnon branches, which is driven by site mixing between Co$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ cations, and a significantly weaker magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($\sim$ 3 meV). Central to this behavior is the competition between extremely large mismatched molecular fields on the tetrahedral $A$-site and octahedral $B$-site sublattices and the single-ion anisotropy on the $B$-site. This creates a strong energetic anisotropy that locks the magnetic moment within each structural domain in place. As a result of these differing energy scales, switching structural domains is energetically favored over a global spin reorientation under applied magnetic fields, and this is what amplifies the magnetostrictive nature of CoFe$_2$O$_4$.

By investigating the formation of long, isolated stripes, we offer a perspective complementary to typical finite-doping phase diagrams. We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side. We find good agreement with established results, suggesting that the spread of filling fractions observed in the literature is governed by the physics of a single stripe. Taking a microscopic look at stripe formation, we reveal two separate regimes - a high-filling regime captured by a simplified squeezed-space model and a low-filling regime characterized by the structure of individual pairs of dopants. Thereby, we trace back the phenomenology of the striped phase to its microscopic constituents and highlight the different challenges for observing the two regimes in quantum simulation experiments.

Abstract: Quantum many-body dynamics generate nonclassical correlations naturally described by quantum resource theories. Quantum magic resources (or nonstabilizerness) capture deviation from classically simulable stabilizer states, while coherence and fermionic non-Gaussianity measure departure from the computational basis and from fermionic Gaussian states, respectively. We track these resources in a subsystem of a one-dimensional qubit chain evolved by random brickwall circuits. For resource-generating gates, evolution from low-resource states exhibits a universal rise-peak-fall behavior, with the peak time scaling logarithmically with subsystem size and the resource eventually decaying as the subsystem approaches a maximally mixed state. Circuits whose gates do not create the resource but entangle neighboring qubits, give rise to a ballistic spreading of quantum resource initially confined to a region of the initial state. Our results give a unified picture of spatiotemporal resource dynamics in local circuits and a baseline for more structured quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: We explore the information-theoretic phases of monitored quantum circuits subject to dynamics that conserves both charge and dipole moment, as well as measurements of the local charge density. Explicitly, both charge and dipole-moment conservation are strong symmetries, but under the dynamics they can be spontaneously broken to weak symmetries: this spontaneous symmetry breaking has an information-theoretic interpretation in terms of whether one can learn global charges from local measurements. We find a rich phase diagram: in one spatial dimension, charge is always easy to learn, while dipole moment can be either easy or hard. In two dimensions, we find three phases: for frequent measurements, both charge and dipole moment are easy to learn; as the measurement rate is decreased, first dipole moment and then charge become hard. In two dimensions, the low-measurement phase is an exotic critical phase with anisotropic spacetime scaling, analogous to a smectic liquid crystal.

arXiv:2512.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fermion sign problem poses a formidable challenge to the use of Monte Carlo methods for lattice gauge theories with dynamical fermionic matter fields. A meron cluster algorithm recently formulated for gauge fields represented as spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum links coupled to a single flavour of staggered fermions samples only two of the exponentially many Gauss law (GL) sectors at low temperatures, making it possible to simulate either of those two GL sectors at zero temperature in polynomial time. In this article, we analytically identify GL sectors which can be simulated without encountering the fermion sign problem in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and cluster Monte Carlo methods, we further explore the nature of phases in the GL sectors dominating at zero temperature. The vacuum states lie in sectors which satisfy a staggered Gauss law, in contrast to the zero GL sector familiar in particle physics. Moreover, we prove that while the ground state GL sectors do not suffer from the fermion sign problem, the usual zero-charge GL sector (often considered the physical sector) does. We outline the role of the magnetic energy in causing transitions between GL sectors. We expect our results to be valid for truncated Kogut-Susskind gauge theories, beyond quantum link models.

Abstract: In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era, noise is widely regarded as the primary obstacle to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, certain stages of the quantum computing pipeline can, in fact, benefit from this noise. In this work, we exploit the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis to show that noise generically accelerates a fundamental task in quantum computing -- the preparation of Gibbs states. We demonstrate this behavior using classical and quantum simulations with Haar-random and phase-flip noise, respectively, on a spin-1/2 chain with a local Hamiltonian. Our non-integrable model sees ~3.5x faster thermalization in the presence of noise, while our integrable model, which would not otherwise thermalize, reaches a thermal state due to noise. Since certifying a local Gibbs state is relatively easy on a quantum computer, our approach provides a new practical solution to a key problem in quantum computing. More broadly, these results establish a new paradigm in which noise can be harnessed on quantum computers, enabling practical advantages before the years of fault-tolerance.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as a versatile and powerful platform for quantum technologies, offering atomic-scale control, strong quantum confinement, and seamless integration into heterogeneous device architectures. Their reduced dimensionality enables unique quantum phenomena, including optically addressable spin defects, tunable single-photon emitters, low-dimensional magnetism, gate-controlled superconductivity, and correlated states in Moir\'e superlattices. This Roadmap provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress and future directions in exploiting 2D materials for quantum sensing, computation, communication, and simulation. We survey advances spanning spin defects and quantum sensing, quantum emitters and nonlinear photonics, computational theory and data-driven discovery of quantum defects, spintronic and magnonic devices, cavity-engineered quantum materials, superconducting and hybrid quantum circuits, quantum dots, Moir\'e quantum simulators, and quantum communication platforms. Across these themes, we identify common challenges in defect control, coherence preservation, interfacial engineering, and scalable integration, alongside emerging opportunities driven by machine$-$learning$-$assisted design and integrated experiment$-$theory feedback loops. By connecting microscopic quantum states to mesoscopic excitations and macroscopic device architectures, this Roadmap outlines a materials-centric framework for integrating coherent quantum functionalities and positions 2D materials as foundational building blocks for next-generation quantum technologies.

arXiv:2512.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for exactly solvable models is an evergreen topic in theoretical physics. In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices. For even larger graphs, we propose a specific family, termed descendants of ``$(0,2)$-graphs'', as promising candidates that may violate the conjecture above. Our work can serve as a guideline to identify new exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models in the future.

Abstract: Transport and localization in isolated quantum systems are typically attributed to spatially-extended disorder, leaving the influence of a few controllable defects largely unexplored despite their relevance to engineered quantum platforms. We introduce an analytic framework showing how a single defect profoundly reshapes wave-function spreading on a finite isolated and periodic tight-binding lattice. Adapting the defect technique from classical random-walk studies, we obtain exact time-resolved site-occupation probabilities and several observables of interest. Even one defect induces striking nonlinear and nonlocal effects, including non-monotonic suppression of transport, enhanced localization at distant sites, and strong sensitivity to the initial particle position at long times. These results demonstrate that minimal perturbations can generate unexpected long-time transport signatures, establishing a microscopic defect-driven mechanism of quantum localization.

Abstract: Understanding relaxation in isolated quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge. Recently, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, has attracted considerable attention and has been extensively studied in systems with global symmetries. Here, we study the QME in gauge theories with massive local gauge symmetries. In the lattice Schwinger model, we demonstrate that the gauge structure of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is entirely determined by the initial state and remain unchanged during the time evolution. We then investigate whether gauge symmetry can be dynamically restored following a symmetric quench. Analytical and numerical results show that when the Maxwell term is zero, gauge symmetry restoration fails due to the emergence of a peculiar conservation law. However, for any finite Maxwell term, subsystem gauge symmetry is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Based on these results, we systematically construct a families of initial states exhibiting the QME. We further explore the QME in the quantum link model-a truncated lattice Schwinger model, which has been realized in experiments. Moreover, we propose an experimentally accessible order parameter that correctly captures the QME. Our work demonstrates the generality of the quantum Mpemba effect even in the local gauge symmetries, and are directly relevant to ongoing quantum simulation experiments of gauge theories.

Abstract: Modeling plasmonic catalysis by applying femtosecond laser pulses of high intensity ($10^{13}-10^{15}$ W cm$^{-2}$), although justified by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) time-scale limitations, can lead to a dissociation mechanism that is completely unrelated to the plasmon excitation created under low-intensity continuous light in experiments (on the order of 1 W cm$^{-2}$). In this study, we examine the dissociation of H$_2$ on a large octahedral Ag nanoshell under varying field intensity, frequency, and duration, and we explore the possibility of identifying optimal modeling conditions accessible with current TDDFT simulations. We show that using this large nanoshell that consists in the outer layer of the Ag$_{231}$ cluster, it is still possible to disentangle the role of the plasmon from strong-field effects at applied field intensities as high as $(2-8) \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. In particular, although strong-field effects are always present at these intensities, we find that the excited plasmon dominates the dissociation process at the lowest applied intensity of $2 \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, at the highest intensity, at which strong-field effects become dominant, the plasmon contributes to accelerating the dissociation of the molecule. Overall, our simulations pave the way to bridge the intensity gap between TDDFT modeling and experiments in plasmonic catalysis.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the decoherence of qubit due to its coupling to a Hermitian or a non-Hermitian bath within the pure dephasing spin-boson model. First, using this model, we analytically establish the previously anticipated similarity between the non-equilibrium and the equilibrium correlation functions $P_x(t)$ and $C_x(t)$. Then, in the short/long time asymptotic behaviors of $P_x(t)$, we find singular dependence on $A$ (coupling strength) and $s$ (bath exponent) at their integer values. Finally, we find that the non-Hermitian bath tends to suppress the decoherence of qubit for all values of $A$ and $s$, in contrast to the conclusion of Dey et al. . Our results show the potential of non-Hermitian environment engineering in suppressing the decoherence of qubit.

Abstract: This paper investigates wave-packet dynamics in non-Hermitian lattice systems and reveals a surprising phenomenon: The simultaneous propagation of two distinct wavefronts, one traveling at the non-Hermitian velocity and the other at the Hermitian velocity. We show that this dual-front behavior arises naturally in systems governed by a pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Using the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model as our primary example, we demonstrate that this coexistence is essential for understanding a wide array of unconventional dynamical effects, including abrupt ``non-Hermitian reflections'', sudden shifts of Gaussian wave-packets, and disorder-induced emergent packets seeded by the small initial tails. We present analytic predictions that closely match numerical simulations. These results may offer new insight into the topology of non-Hermitian systems and point toward measurable experimental consequences.

Abstract: Scalable photonic quantum information technologies require a platform combining quantum light sources, waveguides, and detectors on a single chip. Here, we introduce a van der Waals platform comprising strain-engineered bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, integrated on multimode WS$_2$ waveguides with optimized grating couplers, enabling efficient on-chip quantum light sources. The emitters exhibit bright, highly polarized emission that couples efficiently into WS$_2$ waveguides. Under resonant p-shell excitation, we observe high-purity, waveguide-coupled single-photon emission, measured using both an off-chip Hanbury Brown-Twiss configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.003^{+0.030}_{-0.003}$) and an on-chip configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.076\pm0.023$). For a single output, the out-coupled single-photon count rate at the first lens reaches approximately 320 kHz under continuous-wave p-shell excitation, corresponding to an estimated waveguide-coupled rate of 1.7 MHz. These results demonstrate an efficient, integrated single-photon source and establish a pathway toward scalable photonic quantum information processing centered around nanoengineered van der Waals materials.

Abstract: The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) converts transmembrane ion flux into directed mechanical rotation, driving bacterial motility. Despite extensive study, the frictional forces and energetics governing its torque generation remain poorly understood. Here, we combine single-molecule rotation measurements with stochastic thermodynamics to quantitatively estimate its effective torque, viscous drag and activation energy barriers. We present three complementary methods based on solutions to the Smoluchowski equation for overdamped diffusion in a tilted periodic potential, which use as input the steady-state angular velocity and rotational diffusion data from individual \textit{E. coli} motors spanning different dynamical regimes. Crucially, these three methods require neither active external torque control, nor prior knowledge of the system's viscous drag or the motor's torque output. The first method assumes as input a model-dependent sinusoidal potential (single Fourier mode), albeit with unknown periodicity, yielding closed-form results in the low- and high-tilt limits, whereas the last two methods use a full Fourier-based reconstruction to output the now model-independent potential landscape. These approaches yield consistent estimates of the potential periodicity ($\approx$ 26-fold symmetry), energy barrier height ($\approx 2\!-\!4 k_{\rm B}T$), and internal friction coefficient ($\approx 0.1$ pN nm s rad$^{-2}$). Our results reveal that the BFM's torque-velocity relationship deviates significantly from the linear approximation near the critical tilt, where angular diffusion is maximized. More broadly, our framework provides a coherent strategy for reconstructing nanoscale energy landscapes from single-molecule data and is generalizable to other stepping molecular motors operating in cyclic conditions.

Abstract: Random matrix theory has played an important role in various areas of pure mathematics, mathematical physics, and machine learning. From a practical perspective of data science, input data are usually normalized prior to processing. Thus, this study investigates the statistical properties of min-max normalized eigenvalues in random matrices. Previously, the effective distribution for such normalized eigenvalues has been proposed. In this study, we apply it to evaluate a scaling law of the cumulative distribution. Furthermore, we derive the residual error that arises during matrix factorization of random matrices. We conducted numerical experiments to verify these theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Polariton condensation is a potential system state for performing analog computations, given that it exhibits quantum behavior at macroscopic scales readily probed with low-cost optical methods. Current methods of fabricating devices in polariton microcavities largely involve patterning the devices via e-beam lithography before the cavity is completed, which offers less flexibility in device creation and reduces the maximum possible refractive index contrast. Moreover, the momentum and spatial distributions of the condensate are highly dependent on the host platform, and it has been difficult to preserve the desired behavior when modifying a given cavity. Here we introduce a method that addresses both of these challenges with the creation of polaritonic circuits of arbitrary forms etched via Focused Ion Beam into an organic microcavity based on Rhodamine 3B Perchlorate within a Small Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices complex. We demonstrate room temperature condensation and propagation of polaritons in rectangular and trapezoidal waveguides by analyzing spatial and angle-resolved photoluminescence. We also discuss the blue-shifting and non-zero momentum of the condensate and show that it is strongly confined up to several higher energy levels. As an example, we report the spatial profiles of condensation in custom devices, such as a ring waveguide, a Y-splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This work represents a first step towards the realization of more complex, fully integrated, coherent polaritonic circuits operating at room temperature.

Abstract: The advent of nonlinear X-ray processes like sum-frequency generation and four-wave mixing raises the possibility of non-linear X-ray imaging, combining the high-resolution and elemental specificity of X-ray imaging with the state selectivity and sensitivity of non-linear optical imaging. While scanning imaging methods may be feasible, for linear X-ray processes coherent diffractive imaging has emerged as a key approach, enabling lensless reconstruction of nanoscale structure and dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this work, we propose a coherent diffractive approach to imaging using X-ray nonlinear processes, introducing an analysis method to isolate the nonlinear component from the overall diffraction pattern by leveraging the property of mutual incoherence between different wavelengths. For examples such as sum-frequency generation in ferroelectrics, this method reveals both domain structure and orientation through the retrieved amplitude and phase of the nonlinear signal. We discuss the feasibility of the proposed method in the presence of experimental noise, most relevantly shot noise. This analysis method is applicable in both static and dynamic imaging, offering a pathway beyond traditional spectroscopy toward XUV/X-ray coherent imaging of spatio-temporal dynamics in quantum materials and biological systems.

Abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in terahertz (THz) metamaterials relies on the coherent coupling between a radiative (bright) mode and a subradiant (dark) mode. Understanding the dynamic interplay between the bright and dark modes holds the key to manipulate the mutual interference and hence the transparency. Here, we use nonlinear 2D-THz spectroscopy to scrutinize the dynamics through nonlinearities of the EIT-like phenomenon in a metamaterial platform that comprises of two coupled resonators. From the temporal profiles of the nonlinear pump-probe and photon-echo signals, we found that the bright mode relaxation time is almost twice the time for the coherent exchange of energy between the two coupled resonators. The multi-peak nature of photon-echo signal and the corresponding temporal signatures further provides a direct visualization of the interference between the dressed states that drives the transparency window in our THz metamaterial. A time-resolved density matrix model accurately describes the observed features, including the cross-peak behavior and the temporal dynamics, establishing the coherent mode coupling as the origin of the transparency window.

Abstract: Photonics can offer a hardware-native route for machine learning (ML). However, efficient deployment of photonics-enhanced ML requires hybrid workflows that integrate optical processing with conventional CPU/GPU based neural network architectures. Here, we propose such a workflow that combines photonic positional embeddings (PEs) with advanced graph ML models. We introduce a photonics-based method that augments graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with PEs derived from light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices whose couplings match the input graph. We simulate propagation and readout to obtain internode intensity correlation matrices, which are used as PEs in GCNs to provide global structural information. Evaluated on Long Range Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, the method outperforms baseline GCNs with Laplacian based PEs, achieving $6.3\%$ lower mean absolute error for regression and $2.3\%$ higher average precision for classification tasks using a two-layer GCN as a baseline. When implemented in high repetition rate photonic hardware, correlation measurements can enable fast feature generation by bypassing digital simulation of PEs. Our results show that photonic PEs improve GCN performance and support optical acceleration of graph ML.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific "superintelligence". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.

Abstract: By means of the variational method and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the existence of stable 3D nonlinear modes, viz. vortex ``bullets'', in the form of pulsed beams carrying orbital angular momentum, that can self-trap in a 2D waveguiding structure. Despite the attractive self-interaction, which is necessary for producing the bullets (bright solitons), and which readily leads to the collapse in the 3D setting as well as to spontaneous splitting of vortex modes, we find a critical value of the trapping depth securing the stabilization of the vortex bullets. We identify experimental conditions for the creation of these topological modes in the context of coherent optical and matter waves. Collisions between the bullets moving in the unconfined direction are found to be elastic. These findings contribute to the understanding of self-trapping in nonlinear multidimensional systems and suggest new possibilities for the stabilization and control of 3D topological solitons.

Abstract: We propose an extension of the phenomenological Maffettone-Minale (MM) model (P.L. Maffettone and M. Minale, J. Non-Newton. Fluid Mech. 78, 227-241 (1998)) to describe the time-dependent deformation of a droplet with interfacial viscosity in a shear flow. The droplet, characterised by surface tension $\sigma$, is spherical at rest with radius $R$ and deforms into an ellipsoidal shape under a shear flow of rate $G$, described by a symmetric second-order morphological tensor $\boldsymbol{S}$. In addition to surface tension, the extended MM (EMM) model incorporates interfacial shear and dilatational viscosities, $\mu_s$ and $\mu_d$, through the corresponding Boussinesq numbers $\mbox{Bq}_s=\mu_s/\mu R$ and $\mbox{Bq}_d=\mu_d/\mu R$, where $\mu$ is the bulk viscosity. A central goal of this work is to quantify the parameter range over which the EMM model provides a realistic description of droplet deformation, as a function of the capillary number Ca$=\mu R G/\sigma$ and the Boussinesq numbers. To this end, model predictions are systematically compared with fully resolved numerical simulations.

We herein overcome this limitation using a tunable macroscopic platform for non-equilibrium physics: millimetric spheres bound by capillary attractions at the fluid interface and driven out of equilibrium by a field of supercritical Faraday waves. The external driving induces correlated fluctuations in the particle trajectories, which in turn excite structural rearrangements between distinct metastable cluster topologies. By tracking all microstate transitions experimentally, we directly measure a non-zero entropy production rate reflecting broken detailed balance and quantifying the system's departure from equilibrium. The measured stochastic dynamics are in quantitative agreement with a many-body active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, thus establishing a bridge to a wider class of athermal, self-propelled systems at the microscale. These results invite parallel studies of non-equilibrium self-assembly kinetics using active colloids or passive particles immersed in bacterial baths whose dynamics and irreversibility are likewise governed by correlated active forces and tunable inter-particle interactions.

Abstract: Tailored optical excitations can steer a system along non-equilibrium pathways to metastable states with specific structural or electronic properties. The light-induced hidden state of 1T-TaS$_{2}$, with its strongly enhanced conductivity and exceptionally long lifetime, represents a unique model system for studying the ultrafast switching of correlated electronic states. We use surface-sensitive electron diffraction in combination with a femtosecond optical quench to reveal the coexistence of both charge-density-wave (CDW) 2D chiralities as a structural characteristic of the hidden state, corresponding to coexisting ferro-rotational CDW states. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations of interfaces between opposite CDW 2D chiralities predict a higher-level, fractal-type moir'{e} superstructure with a kagome band structure near the Fermi energy. More broadly, these findings suggest that heterochiral interfaces in CDW systems provide an additional structural degree of freedom, expanding the possibilities for electronic control via twist-angle engineering.

Abstract: This work rigorously establishes a universal lower bound $z\ge2$ for the dynamical exponent in frustration-free quantum many-body systems whose ground states exhibit power-law decaying correlations. The derivation relies on the Gosset-Huang inequality, providing a unified framework applicable across various lattice structures and spatial dimensions, independent of specific boundary conditions. Remarkably, our result can be applied to prove new bounds for dynamics of classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we utilize a well-established mapping from the time evolution of local Markov processes with detailed balance to that of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians, known as Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians. This proves $z \ge 2$ for such Markov processes, which is an improvement over existing bounds. Beyond these applications, the quantum analysis of the $z\ge2$ bound is further broadened to include systems exhibiting hidden correlations, which may not be evident from purely local operators.

Abstract: Correlated materials are known to display qualitatively distinct emergent behaviors at low energy. Conveniently, upon absorbing rapid quantum fluctuations, these rich low-energy behaviors can always be effectively described by dressed particles with fully quantized charge, spin, and orbital structure. Such a powerful and simple description is, however, difficult to access through bare particles used in most many-body computations, especially when fluctuations are strong such as in $4d$ and $5d$ compounds. To decipher the dominant quantized structure, we propose an easy-to-implement `interaction annealing' approach that utilizes suppressed charge fluctuation through enhancing ionic charging energy. We establish its theoretical foundation using an exactly treated two-site Hubbard model as a generic example. We then demonstrate its applications with more affordable density functional calculations to a representative $3d$ Mott insulator La${_2}$CuO${_4}$ and a highly fluctuating $5d$ semi-metal WTe${_2}$. In the latter, it reveals an emergent local electronic structure that makes possible an unprecedented explanation of several experimental observations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in studying competing local electronic structures in functional materials.

Abstract: Electrochemical reduction is a promising way to make use of CO$_2$ as feedstock for generating renewable fuel and valuable chemicals. Several metals can be used in the electrocatalyst to generate CO and formic acid but hydrogen formation is an unwanted side reaction that can even be dominant. The lack of selectivity is in general a significant problem, but silver-based electrocatalysts have been shown to be highly selective for CO with over over 90% faradaic efficiency when the applied voltage is below -1 V vs. RHE. Hydrogen formation is then insignificant and little formate is formed even though it is thermodynamically favored. We present calculations of the activation free energy for the various elementary steps as a function of applied voltage at the three low index facets, Ag(111), Ag(100) and Ag(110), as well as experimental measurements on polycrystalline electrodes, to identify the reason for this high selectivity. The formation of formic acid is suppressed because of the low coverage of adsorbed hydrogen and kinetic hindrance to the formation of the HCOO* intermediate, while *COOH, a key intermediate in CO formation, is thermodynamically unstable until the applied voltage reaches -1 V vs. RHE, at which point the kinetics for its formation are more favorable than for hydrogen. The calculated results are consistent with experimental measurements carried out for acidic conditions and provide an atomic scale insight into the high CO selectivity of silver-based electrocatalysts.

Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) functionalized with covalent defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials with strong, tunable photoluminescence and demonstrated single photon emission (SPE). Here, we investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. Experimentally, it has been found that when the SWCNT is exposed to sodium dithionite, the resulting compound displays a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of doping with covalent defects. We perform density functional theory calculations on the possible adsorbed compounds that may be the source of doping (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). We predict that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.8 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively, and introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV, consistent with measurements. In contrast, the larger compounds are found to be either unbound or weakly physisorbed with no appreciable impact on the electronic structure of the tube, indicating that they are unlikely to occur. Overall, our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.

Abstract: Local chemical ordering strongly influences the behavior of complex concentrated alloys, yet its characterization remains challenging due to the nanoscale dimensions and scattered spatial distribution of the ordered domains. Here, we study chemical ordering near grain boundaries, demonstrating they can act as microstructural anchor points that amplify chemical order and drive the formation of compositional nanopatterns. Atomistic simulations reveal the development of composition waves with ordering vectors normal to the boundary plane in two distinct material systems, CrCoNi and NbMoTaW. These waves manifest as periodic enrichment-depletion patterns that reflect the underlying chemical ordering tendencies of each system, but with amplified contrast that extends several nanometers into the grain interior before gradually decaying. By examining multiple grain boundary orientations and alloys, we show that both the interfacial segregation profile and the crystallographic terminating plane govern the extent and character of this amplification. This interplay between boundary-dictated directional ordering and the diffuse, untemplated chemical domain evolution within the grain advances our understanding of interface-mediated ordering phenomena and suggests new opportunities for experimentally detecting local chemical order in complex concentrated alloys.

Abstract: The goal of thermodynamic optimal control theory is to find protocols to change the state of a system from an initial to a desired final distribution, within a finite time, with the least possible expenditure of work. The optimal protocol is closely linked to the intrinsic dynamics of the system at hand. The fact that these dynamics can vary widely has made a general solution elusive. Recent years have seen great progress by recasting the question in terms of a quantity called total activity, i.e. the average number of jumps between states of the system, rather than the time that the operation is allowed to take. This perspective has allowed for general expressions for the minimal work as a function of the total activity, and the minimal total activity required for a given work. The expression for minimal total activity can be recast as an apparent minimal operation time or speed limit. However, it is unclear whether protocols optimized under a constrained activity actually require the lowest work input for a given operation time. In the context of bit reset, we show that directly minimizing work for a given operation time leads to protocols that require significantly less work to perform the operation than the activity-constrained protocol of the same duration. We show how the resulting protocols differ. One reason for the difference is the fact that the activity rate is not constant over the course of the protocol: it depends on both the transition rates and the distribution of the bit, both of which change during the copy operation. In the limit of long protocol duration, we find an expression for the difference between the resulting minimal work for both optimization schemes, for a general class of dynamics. The time-constrained approach always outperforms the activity-constrained approach for a given constrained duration, and the difference in work can be arbitrarily large.

Abstract: Harmonic Hall measurements were performed on a series of ferromagnetic metal/heavy metal (FM/HM) bilayers consisting of Permalloy (Py) as the FM and beta-Tungsten (W) as the HM, and the efficiencies of the two orthogonal components of the spin-orbit torque (SOT) were extracted. Two sets of Hall bar-shaped devices, differing in the aspect ratio of the voltage pickup line width and the current channel width, were studied. Within each set, the resistivity of the W layer was systematically varied over a wide range (approximately 150-1000 micro-Ohm-cm). To account for geometry-induced variations in current distribution, numerical simulations were performed, and a correction protocol was developed to normalize the torque efficiencies obtained from the conventional analysis. After applying the correction, the Slonczewski-like (anti-damping, in-plane) torque efficiency exhibited a consistent dependence on W resistivity across both device sets. In contrast, the field-like (out-of-plane) torque efficiency remained largely independent of W resistivity, reinforcing its interfacial character.

Abstract: Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory, we show that the recently observed ferromagnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ [Nat. Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for smaller twist angles. At larger twist angles, the system hosts a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. On the other hand, the layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Our results demonstrate that long-range exchange in a symmetry-unbroken parent state with strongly renormalized moir\'e bands provides a broadly applicable framework to understand itinerant magnetism in moir\'e TMDs.

Abstract: Magnetic effects originating from spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been attracting major attention. However, SOC contributions to the electron magnetic moment operator are conventionally disregarded. In this work, we analyze relativistic contributions to the latter operator, including those of the SOC-type: in vacuum, for the semiconductor 8 band Kane model, and for an arbitrary system with two spectral branches. In this endeavor, we introduce a notion of relativistic corrections to the operation $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $\boldsymbol B$ is an external magnetic field. We highlight the difference between the magnetic moment and $-\partial H/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $H$ is the system Hamiltonian. We suggest to call this difference the abnormal magnetic moment. We demonstrate that the conventional decomposition of the total magnetic moment into the spin and orbital parts becomes ambiguous when relativistic corrections are taken into account. The latter also jeopardize the "modern theory of orbital magnetization" in its standard formulation. We derive a linear response Kubo formula for the kinetic magnetoelectric effect projected to individual branches of a two branch system. This allows us, in particular, to identify a source of this effect that stems from noncommutation of the position and $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$ operators' components. This is an analog of the contribution to the Hall conductivity from noncommuting components of the position operator. We comment on the relation between such contributions and the Berry curvature theory. We also report several additional observations related to the electron magnetic moment operator in systems with SOC and other relativistic corrections.

Abstract: We suggest a method to compute approximations to temporal correlation functions of few-body observables in chaotic many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit based on the respective Lanczos coefficients. Given the knowledge of these Lanczos coefficients, the method is very cheap. Usually accuracy increases with more Lanczos coefficients taken into account, however, we numerically find and analytically argue that the convergence is rather quick, if the Lanczos coefficients exhibit a smoothly increasing structure. For pertinent examples we compare with data from dynamical typicality computations for large but finite systems and find good agreement if few Lanczos coefficients are taken into account. From the method it is evident that in these cases the correlation functions are well described by a low number of damped oscillations.

Abstract: Unconventional superconductors have specific signatures in their magnetic properties, such as intrinsic magnetization at interfaces and around defects and fractional and multiquanta vortices, with much attention focused on heavy fermion and high-$T_c$ superconductors. Here, we report the observation of highly anomalous magnetization in $\beta$-PdBi$_2$, a layered superconductor previously shown to exhibit a magnetic field-induced transition from s-wave to nodal p-wave superconductivity at a transition field $H^*\sim$0.1 T ($H_{C1}<H_{C2}$). This transition is driven by the coupling between spin-polarized electronic bands and the in-plane magnetic field. In the unconventional phase (above $H^*$) we observe three striking features: strictly linear and non-hysteretic dc magnetization, a sharp drop in the ac susceptibility when the field is applied parallel to the ab-plane, and a pronounced anisotropy in the magnetic response between parallel and perpendicular field orientations. We show that these features are directly correlated with the expected transition to the nodal p-wave state and propose that the unusual magnetization behavior can be explained by a transition from a conventional vortex lattice in the low-field s-wave phase to a domain structure corresponding to spatial phase separation into superconducting (p-wave) and normal domains above $H^*$. Our work identifies new experimental signatures of unconventional multiphase superconductivity, offering an insight into the magnetic-field response of nodal states.

Abstract: We develop a microscopic mean-field theory describing the coexistence of Bose-Einstein condensates of upper and lower polaritons (UP/LP) in a semiconductor microcavity. Incorporating interbranch scattering within a modified polariton Hamiltonian, we introduce a phenomenological population-split parameter $\alpha$ that quantifies the relative LP/UP occupations. At zero detuning, the critical temperature becomes independent of $\alpha$, converging to a single value that marks the balanced, resonant regime. Away from resonance, variations in $\alpha$ lead to distinctive and experimentally resolvable changes in both the sound velocity $c_s$ and critical temperature $T_c$, relative to the single-component (LP-only) condensate limit. The system under study consists of excitons confined in a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayer, particularly WSe$_2$ embedded within a planar optical microcavity of GaAs where they strongly couple to cavity photons. Our analysis focuses on monolayer WSe$_2$ embdedded in a GaAs microcavity. We present results for GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells embedded in a GaAs microcavity in the Appendix. While mean-field in scope, the framework provides analytic benchmarks and physical insight for future treatments that include dissipation and fluctuations in nonequilibrium polariton superfluids.

Abstract: Utilizing the hierarchy of correlations in the context of a Fermi-Hubbard model, we deduce the presence of quasi-particle bound states at the interface between a Mott insulator and a semiconductor, as well as within a semiconductor-Mott-semiconductor heterostructure forming a quantum well. In the case of the solitary interface, the existence of bound states necessitates the presence of an additional perturbation with a minimal strength depending on the spin background of the Mott insulator. Conversely, within the quantum well, this additional perturbation is still required to have bound states while standing-wave solutions even exist in its absence.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the machine learning of density functionals allows one to determine simultaneously the equilibrium chemical potential across simulation datasets of inhomogeneous classical fluids. Minimization of a loss function based on an Euler-Lagrange equation yields both the universal one-body direct correlation functional, which is represented locally by a neural network, as well as the system-specific unknown chemical potential values. The method can serve as an efficient alternative to conventional computational techniques of measuring the chemical potential. It also facilitates using canonical data from Brownian dynamics, molecular dynamics, or Monte Carlo simulations as a basis for constructing neural density functionals, which are fit for accurate multiscale prediction of soft matter systems in equilibrium.

Abstract: The presence of two types of holes, namely the Dirac holes and the massive holes, in a two-dimensional sample exposed to an external permanent magnetic field leads to the emergence of the temperature and magnetic field-dependent contribution to the resistivity due to their interactions. Taking a HgTe-based two-dimensional semimetal as a testbed, we develop a theoretical model describing the role of interactions between the degenerate massive and massless Dirac particles for the magnetoconductivity and resistivity in the presence of a classical magnetic field. If only the Dirac holes are present in the system, the magnetoconductivity acquires a finite interaction-induced contribution, which would vanish for the parabolic spectrum. It demonstrates $T^4\ln(1/T)$ behavior at low temperatures for short-range interhole interaction potential, and $T^2$-like behavior in the case of long-range interhole interaction potential. However, the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect are not affected by the Dirac holes interparticle correlations in the lowest order of interparticle interaction. In contrast to this, the presence of two types of holes provides a finite contribution to the magnetoconductivity, magnetoresistivity, and the classical Hall effect resistivity. The temperature behavior of the magnetoconductivity here is $\sim T^2$ in the case of the short-range constant interparticle interaction potential and $T^2\ln(1/T)$ for the bare unscreened Coulomb interaction. A classically strong magnetic field suppresses the interaction-induced corrections to magnetoresistivity of massless-massive hole gas mixture.

Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and the outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.

In this short note, we consider extensions of simple disordered kinetic glass models from statistical physics. These models have tunable correlations, are easy to sample, and can be solved exactly when the state space dimension is large. In particular, we give an expository derivation of the dynamical mean field theories that describe their asymptotic statistics. We therefore propose that they constitute an interesting set of toy models for autoregressive sequence generation, in which one might study learning dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature properties of a mobile impurity immersed in a bath of bosonic particles confined to a square lattice. We analyze the regimes of attractive and repulsive coupling between the impurity and the bath particles for different strengths of boson-boson interactions in the bath, using exact large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted by recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for the transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is found to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a hole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions. While the binding prevent the aforementioned use of the polaron mass ratio as an MI-SF transition probe, we show that it can be used instead as a probe of the binding itself. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark for comparing lattice Bose polaron theories and are relevant for experiments with cold atoms trapped in optical lattices, where the presence of a confining harmonic potential can be modeled by a slowly varying local chemical potential.

Abstract: The recently discovered trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has emerged as a promising platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity. However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional Hubbard model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions forming two-dimensional (2D) lattices provide a versatile platform for investigating phase transitions predicted by Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory. While 2D melting in skyrmion systems has been demonstrated, achieving controlled ordering in skyrmion lattices remains challenging due to pinning effects from a non-uniform energy landscape, which often results in polycrystalline structures. Skyrmions in thin films, however, offer thermal diffusion with high tunability and can be directly imaged via Kerr microscopy, enabling real-time observation of their dynamics. To regulate lattice order in such flexible systems, we introduce geometric confinements of varying shapes. Combining Kerr microscopy experiments with Thiele model simulations, we demonstrate that confinement geometry critically influences lattice order. Specifically, hexagonal confinements commensurate with the skyrmion lattice stabilize monodomain hexagonal ordering, while incommensurate geometries induce domain formation and reduce overall order. Understanding these boundary-driven effects is essential for advancing the study of 2D phase behavior and for the design of skyrmion-based spintronic applications, ranging from memory devices to unconventional computing architectures.

Abstract: The orbital Hall effect (OHE) has attracted significant attention for developing energy-efficient electronic devices. However, utilizing it in fast, low-power devices requires an enhanced understanding of underlying extrinsic and intrinsic contributions to OHE at timescales ranging from quasi-static to picoseconds. Here, we investigate OHE in light metal vanadium (V) using a combination of selected measurement schemes, spanning the full frequency range. We observe a negative damping-like torque efficiency from V, opposite to conventional theoretical predictions, with a magnitude that depends on the adjacent ferromagnet, a dependence that indicates orbital effects. These results, with consistent torque efficiencies across all frequencies, corroborate a negative and intrinsic OHE in V with a large effective orbital Hall conductivity of $-(1.44 \pm 0.34)\,\frac{\hbar}{2e}\,\times 10^{5}\,\Omega^{-1}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ and a long orbital diffusion length of $(15.0 \pm 2.5)\,\mathrm{nm}$. To explain the observed OHE, we develop a theoretical model incorporating both local and itinerant circulation contributions to OHE. The model agrees excellently with the experimental results, demonstrating that itinerant contributions are essential for a complete physical understanding of intrinsic OHE. Our consistent experimental and theoretical data highlight the importance of itinerant contributions governing the fundamental understanding of intrinsic OHE and the large effects found open pathways for energy-efficient orbitronic devices.

Abstract: We provide an exact evaluation of the out-of-time correlation (OTOC) functions for the localized $f$-particle states in the Falicov-Kimball model within dynamical mean-field theory. Different regimes of quantum chaos and quantum scrambling are distinguished by the winding numbers of the block Toeplitz matrices used in the calculation. The similarities of these fermionic OTOCs and their logarithmic derivatives for time evolution with the OTOCs for quantum spin models with disorder are also discussed.

Abstract: Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While the kagome and snub square lattices, the simplest members of the Archimedean lattice family, have been extensively investigated -- the former as a paradigmatic system for geometric frustration and nontrivial band topology, and the latter primarily as a quasicrystal approximant -- the broader family remains largely unexplored in terms of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic Python-based tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, modeled as two-dimensional carbon-based networks serving as a proof-of-principle system. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and give rise to quantized spin Hall currents.

Abstract: We investigate a simple fermionic system designed to detect an unknown hopping rate between two sites by analyzing current circulation. The system exploits geometric asymmetry and utilizes the connection between the additional energy degeneracy point (AEDP) and current circulation for precise parameter detection. In the low-temperature, low-bias regime, with baths chemical potentials aligned near the degenerate energy, we find that a balanced Wheatstone bridge condition emerges when the direction of current circulation reverses, providing a direct means to determine the unknown hopping strength. We further examine the impact of environmental interactions, demonstrating that the device remains functional under moderately strong dephasing and particle losses, though extreme environmental effects eventually degrade performance. Extending the analysis to general operating conditions, we show that the device continues to function effectively at higher voltages and temperatures. Finally, an analysis of the quantum Fisher information qualitatively supports our findings, revealing a sharp increase in the coherence contribution and a corresponding decrease in the population contribution near the AEDP. Our results highlight geometric asymmetry as a robust and practical tool for quantum metrology.

Abstract: Achieving precise control of ultracold atomic gases requires a detailed understanding of atom loss mechanisms. Motivated by the anomalous three-body decay in a three-component Fermi gas reported in Ref. [1], this work investigates mechanisms that possibly contribute to the observed loss. The three-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic representation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is obtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate coefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength where the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the threshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally averaged $\langle K_3 \rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence. Because the experiment is performed in the degenerate regime, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ also explicitly depends on the per-spin densities through the per-spin Fermi energies $E_{F}^{(i)}\propto n_i^{2/3}$. As the gas is diluted and degeneracy is reduced, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ approaches the non-degenerate value and becomes a function of temperature only. Channel-resolved branching ratios and cross sections are folded into a Monte Carlo cascade simulation of secondary collisions and trap escape. The analysis indicates that typical three-body recombination events remove fewer than three atoms on average, and that the atom losses are primarily due to the ejection of secondary collision products, rather than the initial three-body recombination products. Therefore, a significant fraction of the released binding energy remains in the trapped ensemble as kinetic energy. Retained energy drives evaporative loss, offering a plausible, partial explanation for the anomalous decay.

Abstract: We investigate interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains with two- and three-site unit cells using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. By selecting appropriate filling fractions and sweeping across interaction strength \( J_z \) and dimerization \( \delta \), we map out their phase diagrams and identify transition lines via entanglement entropy and magnetization measurements. In the two-site model, we observe the emergence of an interaction-induced antiferromagnetic intermediate phase between the topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, as well as a critical region at negative \( J_z \) with suppressed magnetization and finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy. In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering in both positive and negative \( J_z \) regimes. We further examine the response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model, zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a finite interaction strength. However, in the three-site model, where the edge states reside at finite energy, this protection breaks down. Despite this, the edge-localized nature of these states survives in the form of polarized modes whose spatial profiles reflect the non-interacting limit.

Abstract: We present an SU(2)xU(1) genralization of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the spin triplet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also describe the physics of the spin triplet magnon spintronics, where the SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon plays an important role. The theory is made of the massive photon, massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary charge current and the spin current of the magnons), and the non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter physics.

Abstract: Topological phenomena in quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing attention, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, a general framework for identifying such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we propose a universal fingerprint for detecting nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems protected by global on-site symmetries. Specifically, we analytically establish an exact relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems.

Abstract: Experimental and theoretical studies of nanoscale hafnia-zirconia physical properties are hot topics in fundamental and applied science. However, magnetic and charge transport properties of HfxZr1-xO2-y nanoparticles are very poorly studied theoretically and experimentally. In this work we observed a superparamagnetic-like and superparaelectric-like response of ultra-small (5 - 10 nm in size) HfxZr1-xO2-y nanoparticles prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The EPR spectra of HfxZr1-xO2-y nanopowders reveal the presence of paramagnetic defect centers, which are the oxygen vacancies with one captured electron, and hafnium or zirconium ions that changed their oxidation state from +4 to +3 due to the presence of oxygen vacancies. The Raman spectra indicate the decisive role of surface defects, presumably oxygen vacancies, for all studied x = 1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 and significant degree "y" of oxygen deficiency. At the same time elemental analysis did not reveal any noticeable concentration of magnetic impurities in the HfxZr1-xO2-y nanopowders, and the X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the dominant presence (from 87 to 96 wt. %) of the orthorhombic phase. Due to the flexo-electro-chemical strains, presumably induced by the oxygen vacancies and their complexes accumulated near their surface, the ultra-small HfxZr1-xO2-y nanoparticles reveal superparaelectric-like behavior, posistor-like behavior and significant values of accumulated charge. We observed that the static relative dielectric permittivity of the HfxZr1-xO2-y nanopowders overcomes 107 and related the colossal values with the superparaelectric state of the nanoparticles cores induced by the flexo-electro-chemical strains.

Abstract: We develop an extension of the fermionic functional renormalization group for systems where strong correlations give rise to projected Hilbert spaces. We use our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by Luttinger's theorem.

Abstract: The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.

Abstract: The energy losses of energetic ions in materials depend on both nuclear and electronic interactions. In channeling geometries, the stopping effect of these interactions can be highly reduced, resulting in deeper ion penetration. Comprehensive, trajectory-dependent models for ion-material interactions are therefore crucial for the accurate prediction of ion range profiles. We present the implementation of a recent electron density-dependent energy-loss model in the efficient molecular dynamics-based MDRANGE code. The model captures \textit{ab initio} electron dynamics using a parametrized ion energy loss function, based on calculations for explicit trajectories using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate the efficient simulation of trajectory-dependent ion range profiles with this comprehensive model for electronic energy losses. Our results indicate that accurate trajectory-dependent ion range profiles can be simulated using well-fitted parametrizations of this model. This method offers a unique tool for validation of the fitted energy-loss functions using energetic ion ranges, which can be measured experimentally but are beyond the capability of full MD simulations due to the computational expense.

Abstract: The control of localized magnetic domains at the nanoscale holds great promise for next-generation spintronic applications. Colloidal transition metal dichalcogenides nanostructures are experimentally accessible and chemically tunable platforms for spintronics, deserving dedicated research to assess their potential. Here, we investigate from first principles free-standing triangular MoS2 nanoflakes with sulfur-terminated, hydrogen-passivated edges, to probe intrinsic spin behavior at varying side lengths. We find a critical edge length of approximately 1.5 nm separating nonmagnetic nanoflakes from larger ones with a magnetic ground state emerging from several, energetically competing spin configurations. In these systems, the magnetic activity is not uniformly distributed along the edges but localized on specific "magnetic islands" around molybdenum edge atoms. The localization of magnetic moments is robust even in non-equilateral nanoflake geometries, highlighting their intrinsic stability regardless of the (high) symmetry of the hosting structure. These findings establish that the S-terminated, H-passivated triangular MoS2 nanoflakes are a stable and experimentally accessible platform via colloidal synthesis for low-dimensional, next-generation spintronic devices.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum processors have potential to scale to modular quantum computers, in which qubit registers are coupled by quantum links, enabling high connectivity and space for control circuitry. Individual spin-qubit registers have progressed to two-dimensional systems and execution of small quantum algorithms. Separately, high-fidelity spin shuttling has been demonstrated in linear channels defined by individual gate electrodes. Here, we realize the first shared-control shuttling link integrated between distant qubit registers to demonstrate quantum entanglement in a basic modular quantum processor based on hole spin qubits in germanium. We develop a protocol to compensate for spin-orbit-induced rotations during qubit transfer, allowing for shuttling between qubit registers separated by more than one micrometer in approximately a hundred nanoseconds. Combining local qubit operation with coherent shuttling, we generate Bell states formed by spins residing in separate registers. Characterizing them using quantum state tomography, we demonstrate entanglement between spin qubits in distant registers.

Abstract: Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached. However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine, such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate transmission level.

Abstract: Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.

Abstract: We consider a toy model of two kinetically coupled stochastic oscillators whose dynamics is described as a Markov jump process among $N$ discrete phase states. For large $N$, it maps onto the deterministic two-oscillator Kuramoto model of synchronization. Despite its simplicity, we postulate its relevance for understanding more complex and realistic oscillator systems. In the thermodynamic limit, the model exhibits a continuous nonequilibrium phase transition between the unsynchronized and synchronized states. We show that this transition is not governed by any extremum dissipation principle -- depending on system parameters, synchronization may either reduce or enhance the dissipation. Close to the phase transition, we observe a divergent behavior of fluctuations and responses with $N$ and characterize their universal scaling behavior. In particular, the covariances of the oscillator phases and the local entropy productions are shown to diverge towards $-\infty$, a phenomenon that has not been reported before. Finally, we study the behavior of information-theoretic quantities, demonstrating that mutual information and information flow between oscillators display different scaling with $N$ in synchronized and unsynchronized states, and thus can act as order parameters of synchronization.

Abstract: The low-temperature properties of a 2D Bose fluid of charged particles interacting through a 1/r potential, moving in the presence of a uniform neutralizing background, is studied by Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We make use of the Modified Periodic Coulomb potential formalism to account for the long-range character of the interaction, and explore a range of density corresponding to average interparticle separation $1 \le r_s\le 80$. We report numerical results based on simulations of system comprising up to 2304 particles. We find a superfluid ground state for $r_s$ as large as 70, i.e., significantly above the most recent numerical estimate of the Wigner crystallization threshold, which we estimate at $r_W \approx 71$. Furthermore, no thermally re-entrant crystalline phase nor any evidence of metastable bubbles is observed near the transition, in contrast with a previous theoretical study in which quantum statistics was neglected. The computed superfluid transition temperature depends remarkably weakly on density.

Abstract: (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ alloys are non-degenerate topological insulators (TIs) whose Dirac point (DP) can be tuned within the bulk bandgap by varying the composition, effectively reducing bulk conduction while allowing surface carrier conduction. Magnetotransport measurements of a series of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films indicate electron-dominated conduction, with weak anti-localization attributed to topological surface states (TSSs). Due to the similarity of phase coherence lengths and twin boundary spacings ($\sim$100 nm), we consider the role of twin boundaries as additional conducting paths. Density functional theory calculations reveal an enhanced density of states near the Fermi level at $60^\circ$ twin boundaries, with 2D carrier concentration in excess of $3 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, an analysis of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity yields an upper bound of $7.3 \times 10^{-4}$ S for twin boundary conductivity, resulting in a carrier mobility as high as $142$ cm$^2$/(V$\cdot$s). We discuss the role of twin boundaries in facilitating a transition from a massive Dirac cone dispersion to gapless, topologically protected surface states. Understanding the role of twin boundaries on carrier conduction in non-degenerate TIs is critical for the development of novel TI-based electronic devices.

Abstract: Generating magnon frequency combs (MFCs) with tunable spacing via a single-frequency driving is crucial for practical applications but it typically relies on complex spin textures like skyrmions or vortices. Here, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate MFC generation in geometrically curved ferromagnetic thin films using single-frequency microwave excitation, without topological spin textures. We first show that the curvature transforms the planar ferromagnetic resonance into a localized, redshifted magnon bound state, which, under non-resonant driving, activates sequential three-magnon scattering processes assisted by the curvature-driven effective anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. It finally produces equally spaced, robust frequency combs with spacing exactly set by the bound mode frequency. Moreover, we find that the curvature gradient at the hybrid interface mimics an analog event horizon, with the bound state's redshift resembling gravitational effects in black hole physics. Micromagnetic simulations confirm these curvature-driven nonlinear phenomenon, unveiling a novel geometric strategy for controlling magnon interactions and advancing compact magnonic devices.

Abstract: Chiral orbital current (COC) plays a crucial role in governing the magnetization and transport behaviour in the layered ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6. Here, we observe that the topological Hall effect (THE), typically attributed to Berry curvature from chiral spin textures, originates from COC, which produces an emergent magnetic field for conduction electrons due to its real-space orbital textures. We find that the THE signal strengthens as we move down from bulk to nanoflakes, but tends to disappear with increasing current, along with the disappearance of the COC state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and the observed THE, suggesting that large Berry curvature and topological transport can arise purely from orbital degrees of freedom, providing a new platform for engineering dissipationless transport in 2D magnets.

Abstract: We study a model for lithium (Li) electrodeposition on Li-metal electrodes that leads to dendritic pattern formation. The model comprises of a system of three coupled PDEs, taking the form of an Allen--Cahn equation, a Nernst--Planck equation and a Poisson equation. We prove existence of a weak solution and stability results for this system and present numerical simulations resulting from a finite element approximation of the system, which illustrate the dendritic nature of solutions to the model.

Abstract: The theory of quantum thermodynamics investigates how the concepts of heat, work, and temperature can be carried over to the quantum realm, where fluctuations and randomness are fundamentally unavoidable. These lecture notes provide an introduction to the thermodynamics of small quantum systems. It is illustrated how the laws of thermodynamics emerge from quantum theory and how open quantum systems can be modeled by Markovian master equations. Quantum systems that are designed to perform a certain task, such as cooling or generating entanglement are considered. Finally, the effect of fluctuations on the thermodynamic description is discussed.

Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly.

Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis for digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate on nearest neighbours, many circuits require nonlocal connectivity and necessitate some form of quantum information transport. Yet, connecting distant nodes of a quantum processor still remains challenging, particularly for neutral atoms in optical lattices. Here, we create singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven atomic singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.

Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.

arXiv:2504.02937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics generically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian operator becomes non-diagonalizable. Steady states, i.e. zero-modes of Liouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go theorem excludes non-diagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate that the crucial issue of diverging timescales in dissipative state preparation is largely tantamount to an asymptotic approach towards the forbidden scenario of an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. With case studies ranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master equation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological phase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the problem at hand, and the finite size scaling towards the exceptional steady state, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Formally treating the weight $W$ of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter, we show that exceptional steady states at the physical value $W=1$ may be understood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.

arXiv:2504.10631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heat exchanged between an open quantum system and its environment exhibits fluctuations that carry crucial signatures of the underlying dynamics. Within the well-established two-point measurement scheme, we identify a 'heat operator,' whose moments with respect to the vacuum state of a thermofield-doubled Hilbert space correspond to the stochastic moments of the heat exchanged with a bath. This recasts heat statistics as a unitary time evolution problem, which we solve by combining chain-mapped reservoirs with tensor network propagation. In a multi-bath setup all total and bath-resolved heat moments then follow from a single pure state evolution. We employ this approach to compute transient and steady state heat fluctuations in Ohmic spin-boson models in and out of equilibrium, accessing the challenging low temperature and long memory time regimes of the environment. In the nonequilibrium case, we show a crossover in the Fano factor from super-Poissonian to nearly Poissonian statistics under strong coupling asymmetry, corresponding to thermal rectification behavior. The method applies to noninteracting (bosonic or fermionic) nonequilibrium environments with arbitrary spectral densities, offering a powerful, non-perturbative framework for understanding heat transfer in open quantum systems.

Bruno Scheihing-Hitschfeld, N\'estor Sep\'ulveda

arXiv:2504.19057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By means of Trotter's formula, we show that transition amplitudes between a class of generalized coherent states in the Rabi model can be understood in terms of a certain Ising model featuring long-range interactions beyond nearest neighbors in its thermodynamic limit. Specifically, we relate the transition amplitudes in the Rabi model to a sum over binary variables of the form of a partition function of an Ising model with a number of spin sites equal to the number of steps in Trotter's formula applied to the real-time evolution of the Rabi model. From this, we show that a perturbative expansion in the energy splitting of the two-level subsystem in the Rabi model is equivalent to an expansion in the number of spin domains in the Ising model. We conclude by discussing how calculations in one model give nontrivial information about the other model, and vice versa, as well as applications and generalizations this correspondence may find.

arXiv:2505.11071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic kick drives are ubiquitous in digital quantum control, computation, and simulation, and are instrumental in studies of chaos and thermalization for their efficient representation through discrete gates. However, in the commonly used Fourier basis, kick drives lead to poor convergence of physical quantities. Instead, here we use the Walsh basis of periodic square-wave functions to describe the physics of periodic kick drives. In the strongly kicked regime, we find that it recovers Floquet dynamics of single- and many-body systems more accurately than the Fourier basis, due to the shape of the system's response in time. To understand this behavior, we derive an extended Sambe space formulation and an inverse-frequency expansion in the Walsh basis. We explain the enhanced performance within the framework of single-particle localization on the frequency lattice, where localization is correlated with small truncation errors. We show that strong hybridization between states of the kicked system and Walsh modes gives rise to Walsh polaritons that can be studied on digital quantum simulators. Our work lays the foundations of Walsh-Floquet theory, which is naturally implementable on digital quantum devices and suited to Floquet state manipulation using discrete gates.

arXiv:2506.11982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.

Abstract: Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, III-nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved through improvements in electrical efficiency in devices containing V-defects. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to reduced barrier heights for charge injection in thinned, low-Indium quantum wells parallel to semi-polar V-defect facets. To test this proposition, a novel approach in which the tip of a scanning tunneling luminescence microscope as a local hole injector, is used to map the optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-defects with nanoscale spatial resolution. A 1 V reduction in the forward bias necessary for current injection at V-defect rims is observed. This, combined with the observation of small (~10 meV) blue shifts in the locally emitted electroluminescence, unambiguously confirms the charge injection mechanism.

Abstract: The information scrambling phenomena in an open quantum system modeled by Ising spin chains coupled to Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) baths are observed via an interferometric method for obtaining out-of-time-ordered correlators ($\mathcal{F}-$OTOC). We also use an anisotropic bath connecting to a system of tilted field Ising spin chain in order to confirm that such situations are suitable for the emergence of ballistic spreading of information manifested in the light cones in the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC profiles. Bipartite OTOC is also calculated for a bipartite open system, and its behavior is compared with that of the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC of a two-spin open system to get a picture of what these measures reveal about the nature of scrambling in different parameter regimes. Additionally, the presence of distinct phases in the LMG model motivated an independent analysis of its scrambling properties, where $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC diagnostics revealed that quantum chaos emerges exclusively in the symmetry-broken phase.

arXiv:2508.03045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of photonic and phononic bandgaps within a single scalable architecture promises transformative advances in optomechanical and acousto-optic devices. Here, we design and simulate a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice in silicon with air-gap holes that transition smoothly from circular to triangular via tuneable geometrical parameters including air-gap hole radius (R) and tether length (l). By independently varying these two parameters, we systematically explore diverse honeycomb lattice geometries and their bandgap properties. This transformation from circular to triangular air-gap holes enables suppression of both electromagnetic and elastic wave modes through Bragg scattering and symmetry modulation. We demonstrate that systematic variation of R and l allows tuning of photonic and phononic bandgaps upto 49.7% and 24.8% respectively. This possibility of geometrically tuning bandgaps provide a strong foundation for applications in Bragg filters, sensors etc. without the need for complex defects or exotic materials.

arXiv:2508.18233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study flows generated within a two-dimensional corner by the chemical activity of the confining boundaries. Catalytic reactions at the surfaces induce diffusioosmotic motion of the viscous fluid throughout the domain. The presence of chemically active sectors can give rise to steady eddies reminiscent of classical Moffatt vortices, which are mechanically induced in similar confined geometries. In our approach, an exact analytical solution of the diffusion problem in a wedge geometry is derived and coupled to the diffusioosmotic slip-velocity formulation, yielding the stream function of associated Stokes flow. In selected limiting cases, simple closed-form expressions provide clear physical insight into the underlying mechanisms. Our results open new perspectives for the design of microscale mixing strategies in dead-end pores and cornered microfluidic channels, and offer benchmarks for numerical simulations of confined (diffusio)osmotic systems.

arXiv:2510.17404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractonic phases of matter, a class of states in which collective excitations with constrained mobility exist, were originally discovered in the study of quantum error-correcting codes in solvable lattice spin models such as Haah's code and the X-cube model. Recently, they have also drawn the attention of the high-energy physics community due to the UV/IR mixing that arises when coarse-graining these lattice models. In this work, we consider a (3+1)-dimensional holographic model of fractonic solids and investigate the low-energy collective dynamics systematically. By computing the quasinormal modes of black holes, we obtain all the hydrodynamic excitations on the boundary, including two acoustic phonons, a longitudinal diffusive mode, and a subdiffusive collective mode with the dispersion $\omega \sim-ik^4$. In addition, it is found that the latter remains gapless when translational symmetry is explicitly broken. These results suggest that the subdiffusive mode is inherently protected by the crystal-dipole symmetry in solids and is qualitatively unaffected by broken spacetime symmetries.

Kanka Ghosh, Andreas M. Menzel

arXiv:2511.00135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a hole is introduced into an elastic material, it will usually act to reduce the overall mechanical stiffness. A general ambition is to investigate whether a stiff shell around the hole can act to maintain the overall mechanical properties. We consider this effect from a macroscopic continuum perspective down to atomistic scales. First, we focus on the basic continuum example situation of an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly elastic material loaded uniformly under compressive plane strain for low concentrations of holes. As we demonstrate, the thickness of the shell can be adjusted in a way to maintain the overall stiffness of the system. We derive a corresponding mathematical expression for the thickness of the shell that conceals the hole. Thus, one can work with given materials to mask the presence of the holes simply by adjusting the thickness of the surrounding shells, with no need to change the materials. Our predictions from linear elasticity continuum theory are extended to atomistic levels using molecular dynamics simulations of a model Lennard-Jones solid. These extensions attest the robustness of our predictions down to atomistic scales. Thus, they open a straightforward possibility to adjust the strategy of mechanical cloaking via atomistic manipulations. From both perspectives, the underlying concept is important in the context of light-weight construction.

arXiv:2511.00877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a spacelike singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.

arXiv:2511.22930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs) of superconducting qubits (SCQs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing (FTSQC). Nonetheless, quantitative experimental estimation on QPG rates has remained vague. Here, we investigate QPG using strongly driven SCQs, reaching qubit drive amplitudes up to $2\pi\times$300 GHz by applying intense drive fields through the readout resonators. The resonator nonlinear responses enable quantification of the energy loss at SCQs, including the contribution from QPG. Surprisingly, the estimated total energy loss rates are far lower than those expected by the Floquet-Markov formalism with QPG as the sole loss mechanism. Meanwhile, calculations that incorporate high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) in the QPG conductance at approximately 17-20 GHz effectively explain the experimental observations. These results suggest limitations in either the QPG conductance model or the Markovian treatment of the QPG processes. Both possibilities possess crucial implications for handling QPG problems toward FTSQC and for a more deeper understanding of Josephson junctions.

arXiv:2512.09317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how network structure constrains and enables information processing is a central problem in the statistical mechanics of interacting systems. Here we study random networks across the structural percolation transition and analyze how connectivity governs realizable input-output transformations under cascade dynamics. Using Erdos-Renyi networks as a minimal ensemble, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree. We find that the emergence of the giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow, quantified by transfer entropy, extends beyond local neighborhoods. We term this coincidence of structural, functional, and informational transitions functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the percolation threshold. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality may provide a general organizing principle of information processing capacity in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.
