Abstract: A very recent report claims that ambient-pressure high-temperature ($T_c$) superconductivity was found in boron-doped three-dimensional networks of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Here, we systematically study the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of one-dimensional (1D) (3,0) CNT under ambient pressure. Our results show that the EPC constant $\lambda$ of the undoped 1D (3,0) CNT is 0.70, and reduces to 0.44 after 1.3 holes/cell doping. Further calculations show that the undoped (3,0) CNT is a two-gap superconductor with a superconducting $T_c$ $\sim$ 33 K under ambient pressure. Additionally, we identify three characteristic phonon modes with strong EPC, establishing that the pristine (3,0) CNT is a high-$T_c$ superconducting unit, and further suggest that searching for those superconducting units with strong EPC phonon mode would be an effective way to discover high-$T_c$ phonon-mediated superconductors. Our study not only provide a crucial and timely theoretical reference for the recent report regarding superconducting CNTs, but also uncover that the pristine (3,0) CNT hosts the highest record of superconducting $T_c$ among the elemental superconductors under ambient pressure.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise as a powerful tool for scientific literature exploration. However, their effectiveness in providing scientifically accurate and comprehensive answers to complex questions within specialized domains remains an active area of research. Using the field of high-temperature cuprates as an exemplar, we evaluate the ability of LLM systems to understand the literature at the level of an expert. We construct an expert-curated database of 1,726 scientific papers that covers the history of the field, and a set of 67 expert-formulated questions that probe deep understanding of the literature. We then evaluate six different LLM-based systems for answering these questions, including both commercially available closed models and a custom retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system capable of retrieving images alongside text. Experts then evaluate the answers of these systems against a rubric that assesses balanced perspectives, factual comprehensiveness, succinctness, and evidentiary support. Among the six systems two using RAG on curated literature outperformed existing closed models across key metrics, particularly in providing comprehensive and well-supported answers. We discuss promising aspects of LLM performances as well as critical short-comings of all the models. The set of expert-formulated questions and the rubric will be valuable for assessing expert level performance of LLM based reasoning systems.

Abstract: In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.

arXiv:2511.03790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the longitudinal collective mode in an unconventional superconductor. For concreteness, we assume that the superconductor is described by a $d$-wave order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry. After the superconductor has been suddenly subjected to a perturbation at time $t=0$, the order parameter exhibits a peculiar oscillatory behavior, with the amplitude of the oscillations slowly decaying with time in a power-law fashion. Assuming that the initial perturbation is weak, we use a formalism based on quasi-classical approach to superconductivity to determine both the frequency of the oscillations as well as how fast these oscillations decay with time by evaluating the time dependence of the pairing susceptibility. We find that the frequency of the oscillations is given by twice the value of the pairing amplitude in the anti-nodal direction and its amplitude decays as $1/t^2$. The results are also verified by a direct calculation of the order parameter dynamics by numerically solving the equations of motion for the Anderson pseudospins.

arXiv:2511.03792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory for the spin fluctuation spectrum of the hole-doped cuprates in a ground state with period 4 unidirectional charge density wave (`stripe') order. Motivated by recent experimental evidence for a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal, we employ a theory of fermionic spinons which are confined with the onset of stripe order at low temperatures. The theory produces the `hourglass' spectrum near stripe-ordering wavevector observed by neutron scattering. Additional scattering from spinon continua and bound states appears at higher energies and elsewhere in the Brillouin zone, and could be observed by neutron or X-ray scattering.

arXiv:2511.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of the superconducting phase difference across a Josephson junction can be described within the resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson junction (RCSJ) model. Microscopic derivations of this model traditionally rely on the tunneling limit. Here, we present a derivation of a generalized version of the RCSJ model, which accounts for dissipative currents with nonlinear current-voltage characteristics as well as supercurrents with arbitrary current-phase relations. This requires a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem to describe the Langevin current, which we deduce along the lines of fluctuation theorems for mesoscopic conductors. Our work is motivated in particular by recent theories of the Josephson diode effect, which is not captured within the RCSJ model in the tunneling limit.

arXiv:2511.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of ceramics exhibiting bulk plasticity at room temperature has renewed interest in revisiting plastic deformation and dislocation-mediated mechanical and functional properties in these materials. In this work, a data-driven approach is employed to identify the key parameters governing room-temperature bulk plasticity in ceramics. The model integrates an existing dataset of 55 ceramic materials, 38 plastically deformable and 17 brittle, and achieves accurate classification of bulk plasticity. The analysis reveals several key parameters essential for predicting bulk plasticity: i) Poisson's ratio and Pugh's ratio as macroscopic indicators reflecting the balance between shear and volumetric deformation resistance, and ii) Burgers vector, crystal structure and melting temperature as crystallographic descriptors associated with lattice geometry, slip resistance and thermal stability, and iii) Bader charge as a microscopic measure of bonding character. Together, these parameters define a multiscale descriptor space linking intrinsic materials properties to bulk room-temperature plasticity in ceramics, bridging the gap between empirical ductility criteria and atomistic mechanisms of dislocation-mediated plasticity. While preliminary, this study provides the first systematic, data-driven mapping of the governing factors of ceramic plasticity. The resulting framework establishes a foundation for unifying experimental and computational studies through shared datasets and descriptors, fostering collective progress toward understanding and designing intrinsically ductile ceramics.

Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley

arXiv:2511.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Part I of this study, vibration assisted heat treatments of ZBLAN glass revealed irregular crystallization at higher vibration levels, attributed to intermittent loss of thermal contact between the sample and the inner silica ampoule wall. The present work (Part II) investigates this mechanism through finite element modeling (FEM) and experimental validation.COMSOL Multiphysics simulations incorporating conduction, radiation, and contact resistance confirm that intermittent contact markedly reduces heat transfer efficiency, lowering the sampletemperature. To mitigate this effect, the experimental setup was redesigned with a four-degree inclination to maintain stable contact during vibration. Subsequent experiments at vibration levels H3-H5 demonstrated uniform heating and consistent crystallization behavior.Comprehensive microscopic, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analyses revealed that even at subtle vibration levels (~50 Hz), partially crystallized ZBLAN transformed into well-developed crystalline structures near 360C. With increasing vibration amplitude, amorphous ZBLAN began forming incipient crystalline phases around 330C, and at higher frequencies (~100 Hz), partial crystallization initiated at approximately 350C. These results indicate that higher vibration frequencies accelerate nucleation, enhance heat transfer, and reduce the effective fiber-drawing temperature window by about 30C. Prolonged exposure above 330C under vibration promotes unwanted phase transitions, emphasizing the need for precise thermal and vibrational control. This study establishes a predictive framework for vibration-resistant ZBLAN processing applicable to both terrestrial and microgravity environments.

arXiv:2511.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the slot between parallel metal gates placed above two-dimensional electron system (2DES) forms a plasmonic cavity with unconventional mode quantization. The resonant plasmon modes are excited when the slot width $L$ and the plasmon wavelength $\lambda$ satisfy the condition $L = \lambda/8 +n \times \lambda/2$, where $n=0, 1, 2 \ldots$. The lowest resonance occurs at a surprisingly small cavity size, specifically one eighth of the plasmon wavelength, which contrasts with the conventional half-wavelength Fabry-Perot cavities in optics. This unique quantization rule arises from a non-trivial phase shift of $-\pi/4$ acquired by the 2D plasmon upon reflection from the edge of the gate. The slot plasmon modes exhibit weak decay into the gated 2DES region, with the decay rate being proportional to the square root of the separation between the gate and the 2DES. Absorption cross-section by such slots reaches $\sim 50$ % of the fundamental dipole limit without any matching strategies, and is facilitated by field enhancement at the metal edges.



[10]. [*Resolution of Loschmidts Paradox via Geometric Constraints on Information Accessibility*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03843 "Resolution of Loschmidts Paradox via Geometric Constraints on Information Accessibility")

Ira Wolfson

arXiv:2511.03843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve Loschmidt's paradox -- the apparent contradiction between time-reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible macroscopic evolution -- including the long-standing puzzle of the thermodynamic arrow of time. The resolution: entropy increases not because dynamics are asymmetric, but because information accessibility is geometrically bounded. For Hamiltonian systems (conservative dynamics), Lyapunov exponents come in positive-negative pairs ($\{\lambda_i, -\lambda_i\}$) due to symplectic structure. Under time reversal these pairs flip ($\lambda_i \to -\lambda_i$), but stable manifolds contract below quantum resolution $\lambda = \hbar/\sqrt{mk_BT}$, becoming physically indistinguishable. We always observe only unstable manifolds where trajectories diverge. Hence information loss proceeds at the same rate $h_{KS} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\text{all } i}|\lambda_i|$ in both time directions, resolving the arrow of time: ``forward'' simply means ``where we observe expansion,'' which is universal because stable manifolds always contract below measurability. Quantitatively, for N$_2$ gas at STP with conservative estimates ($h_{KS} \sim 10^{10}$ s$^{-1}$), time reversal at $t = 1$ nanosecond requires momentum precision $\sim 10^{-13}$ times quantum limits -- geometrically impossible. At macroscopic times, the precision requirement becomes $\sim 10^{-10^{10}}$ times quantum limits. This framework preserves microscopic time-reversal symmetry, requires no special initial conditions or Past Hypothesis, and extends to quantum systems (OTOCs) and black hole thermodynamics.

arXiv:2511.03853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even in the quantum limit, non-equilibrium quasiparticle (QP) populations induce QP poisoning that irreversibly relaxes the quantum state and significantly degrades the coherence of transmon qubits. A particularly detrimental yet previously unexplored mechanism arises from QP multiplication facilitated by vortex trapping in superconducting quantum circuits, where a high-energy QP relaxes by breaking additional Cooper pairs and amplifying the QP population due to the locally reduced excitation gap and enhanced quantum confinement within the vortex core. Here we directly resolve this elusive QP multiplication process by revealing vortex-controlled QP self-generation in a highly nonequilibrium regime preceding the phonon bottleneck of QP relaxation. At sufficiently low fluence, femtosecond-resolved magneto-reflection spectroscopy directly reveals a continuously increasing QP population that is strongly dependent on magnetic-field-tuned vortex density and absent at higher excitation fluences. Quantitative analysis of the emergent QP pre-bottleneck dynamics further reveals that, although the phonon population saturates within $\simeq$10~ps, both free and trapped QPs continue to grow in a self-sustained manner--hallmarks of the long-anticipated QP-vortex interactions in nonequilibrium superconductivity. We estimate a substantial increase of $\sim$34\% in QP density at vortex densities of $\sim$ 100 magnetic flux quanta per $\mathrm{\mu m^{2}}$. Our findings establish a powerful spectroscopic tool for uncovering QP multiplication and reveal vortex-assisted QP relaxation as a critical materials bottleneck whose mitigation will be essential for resolving QP poisoning and enhancing coherence in superconducting qubits.

arXiv:2511.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of memristor based neural networks trained with the hardware-friendly Manhattan update rule, focusing on the trade offs between learning performance and energy consumption. Using realistic models of potentiation/depression (P/D) curves, we evaluate the impact of nonlinearity (NLI), conductance range, and number of accessible levels on both a single perceptron (SP) and a deep neural network (DNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. Our results show that SPs tolerate P/D nonlinearity up to NLI $\leq 0.01$, while DNNs require stricter conditions of NLI $\leq$ 0.001 to preserve accuracy. Increasing the number of discrete conductance states improves convergence, effectively acting as a finer learning rate. We further propose a strategy where one memristor of each differential pair is fixed, reducing redundant memristor conductance updates. This approach lowers training energy by nearly 50% in DNN with little to no loss in accuracy. Our findings highlight the importance of device algorithm codesign in enabling scalable, low power neuromorphic hardware for edge AI applications.

Abstract: Inspired by nature, this study employs the Materials Genome Initiative to identify key components of HTSC superconductors. Integrating AI with high-throughput screening, we uncover crucial superconducting "genes". Through HTS techniques and advanced machine learning models, we demonstrate that Functional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ensure accurate extrapolation of potential compounds. Leveraging extensive datasets from the ICSD, the Materials Project and COD, our implemented HTS pipeline classifies superconductors, with CNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) models predicting Tc and their foundational elements. We address the scarcity of non-superconducting material data by compiling a dataset of 53,196 non-superconducting materials (DataG Non-Sc) and introduce a novel neural network architecture using Functional API for improved prediction, offering a powerful tool for future superconductor discovery. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of combining HTS with AI-driven models in advancing HTSC materials, highlighting Pu and H elements (with Tc nearly 100 K) as significant predictors of high-temperature superconductivity, suggesting their role as a crucial gene in these materials.

arXiv:2511.03884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructural pattern formation, such as dendrite growth, occurs widely in materials and energy systems, significantly influencing material properties and functional performance. While the phase-field method has emerged as a powerful computational tool for modeling microstructure dynamics, its high computational cost limits its integration into practical materials design workflows. Here, we introduce a machine-learning framework using autoregressive deep surrogates trained on short trajectories from quantitative phase-field simulations of alloy solidification in limited spatial domains. Once trained, these surrogates accurately predict dendritic evolution at scalable length and time scales, achieving a speed-up of more than two orders of magnitude. Demonstrations in isothermal growth and in directional solidification of a dilute Al-Cu alloy validate their ability to predict microstructure evolution. Quantitative comparisons with phase-field benchmarks further show excellent agreement in the tip-selection constant, morphological symmetry, and primary spacing evolution.

Abstract: Recent discoveries in semi-metallic multi-gap systems featuring band singularities have galvanized enormous interest in particular due to the emergence of non-Abelian braiding properties of band nodes. This previously uncharted set of topological phases necessitates novel approaches to probe them in laboratories, a pursuit that intricately relates to evaluating non-Abelian generalizations of the Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) that characterizes geometric responses. Here, we pioneer the direct measurement of the non-Abelian QGT. We achieve this by implementing a novel orbital-resolved polarimetry technique to probe the full Bloch Hamiltonian of a six-band two-dimensional (2D) synthetic lattice, which grants direct experimental access to non-Abelian quaternion charges, the Euler curvature, and the non-Abelian quantum metric associated with all bands. Quantum geometry has been highlighted to play a key role on macroscopic phenomena ranging from superconductivity in flat-bands, to optical responses, transport, metrology, and quantum Hall physics. Therefore, our work unlocks the experimental probing of a wide phenomenology of multi-gap systems, at the confluence of topology, geometry and non-Abelian physics.

arXiv:2511.03895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of active optical steering of structural phase transitions in solids. We demonstrate that existing reinforcement learning approaches can derive optimal time-dependent electric fields in optically-driven dissipative classical systems far beyond the harmonic regime, enabling the stabilization of non-thermal structural phases. Our approach relies on experimentally extractable metrics of the phase-space evolution and physically-interpretable Fourier Neural Network surrogates of the time-dependent electric field. Using first-principles simulations, we demonstrate the stabilization of a symmetric phase in bismuth through impulsive Raman scattering under continuous and pulsed light sources in the presence of dissipation. Importantly, the method is gradient-free, which enables optimization loops based solely on experimental data, such as the measures of half-periods of oscillations in transient spectroscopy. Our framework thus provides a practical route for controlling non-equilibrium structural dynamics with light, opening pathways to stabilize hidden and metastable phases in quantum materials.

arXiv:2511.03901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rigorous derivation of the matrix elements of the orbital magnetic moment (OMM) of Bloch states. Our calculations include the Berry connection term in the k-derivatives of Bloch states, which was omitted in previous works. The resulting formula for the OMM matrix elements applies to any non-degenerate Bloch states within Hilbert space. We identify two new contributions: the first restores gauge covariance for non-degenerate states, while the second, being itself gauge covariant, can provide significant quantitative corrections depending on the system under study. We examine their impact on the orbital Hall effect in two bilayer systems: a 2H transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer and a biased bilayer graphene. In both cases, these new terms reduce the orbital Hall conductivity plateau compared with results that neglect them, suggesting that multi-layered van der Waals materials may be particularly susceptible to the derived OMM corrections. Our findings may contribute to the formal understanding of electronic OMM transport and to the conceptual foundations of the emerging field of orbitronics.

Abstract: To enable lightweight and flexible solar cell applications it is imperative to develop direct bandgap absorber materials. Moreover, to enhance the potential sustainability impact of the technologies there is a drive to base the devices on earth-abundant and readily available elements. Herein, we report on the epitaxial growth of Zn3P2 nanowires using exclusively earth-abundant components, using Sn as the nanowire catalyst and Si (111) as the substrate. We observe that the nanowires exhibit a triangular cross section at lower temperatures, a pseudo-pentagonal cross section at intermediate temperatures, and a hexagonal cross section in a twin plane superlattice configuration at high temperatures and high V/II ratios. At low temperatures, the surface facets are constricted into a metastable configuration, yielding the triangular morphology due to the symmetry of the substrate, while intermediate temperatures facilitate the formation of a pseudo-pentagonal morphology with lower surface to volume ratio. The twin plane superlattice structure can only be observed at conditions that facilitate the incorporation of Sn into Zn3P2, which is needed to form heterotwins in the tetragonal structure, namely at high temperatures and high phosphine partial pressures. These findings show a clear pathway to use Zn3P2 nanowires in sustainable solar energy harvesting using exclusively earth-abundant components, as well as opening up a novel route of fabricating quantum wells inside nanowires using heterotwins.

Congzhe Yan, Jinyang Ni

arXiv:2511.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In altermagnets, magnons-the quanta of collective spin excitations-exhibit chiral splitting even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and external magnetic fields. Typically, this chiral splitting behavior can be well described by alternating isotropic spin exchanges (ISE) in the low-temperature regime; however, its dynamic behavior at a finite temperature remains unclear. In this study, we reveal that, when including magnon-magnon interactions, long range anisotropic spin exchange (ASE) can also induce chiral splitting of magnons at a finite temperature. Crucially, the chiral splitting induced by ASE competes with that arising from ISE, leading to a pronounced temperature dependent modulation of the altermagnetic chiral splitting. Moreover, this competition is intimately connected to spin fluctuations, and can reverse the spin current driven by the band splitting as temperature increases. Our work uncovers the intrinsic competition governing collective spin excitations in altermagnets, providing new insights into their finite-temperature dynamical behavior.

Abstract: Light polarization is one of the most fundamental features, equivalent to energy and coherence. Magnetism changes light polarization, and vice versa. The irradiation of intense circularly polarized femtosecond pules to magnetic materials can alter the magnetic orders and elementary excitations, particularly in the visible to infrared spectral regions. Furthermore, the recent development of x-ray free-electron laser enables the element-specific trace of the ultrafast dynamics with high time and spatial resolution. However, the light helicity of x-ray photons has not yet been used to control order parameters in condensed matter materials, not limited to such magnetic phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic magnetization reversal of a ferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt multilayer solely by irradiating femtosecond pulses of circularly polarized hard x-rays. The observed all-optical magnetization switching depends on the helicity of incident x-ray pulses and is strongly resonant with the photon energy at the Pt $L_3$ edge. These results originate in the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism of Pt, involving helicity-dependent excitation from the 2$p_{3/2}$ core level to the exchange-split 5$d$ valence states owing to the magnetic proximity effect with Co. These findings mark a new frontier for examining interactions between light and matter in the x-ray region.

Abstract: We analyze the thermal and electrical characteristics of the metasurface consisting of
  the coplanar interdigital array of the graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected by nanobridges (NBs). These nanobridges could be implemented using graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), single-wall semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or black-arsenic-phosphorus (b-AsP) nanostructures. The bias voltage applied between neighboring GMRs indices electron and hole two-dimensional systems in the GMRs and induces thermionic currents flowing through connecting NBs. The resulting self-heating increases thermionic currents providing an effective positive feadback between the carrier effective temperature and the injected currents. This mechanism may lead to thermal breakdown enabling threshold behavior of current-voltage characteristics and resulting in the S-shape of these characteristics. The devices based on the GMR/GNR, GMR/CNT, and GMR/AsP metasurface structures can be used as fast voltage-controlled current switches, sensors, thermal terahertz and infrared sources, and other devices.

Abstract: We report ARPES studies combined with DFT+DMFT calculations to confirm that the magnetic ordering vector transition from \textbf{Q}=(1/2,0,0) to \textbf{Q}=(1/3,0,0) in the metallic triangular antiferromagnets Co$_{1/3\pm\epsilon}$TaS$_2$ ($\epsilon\approx$0.007) is induced by the electronic structure change in the system. The ARPES-measured Fermi surface (FS) maps of Co$_{0.325}$TaS$_2$ show two hexagonal and one circular hole-like FSs around $\Gamma$, which matches well with the triple-\textbf{Q} state by taking into account the contribution of nesting vectors occurring between Co 3$d$ and Ta 5$d$ orbitals. In the case of Co$_{0.340}$TaS$_2$, a new electron pocket around K appears and the FS geometry changes as a result of the correlation effect of Co$_4$S$_{18}$ tripods forming in the system. The magnetic susceptibility calculations based on the DFT+DMFT band structure indicate that the most stable magnetic ordering vector changes to (1/3,0,0) from (1/2,0,0), which is very consistent with the magnetic phase transition around $x$=1/3 in Co$_{x}$TaS$_2$.

Abstract: Insulator-to-metal transition materials are highly sensitive to even minute deviations of stoichiometry, lattice defects, and disorder, which provides opportunities to engineer their electrical switching characteristics. Using V2O3 as a prototypical metal-insulator transition resistive switching material, we demonstrate that localized focused ion beam irradiation can induce stochastic oscillatory dynamics in simple two-terminal switching devices. After irradiating the material, we observed an unusual dynamic regime where the voltage induced metallic state momentarily collapses into an insulating state, which results in a rapid current flickering that is qualitatively different from the conventional current spiking in a Pearson-Anson type oscillatory circuit implemented using the pristine material. Furthermore, the current flickering timing in the irradiated devices becomes progressively more random and more sparse with increasing input voltage, resulting in nonlinear and nondeterministic oscillatory behavior. The irradiation also leads to a dramatic reduction in switching power required to induce the current oscillations. These results are elucidated through random resistor network simulations which indicate that a small number of local sites can control the electrical metal-insulator transition switching properties in large devices with high defect concentration. Our results show that selective focused ion beam irradiation provides exciting prospects for engineering and tuning novel stochastic behaviors in emergent technologies that rely on the intrinsic randomness of physical processes.

Abstract: Accurate determination of crystal structures is central to materials science, underpinning the understanding of composition-structure-property relationships and the discovery of new materials. Powder X-ray diffraction is a key technique in this pursuit due to its versatility and reliability. However, current analysis pipelines still rely heavily on expert knowledge and slow iterative fitting, limiting their scalability in high-throughput and autonomous settings. Here, we introduce a physics-guided contrastive learning framework termed as XCCP. It aligns powder diffraction patterns with candidate crystal structures in a shared embedding space to enable efficient structure retrieval and symmetry recognition. The XRD encoder employs a dual-expert design with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network projection head, one branch emphasizes low angle reflections reflecting long-range order, while the other captures dense high angle peaks shaped by symmetry. Coupled with a crystal graph encoder, contrastive pretraining yields physically grounded representations. XCCP demonstrates strong performance across tasks, with structure retrieval reaching 0.89 and space group identification attains 0.93 accuracy. The framework further generalizes to compositionally similar multi principal element alloys and demonstrates zero-shot transfer to experimental patterns. These results establish XCCP as a robust, interpretable, and scalable approach that offers a new paradigm for X-ray diffraction analysis. XCCP facilitates high-throughput screening, rapid structural validation and integration into autonomous laboratories.

Abstract: We numerically study the fast spatial transport of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using shortcuts-to-adiabaticity (STA) by counterdiabatic driving (CD). The trapping potential and the required auxiliary potential were simulated as painted potentials. We compared STA transport to transport that follows a constant-acceleration scheme (CA). Experimentally feasible values of trap depth and atom number were used in the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) simulations. Different transport times, trap depths, and trap lengths were investigated. In all simulations, there exists a minimum amount of time necessary for fast transport, which is consistent with previous results from quantum speed limit studies.

Abstract: Topological materials--including insulators (TIs) and semimetals (TSMs)--hold immense promise for quantum technologies, yet their discovery remains constrained by the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and the slow, resource-intensive nature of experimental synthesis. Here, we introduce TXL Fusion, a hybrid machine learning framework that integrates chemical heuristics, engineered physical descriptors, and large language model (LLM) embeddings to accelerate the discovery of topological materials. By incorporating features such as space group symmetry, valence electron configurations, and composition-derived metrics, TXL Fusion classifies materials across trivial, TSM, and TI categories with improved accuracy and generalization compared to conventional approaches. The framework successfully identified new candidates, with representative cases further validated through density functional theory (DFT), confirming its predictive robustness. By uniting data-driven learning with chemical intuition, TXL Fusion enables rapid and interpretable exploration of complex materials spaces, establishing a scalable paradigm for the intelligent discovery of next-generation topological and quantum materials.

Abstract: Leaves, i.e., vertices of degree one, can play a significant role in graph structure, especially in sparsely connected settings in which leaves often constitute the largest fraction of vertices. We consider a leaf-based counterpart of the degree, namely, the leaf degree -- the number of leaves a vertex is connected to -- and the associated leaf degree distribution, analogous to the degree distribution. We determine the leaf degree distribution of random recursive trees (RRTs) and trees grown via a leaf-based preferential attachment mechanism that we introduce. The RRT leaf degree distribution decays factorially, in contrast with its purely geometric degree distribution. In the one-parameter leaf-based growth model, each new vertex attaches to an existing vertex with rate $\ell$ + a, where $\ell$ is the leaf degree of the existing vertex, and a > 0. The leaf degree distribution has a powerlaw tail when 0 < a < 1 and an exponential tail (with algebraic prefactor) for a > 1. The critical case of a = 1 has a leaf degree distribution with stretched exponential tail. We compute a variety of additional characteristics in these models and conjecture asymptotic equivalence of degree and leaf degree powerlaw tail exponent in the scale free regime. We highlight several avenues of possible extension for future studies.

arXiv:2511.04101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $T=0$ phase diagrams of models of bilayers of $S=1/2$ square lattices antiferromagnets with SU(2) Heisenberg symmetry that have 2, 4, and 6 spin exchanges. We study two families of bilayer models with distinct internal symmetries and, hence, different phase diagram topologies. A traditional bilayer model in which the interlayer interaction is Heisenberg so that the two layers can exchange spin (and energy) with each other, making it possible to achieve a simple dimerized valence bond liquid-like state. The resulting phase diagram is rich with N\'eel, valence bond solid and simple dimer phases, and both first-order and continuous transitions, which we demonstrate are consistent with the conventional Landau theory of order parameters. In the second family of models in which the layers can exchange only energy but no spin (reminiscent of the Ashkin-Teller coupling), the simple dimer state cannot occur. The phase diagrams reveal a number of phase transitions that are accessed for the first time. We find that the phase transition between N\'eel and VBS is first order in both the spin-spin and energy-energy coupled models, although they have strikingly distinct finite-size scaling behavior and that the transition from VBS to dimer in the spin-spin coupling model deviates from the expected scenario of an XY model with dangerously irrelevant four-fold anisotropy.

arXiv:2511.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between altermagnetic band structures and electronic correlations by focusing on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic generalization of the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. We find that with increasing interaction, a many-body Lifshitz transition takes place when doubly occupied regions disappear from the Fermi surface and each momentum state becomes fully spin polarized. The spin susceptibility is directly evaluated from the Kubo formula in terms of many-body occupation probabilities. We find that the dynamical susceptibility, which possesses only transverse non-zero components for small wavevectors, develops a gap proportional to the interaction strength, and displays a sharp peak at a frequency increasing with the interaction. %with increasing frequency. Above the Lifshitz transition, this peak moves to the lower gap edge and becomes log-divergent. The signal intensity increases with the interaction up until the Lifshitz transition and saturates afterwards. The static susceptibility remains unaffected by the correlations and altermagnetism reduces the static transverse response.

arXiv:2511.04149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the temperature dependence of the crystal structure of quasi-one-dimensional monoclinic BaIrO$_3$ using X-ray diffraction. Diffraction patterns were measured across a temperature range from 13 K to 300 K, with 5-degree steps, and Rietveld refinements were performed to extract the relevant lattice parameters. The resulting cell volumes exhibit a significant deviation from the Debye model predictions for lattice-specific heat within a reasonable range of the Debye temperature, Gr{\"u}neisen parameter, and bulk modulus. This suggests an invar-like, unconventional thermal expansion behavior. The deviation begins near the weak ferromagnetic transition temperature, indicating a strong correlation with changes in the electronic and magnetic structure of monoclinic BaIrO$_3$.

arXiv:2511.04181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membraneless droplets or liquid condensates formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) play a pivotal role in cell biology and hold potential for biomedical engineering. While membraneless droplets are often studied in the context of interactions between passive components, it is increasingly recognized that active matter inclusions, such as molecular motors and catalytic enzymes in cells, play important roles in the formation, transport and interaction of membraneless droplets. Here we developed a bacteria-polymer active phase separation system to study the nonequilibrium effect of active matter inclusions on the LLPS dynamics. We found that the presence of bacterial active matter accelerated the initial condensation of phase-separated liquid droplets but subsequently arrested the droplet coarsening process, resulting in a stable suspension of membraneless active droplets packed with motile bacterial cells. The arrested phase separation of the bacterial active droplet system presumably arises from anti-phase entrainment of interface fluctuations between neighboring droplets, which reduces the frequency of inter-droplet contact and suppresses droplet coarsening. In addition, the active stresses generated by cells within the droplets give rise to an array of nonequilibrium phenomena, such as dominant long-wavelength fluctuations and enhanced droplet transport with short-term persistent motion due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Our study reveals a unique mechanism for arrested phase separation and long-term stability in membraneless droplet systems. The bacteria-polymer active phase separation system opens a new avenue for studying the dynamics of membraneless active droplets relevant to non-equilibrium LLPS in cells and in biomedical engineering applications.

arXiv:2511.04189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological tissues exhibit distinct mechanical and rheological behaviors during morphogenesis. While much is known about tissue phase transitions controlled by structural order and cell mechanics, key questions regarding how tissue-scale nematic order emerges from cell-scale processes and influences tissue rheology remain unclear. Here, we develop a minimal vertex model that incorporates a coupling between active forces generated by cytoskeletal fibers and their alignment with local elastic stress in solid epithelial tissues. We show that this feedback loop induces an isotropic--nematic transition, leading to an ordered solid state that exhibits soft elasticity. Further increasing activity drives collective self-yielding, leading to tissue flows that are correlated across the entire system. This remarkable state, that we dub plastic nematic solid, is uniquely suited to facilitate active tissue remodeling during morphogenesis. It fundamentally differs from the well-studied fluid regime where macroscopic elastic stresses vanish and the velocity correlation length remains finite, controlled by activity. Altogether, our results reveal a rich spectrum of tissue states jointly governed by activity and passive cell deformability, with important implications for understanding tissue mechanics and morphogenesis.

Abstract: Physical properties in the normal and superconducting (SC) state are investigated with $^{125}$Te-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in a quasicrystal $\mathrm{(Ta_{0.95}Cu_{0.05})_{1.6}Te}$, which was a recently discovered superconductor with the SC transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ = 0.94 K. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ shows a coherence peak just below $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, followed by an exponential decrease down to 0.1 K. The overall temperature dependence of $1/T_1$ is in good agreement with an $s$-wave SC model with a SC gap slightly smaller than the BCS value. However, the coherence peak is unusually small, which may be attributable to a reduced Bogoliubov peak theoretically predicted for quasicrystals. Furthermore, $^{125}$Te-NMR spectra show almost no broadening nor shift in the SC state, suggesting that an unusual SC state such as parity mixing might be realized in the Ta$_{1.6}$Te superconductor.

Abstract: Inspired by the brain, we present a physical alternative to traditional digital neural networks -- a microfluidic network in which nodes are connected by conical, electrolyte-filled channels acting as memristive iontronic synapses. Their electrical conductance responds not only to electrical signals, but also to chemical, mechanical, and geometric changes. Leveraging this multimodal responsiveness, we develop a training algorithm where learning is achieved by altering either the channel geometry or the applied stimuli. The network performs forward passes physically via ionic relaxation, while learning combines this physical evolution with numerical gradient descent. We theoretically demonstrate that this system can perform tasks like input-output mapping and linear regression with bias, paving the way for soft, adaptive materials that compute and learn without conventional electronics.

Abstract: Hydrides have long been considered promising candidates for achieving room-temperature superconductivity; however, the extremely high pressures typically required for high critical temperatures remain a major challenge in experiment. Here, we propose a class of high-Tc ambient-pressure superconductors with MH4 stoichiometry. These hydrogen-based compounds adopt the bcc PtHg4 structure type, in which hydrogen atoms occupy the one-quarter body-diagonal sites of metal lattices, with the metal atoms acting as chemical templates for hydrogen assembly. Through comprehensive first-principles calculations, we identify three promising superconductors, PtH4, AuH4 and PdH4, with superconducting critical temperatures of 84 K, 89 K, and 133 K, respectively, all surpassing the liquid-nitrogen temperature threshold of 77 K. The remarkable superconducting properties originate from strong electron-phonon coupling associated with hydrogen vibrations, which in turn arise from phonon softening in the mid-frequency range. Our results provide crucial insights into the design of high-Tc superconductors suitable for future experiments and applications at ambient pressure.

Abstract: Arrays of bosonic condensates of exciton-polaritons have emerged as a promising platform for simulating classical XY models, capable of rapidly reaching phase-locked states that may be mapped to arrays of two-dimensional classical spins. However, it remains unclear whether these states genuinely minimize the corresponding XY Hamiltonian and how the convergence time scales with the system size. Here, we develop an analytical model revealing that an array of $N$ condensates possesses $N$ stable phase configurations. The system selectively amplifies a specific configuration dependent on the pump power: at low power, the state with the smallest eigenvalue of an effective XY Hamiltonian is favored, while at high power, the state with the largest eigenvalue prevails. At intermediate pump powers, the system visits all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Crucially, the formation rate for any of these phase-locked states remains on the order of 100 ps, independent of the size of the array, demonstrating the exceptional speed and scalability of polariton-based XY simulators.

We propose a simple and efficient scheme that allow us to perform such computations.

Our method is illustrated by its application to calculation of the phase diagram and percolation properties of a primitive model of Laponite suspension proposed recently.

Abstract: Hydrocarbon contamination is an ever-present factor to consider in surface science measurements. In the case of van der Waals material surfaces, the structure of this contamination has become known in recent years as a self-assembled layer of normal-alkanes, resulting from a few days' exposure to ambient air. Knowledge of its composition and structure enables systematic investigation of its influence on surface properties. Here, we investigate the effect of this contamination on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy measurements by comparing clean and ambient alkane-contaminated surfaces of graphite. Our results reveal that the ambient alkane layer suppresses the well-known phonon-induced gap near the Fermi energy, resolving a long-standing inconsistency in STM studies, where this feature is often absent. Furthermore, we show that the presence of the contamination layer alters the current-distance ($I(z)$) characteristics, flattening its exponential decay by a factor of 1.5 to 5 compared to the clean surface. This change arises from extra conductance channels through the alkane layer alongside the tunnel junction, as the tip penetrates the contaminant overlayer. Finally, based on the $I(z)$ characteristics, we provide a practical guide to detect the presence of surface contamination in STM measurements.

arXiv:2511.04259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a highly efficient mechanism to rectify the motion of active particles by exploiting particle-wall alignment interactions. Through numerical simulations of active particles' dynamics in a narrow channel, we demonstrate that a slight difference in alignment strength between the top and bottom walls or a small gravitational drag suffices to break upside-down symmetry, leading to rectifying the motion of chiral active particles with over 60% efficiency. In contrast, for achiral swimmers to achieve rectified motion using this protocol, an unbiased fluid flow is necessary that can induce orbiting motion in the particle's dynamics. Thus, an achiral particle subject to Couette flow exhibits spontaneous directed motion due to an upside-down asymmetry in particle-wall alignment interaction. The rectification effects caused by alignment we report are robust against variations in self-propulsion properties, particle's chirality, and the most stable orientation of self-propulsion velocities relative to the walls. Our findings offer insights into controlled active matter transport and could be useful to sort artificial as well as natural microswimmers (such as bacteria and sperm cells) based on their chirality and self-propulsion velocities.

arXiv:2511.04263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the effects of disorder on the helical edge of the 2D topological insulator in the presence of the Zeeman field and superconductivity. Employing bosonization and a renormalization-group analysis, we study how impurity potentials modify charge- and spin-density wave correlations as well as superconducting pair correlations. Our results reveal that the Zeeman field controls the competition: in the attractive regime, it amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes impurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant regime for disorder. We also find that disorder induces logarithmic suppression of transverse density-wave correlations, while at the same time introducing positive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations and contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.

Abstract: Carbon nanomembranes (CNMs) are nanometer-thin disordered carbon materials that are suitable for a range of applications, from energy generation and storage, through to water filtration. The structure-property relationships of these nanomembranes are challenging to study using traditional experimental characterization techniques, primarily due to the radiation-sensitivity of the free-standing membrane. Highly charged ion spectroscopy is a novel characterization method that is able to infer structural details of the carbon nanomembrane without concern of induced damage affecting the measurements. Here we employ molecular dynamics simulations to produce candidate structural models of terphenylthiol-based CNMs with varying degrees of nanoscale porosity, and compare predicted ion charge exchange data and tensile moduli to experiment. The results suggest that the in-vacuum CNM composition likely comprises a significant fraction of under-coordinated carbon, with an open sub-nanometer porous structure. Such a carbon network would be reactive in atmosphere and would be presumably stabilized by hydrogen and oxygen groups under atmospheric conditions.

arXiv:2511.04278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of low-temperature electric and thermal transport in RuO$_2$, a metallic oxide which has attracted much recent attention. Careful scrutiny of electric resistivity reveals a quadratic temperature dependence below $\sim$ 20 K undetected in previous studies of electronic transport in this material. The prefactor of this T$^2$ resistivity, given the electronic specific heat, corresponds to what is expected by the Kadowaki-Woods scaling. The variation of its amplitude across 4 different samples is negligible despite an eightfold variation of residual resistivity. There is also a T$^5$ resistivity due to scattering by phonons. By measuring thermal conductivity, $\kappa$, at zero field and at 12 T, we separated its electronic and the phononic components and found that the electronic component respects the Wiedemann-Franz law at zero temperature and deviates downward at finite temperature. The latter corresponds to a threefold discrepancy between the prefactors of the two (thermal and electric) T-square resistivities. Our results, establishing RuO$_2$ as a weakly correlated Fermi liquid, provide new input for the ongoing theoretical attempt to give a quantitative account of electron-electron scattering in metallic oxides starting from first principles.

Abstract: Monolayers of group-VI transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are two-dimensional semiconductors that exhibit exceptionally strong light-matter coupling yet typically suffer from low emission quantum yields. In this letter, we investigate the heavily n-doped regime of a WSe$_2$ monolayer and show that multi-particle excitonic complexes produce photoluminescence signals up to two orders of magnitude stronger than in the neutral state. Time-resolved photoluminescence and differential reflectivity measurements reveal that the quantum yield rises with carrier density and exceeds 50% for electron concentrations above 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. These findings establish TMD monolayers as a platform for exploring excitonic complexes in high-density electron gases and point toward new opportunities for efficient, atomically thin light emitters.

Abstract: Quantum simulators enable studies of many-body phenomena which are intractable with classical hardware. Spins in devices based on semiconductor quantum dots promise precise electrical control and scalability advantages, but accessing many-body phenomena has so far been restricted by challenges in nanofabrication and simultaneous control of multiple interactions. Here, we perform spectroscopy of up to eight interacting spins using a 2x4 array of gate-defined germanium quantum dots. The spectroscopy protocol is based on Ramsey interferometry and adiabatic mapping of many-body eigenstates to single-spin eigenstates, enabling a complete energy spectrum reconstruction. As the interaction strength exceeds magnetic disorder, we observe signatures of the crossover from localization to a chaotic phase marking a step towards the observation of many-body phenomena in quantum dot systems.

Abstract: The way living tissues respond to external mechanical forces is crucial in physiological processes like embryogenesis, homeostasis or tumor growth. Providing a complete description across length scales which relates the properties of individual cells to the rheological behavior of complex 3D-tissues remains an open challenge. The development of simplified biomimetic tissues capable of reproducing essential mechanical features of living tissues can help achieving this major goal. We report in this work the development of a microfluidic device that enables to achieve the sequential assembly of biomimetic prototissues and their rheological characterization. We synthesize prototissues by the controlled assembly of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) for which we can tailor their sizes and shapes as well as their level of GUV-GUV adhesion. We address a rheological description at multiple scales which comprises an analysis at the local scale of individual GUVs and at the global scale of the prototissue. The flow behavior of prototissues ranges from purely viscous to viscoelastic for increasing levels of adhesion. At low adhesion the flow response is dominated by viscous dissipation, which is mediated by GUV spatial reorganizations at the local scale, whereas at high adhesion the flow is viscoelastic, which results from a combination of internal reorganizations and deformation of individual GUVs. Such multiscale characterization of model biomimetic tissues provides a robust framework to rationalize the role of cell adhesion in the flow dynamics of living tissues.

Abstract: Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached. However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine, such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate transmission level.

Abstract: I investigate the generic problem of lossy compression of a fluctuating stochastic signal $X$ into a discrete representation $Z$ through optimal thresholding. The signal modulates transition rates of a two-state system described by a binary variable $Y$. Optimising the retained mutual information between $Z$ and $Y$ under a constraint on fixed encoding cost of $Z$ reveals Pareto-optimal trade-offs, determined numerically using genetic algorithms. In the small-noise regime, these fronts are either concave or exhibit piecewise convex ``intrusions'' separated by first-order transitions in the optimal protocol. An analytical high-rate expansion shows that the optimal threshold density follows a universal cube-root scaling with the product of the prior distribution and the Fisher information associated with the response, which holds qualitatively even for few discrete states. Extending the analysis to non-Gaussian fluctuations reveals that for some parameters optimal encoders can yield strictly better information-cost trade-offs than Gaussian surrogates, meaning the same information content can often be achieved with fewer discrete readout states.

Abstract: Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.

Abstract: The dynamic stability of dark solitons trapped on the surface of a two-dimensional spherical bubble is investigated. In this spherical geometry of the Bose-Einstein condensate, dark solitons are found to be unstable for the interaction parameter ${\epsilon} \gtrsim 8.37$, since discrete angular modes drive snake instabilities, with the generation of vortex dipoles. We show analytically and numerically that, for each angular mode $m \ge 2$, there exists exactly one unstable mode whose dominance determines the number m of vortex dipoles. Time-dependent simulations confirm the formation of vortex dipoles.

Abstract: We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of angle-dependent parametric pumping of magnons in Yttrium Iron Garnet films, with a focus on the mechanisms that transfer parametrically injected magnons toward the spectral minimum where Bose-Einstein condensation occurs. Using a classical Hamiltonian formalism, we analyze the threshold conditions for parametric instability as a function of the angle between the microwave pumping field and the external magnetic field, continuously tracing the transition between parallel and transverse pumping. We also describe two competing four-magnon scattering mechanisms that transfer parametric magnons toward the bottom of their frequency spectrum: The step-by-step Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade, which is allowed for all magnetic field values, and the kinetic instability mechanisms that provide a much more efficient single-step channel in transferring magnons directly to the lowest-energy states, but occurs within specific regions of the pumping angle and the external magnetic field where the conservation laws permit it. In the experimental part, we employ microfocused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy in combination with a vector magnet, allowing for angle-resolved mapping of the magnon population spectrum under controlled pumping angle. We observe that transverse pumping, although characterized by a higher instability threshold, yields a markedly stronger population at the spectral minimum compared to parallel pumping. These observations demonstrate that the kinetic instability channel plays a dominant role in transferring magnons to the spectral minimum under such conditions. These results reveal the crucial role of pumping geometry in shaping the magnon distribution and provide guidelines for optimizing the flux of magnons into the condensate, thereby advancing the control of magnon Bose-Einstein condensation in magnetic insulators.

Abstract: We study a broad class of qudit stabilizer codes, termed $\mathbb{Z}_N$ bivariate-bicycle (BB) codes, arising either as two-dimensional realizations of modulated gauge theories or as $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalizations of binary BB codes. Our central finding, derived from the polynomial representation, is that the essential topological properties of these $\mathbb{Z}_N$ codes can be determined by the properties of their $\mathbb{Z}_p$ counterparts, where $p$ are the prime factors of $N$, even when $N$ contains prime powers ($N = \prod_i p_i^{k_i}$). This result yields a significant simplification by leveraging the well-studied framework of codes with prime qudit dimensions. In particular, this insight directly enables the generalization of the algebraic-geometric methods (e.g., the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem) to determine anyon fusion rules in the general qudit situation. Moreover, we analyze the model's symmetry-enriched topological order (SET) to reveal a quasi-fractonic behavior, resolving the anyon mobility puzzle in this class of models. We also present a computational algebraic method using Gr\"{o}bner bases over the ring of integers to efficiently calculate the topological order and its SET properties.

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between microstructure, strain, phase, and material behavior is crucial in many scientific fields. However, quantifying these correlations is challenging, as it requires the use of multiple instruments and techniques, often separated by space and time. The Dual Imaging And Diffraction (DIAD) beamline at Diamond is designed to address this challenge. DIAD allows its users to visualize internal structures, identify compositional/phase changes, and measure strain. DIAD provides two independent beams combined at one sample position, allowing quasi-simultaneous X-ray Computed Tomography and X-ray Powder Diffraction. A unique functionality of the DIAD configuration is the ability to perform image-guided diffraction, where the micron-sized diffraction beam is scanned over the complete area of the imaging field of view without moving the specimen. This moving beam diffraction geometry enables the study of fast-evolving and motion-susceptible processes and samples. Here, we discuss the novel moving beam diffraction geometry presenting the latest findings on the reliability of both geometry calibration and data reduction routines used. Our measures confirm diffraction is most sensitive to the moving geometry for the detector position downstream normal to the incident beam. The observed data confirm that the motion of the KB mirror coupled with a fixed aperture slit results in a rigid translation of the beam probe, without affecting the angle of the incident beam path to the sample. Our measures demonstrate a nearest-neighbour calibration can achieve the same accuracy as a self-calibrated geometry when the distance between calibrated and probed sample region is smaller or equal to the beam spot size. We show the absolute error of the moving beam diffraction geometry remains below 0.0001, which is the accuracy we observe for the beamline with stable beam operation.

Abstract: Inorganic crystal materials have broad application potential due to excellent physical and chemical properties, with elastic properties (shear modulus, bulk modulus) crucial for predicting materials' electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and mechanical properties. Traditional experimental measurement suffers from high cost and low efficiency, while theoretical simulation and graph neural network-based machine learning methods--especially crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNNs)--have become effective alternatives, achieving remarkable results in predicting material elastic properties. This study trained two CGCNN models using shear modulus and bulk modulus data of 10987 materials from the Matbench v0.1 dataset, which exhibit high accuracy (mean absolute error <13, coefficient of determination R-squared close to 1) and good generalization ability. Materials were screened to retain those with band gaps between 0.1-3.0 eV and exclude radioactive element-containing compounds. The final predicted dataset comprises two parts: 54359 crystal structures from the Materials Project database and 26305 crystal structures discovered by Merchant et al. (2023 Nature 624 80). Ultimately, this study completed the prediction of shear modulus and bulk modulus for 80664 inorganic crystals. This work enriches existing material elastic data resources and provides robust support for material design, with all data openly available at https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.j00213.00104.

Abstract: We study the correlated electronic structure and local spin behaviour of the copper-substituted lead-vanadium bromine apatite Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ using DFT+DMFT with a two-orbital Cu-centred low-energy model. Simulations are done for several temperatures (20, 60, 100 K) and a broad range of band fillings 2.46 $\leq$ n $\leq$ 3.54. We find that the present compound stays metallic even once correlations are treated dynamically around the stoichiometric filling (n $\simeq$ 3). Away from n $\simeq$ 3, both hole and electron doping drive the system toward non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, and spectral weight is transferred from the low-energy peak into upper and lower Hubbard-like features. By analysing the low-frequency self-energy exponent and the dynamical part of the local spin susceptibility, we identify a narrow window of enhanced spin fluctuations on the slightly hole-doped side (n $\simeq$ 2.94), i.e. a spin-freezing-crossover regime of the kind reported in the literature for multiorbital Hund metals. This places Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ among the promising members of the Cu-substituted apatite family.

Abstract: The study of the interplay of applied external magnetic field and superconductivity has been invigorated by recent works on Bernal bilayer and rhombohedral multilayer graphene. These studies, with and without proximitized spin-orbit coupling, have opened up a new frontier in the exploration of unconventional superconductors as they offer a unique platform to investigate superconductivity with high degree of in-plane magnetic field resilience and even magnetic field-induced superconductivity. Here, we present a framework for analyzing the upper critical in-plane magnetic field data in multilayer superconductors. Our framework relies on an analytically tractable superconducting pairing model that captures the normal state phenomenology of these systems and applies it to calculate the relationship between the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ and the corresponding critical temperature $T_{c}$. We study the $H_{c2}-T_{c}$ critical curve as a function of experimental parameters (Ising and Rashba spin-orbit coupling) and depairing mechanisms (Zeeman and orbital coupling) for both spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing. By applying our framework to analyze four recent Bernal bilayer graphene-WSe$_2$ experiments [1-4], we identify an apparent discrepancy between fitted and measured spin-orbit parameters, which we propose can be explained by an enhancement of the Land\'e g factor in the Bernal bilayer graphene experiments.

Abstract: The precise identification of neurotransmitters is essential for comprehending cerebral function, detecting neurological conditions, and formulating successful therapeutic approaches. The present work investigates the electrochemical detection of serotonin with the excellent hybrid electrocatalyst $Cu_2S/H{\beta}cd-rGO$. $Cu_2S$, with its significant features as improved catalytic activity and enhanced charge transfer when combined with $H{\beta}cd-rGO$, will enhance the performance. The integration of $Cu_2S$ with $H{\beta}cd-rGO$, regulated by the van der Waals force and the electrostatic interaction, makes it a stable catalyst without disrupting the composite structure. Also, the aggregation of the $Cu_2S/H{\beta}cd$ with the layered sheets of rGO can be highly reduced and resulting in the improvement of the conductivity. Thus, the above features resulted in the improved oxidation response current when fabricated over the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The SR showed sensitive response at a broad linear range of 0.019 to 0.299 $\mu$M and 4.28 to 403.14 $\mu$M, resulting in a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 1.2 nM or 0.0012 $\mu$M and a sensitivity of about 15.9 $\mu$A ${\mu}M^{-1}$ $cm^{-2}$. The sensor demonstrated excellent selectivity against common interferents, including aminophenol, dopamine, epinephrine, hydroquinone, melatonin, and chlorine. The real sample studies in the biological samples show good recovery values, showing the effectiveness of the as-fabricated sensor. Thus, the cost-efficient and straightforward integration of $Cu_2S/H{\beta}cd-rGO$ will be an outstanding electrocatalyst for detecting SR.

Abstract: Understanding charge transfer at oxide interfaces is crucial for designing materials with emergent electronic and magnetic properties, especially in systems where strong electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling coexist. SrIrO$_3$/SrCoO$_3$ (SIO/SCO) superlattices offer a unique platform to explore these effects due to their contrasting electronic structures and magnetic behaviors. Building on past theory based on continuity of O 2p band alignment, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to model electron transfer from Ir to Co across the SIO/SCO interface. To characterize these effects, we synthesized epitaxial SIO/SCO superlattices via molecular beam epitaxy. Structural and transport measurements confirmed high crystallinity, metallic behavior, and suppression of Kondo scattering that has been reported in uniform SIO films. Further characterization via X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed orbital anisotropy and valence changes consistent with interfacial charge transfer. Co K- and L$_{2,3}$-edge and Ir L$_2$-edge spectra verified electron donation from Ir to Co, stabilizing the perovskite SCO phase and tuning the electronic structure of SIO via hole-doping. O K-edge XAS showed band alignment shifts in the SIO layer consistent with DFT predictions. Our work here provides a pathway for engineering oxide heterostructures with tailored magnetic and electronic properties.

arXiv:2511.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freeze-thaw cycles can be regularly observed in nature in water and are essential in industry and science. Objects present in the medium will interact with either an advancing solidification front during freezing or a retracting solidification front, i.e., an advancing melting front, during thawing. It is well known that objects show complex behaviours when interacting with the advancing solidification front, but the extent to which they are displaced during the retraction of the solid-liquid interface is less well understood. To study potential hysteresis effects during freeze-thaw cycles, we exploit experimental model systems of oil-in-water emulsions and polystyrene (PS) particle suspensions, in which a water-ice solidification front advances and retracts over an individual immiscible (and deformable) oil droplet or over a solid PS particle. We record several interesting hysteresis effects, resulting in non-zero relative displacements of the objects between freezing and thawing. PS particles tend to migrate further and further away from their initial position, whereas oil droplets tend to return to their starting positions during thawing. We rationalize our experimental findings by comparing them to our prior theoretical model of Meijer, Bertin & Lohse, Phys. Rev. Fluids (2025), yielding a qualitatively good agreement. Additionally, we look into the reversibility of how the droplet deforms and re-shapes throughout one freeze-thaw cycle, which will turn out to be remarkably robust.

Abstract: Donor spin qubits in silicon offer one- and two-qubit gates with fidelities beyond 99%, coherence times exceeding 30 seconds, and compatibility with industrial manufacturing methods. This motivates the development of large-scale quantum processors using this platform, and the ability to automatically tune and operate such complex devices. In this work, we present the first machine learning algorithm with the ability to automatically locate the charge transitions of an ion-implanted donor in a silicon device, tune single-shot charge readout, and identify the gate voltage parameters where tunnelling rates in and out the donor site are the same. The entire tuning pipeline is completed on the order of minutes. Our results enable both automatic characterisation and tuning of a donor in silicon devices faster than human experts.

arXiv:2511.04551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott insulators with a buckled honeycomb structure as potential candidates to host a high-temperature AF Chern insulator (AFCI). Using a generalized Kondo lattice model we show that the staggered potential induced by a perpendicular electric field due to the buckling can drive the AF Mott insulator to an AFCI phase. We address the temperature evolution of the Hall conductance and the chiral edge states. The quantization temperature $T_q$, below which the Hall conductance is quantized, depends essentially on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the hopping parameter, independent of the specific details of the model. The deviation of the Hall conductance from the quantized value $e^2/h$ above $T_q$ is found to be accompanied by a spectral broadening of the chiral edge states, reflecting a finite life-time, i.e., a decay. Using parameters typical for heavy transition-metal elements we predict that the AFCI can survive up to room temperature. We suggest Sr$_3$CaOs$_2$O$_9$ as a potential compound to realize a high-$T$ AFCI phase.

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the superfluid properties of a two-dimensional, weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in the zero-temperature regime, when it is subjected to a triangular optical lattice potential. We implement an original method, which involves solving the hydrodynamic continuity equation to extract the superfluid fraction tensor from the measured in situ density distribution of the fluid at rest. In parallel, we apply an independent dynamical approach that combines compressibility and sound velocity measurements to determine the superfluid fraction. Both methods yield consistent results in good agreement with simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation as well as with the Leggett bounds determined from the measured density profiles.

Abstract: The supercurrent diode effect (SDE), characterized by nonreciprocal critical currents, represents a promising building block for future dissipationless electronics and quantum circuits. Realizing SDE requires breaking both time-reversal and inversion symmetry in the device. Here we use conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) lithography to pattern reconfigurable superconducting weak links (WLs) at the LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) interface. By deliberately engineering the WL geometry at the nanoscale, we realize SDE in these devices in the presence of modest out-of-plane magnetic fields. The SDE polarity can be reversed by simply changing the WL position, and the rectification efficiency reaches up to 13% under optimal magnetic field conditions. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations reveal that the observed SDE originates from asymmetric vortex motion in the inversion-symmetry-breaking device geometry. This demonstration of SDE in the LAO/KTO system establishes a versatile platform for investigating and engineering vortex dynamics, forming the basis for engineered quantum circuit elements.

arXiv:2511.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical phase-field theories of brittle fracture capture toughness-controlled crack propagation but do not account for the material's strength surface, which governs fracture nucleation in the absence of cracks. The phase-field formulation of Kumar et al. (2020) proposed a blueprint for incorporating the strength surface while preserving toughness-controlled propagation by introducing a nucleation driving force and presented results for the Drucker--Prager surface. Following this blueprint, Chockalingam (2025) recently derived a general driving-force expression that incorporates arbitrary strength surfaces. The present work implements this driving force within a finite-element framework and incorporates representative strength surfaces that span diverse mathematical and physical characteristics -- the Mohr--Coulomb, 3D Hoek--Brown, and Mogi--Coulomb surfaces. Through simulations of canonical fracture problems, the formulation is comprehensively validated across fracture regimes, capturing (i) nucleation under uniform stress, (ii) crack growth from large pre-existing flaws, and (iii) fracture governed jointly by strength and toughness. While the strength surfaces examined here already encompass a broad range of brittle materials, the results demonstrate the generality and robustness of the proposed driving-force construction for materials governed by arbitrary strength surfaces.

arXiv:2511.04629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental evidences of spontaneous time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking have been reported for the superconducting ground state in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductor 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ or chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ hybrid superlattices, and is regarded as evidence of emergent chiral superconductivity. However, the $T_c$ of these TMD superconductors is of the same order as pristine 1H or 2H-TaS$_2$, which do not show any signature of TR breaking and are believed to be conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. To resolve this puzzle, we propose a new type of pair-mixing state that mixes the dominant conventional s-wave pairing channel with the subdominant chiral p-wave pairing channel via a finite Cooper-pair momentum, based on symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis shows that the fourth-order terms in the chiral p-wave channel can lead to a variety of pair-mixing states with spontaneous TR breaking. These TR-breaking superconducting states also reveal a zero-field, junction-free superconducting diode effect that is observed in chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ superlattices.

Abstract: The occurrence of strong coupling or nonlinear scaling behavior for kinetically rough interfaces whose dynamics are conserved, but not necessarily variational, remains to be fully understood. Here we formulate and study a family of conserved stochastic evolution equations for one-dimensional interfaces, whose nonlinearity depends on a parameter n, thus generalizing that of the stochastic Burgers equation, whose behavior is retrieved for n=0. This family of equations includes as particular instances a stochastic porous medium equation and other continuum models relevant to various hard and soft condensed matter systems. We perform a one-loop dynamical renormalization group analysis of the equations, which contemplates strong coupling scaling exponents that depend on the value of $n$ and may or may not imply vertex renormalization. These analytical expectations are contrasted with explicit numerical simulations of the equations with n=1,2, and 3. For odd n, numerical stability issues have required us to generalize the scheme originally proposed for n=0 by T. Sasamoto and H. Spohn. Precisely for n=1 and 3, and at variance with the n=0 and 2 cases (whose numerical exponents are consistent with non-renormalization of the vertex), numerical strong coupling exponent values are obtained which suggest vertex renormalization, akin to that reported for the celebrated conserved KPZ equation. We also study numerically the statistics of height fluctuations, whose probability distribution function turns out (at variance with cKPZ) to have zero skewness for long times and at saturation, irrespective of the value of n. However, the kurtosis is non-Gaussian, further supporting the conclusion on strong coupling asymptotic behavior. The zero skewness seems related with space symmetries of the n=0 and 2 equations, and with an emergent symmetry at the strong coupling fixed point for odd values of n.

Abstract: Sutherland showed that the XYZ quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian commutes with the eight-vertex model transfer matrix, so that Baxter's subsequent tour de force proves the integrability of both. The proof requires parametrising the Boltzmann weights using elliptic theta functions and showing they satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. We here give a simpler derivation of the integrability of the XYZ chain by explicitly constructing an extensive sequence of conserved charges from a matrix-product operator. We show that they commute with the XYZ Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions or an arbitrary boundary magnetic field. A straightforward generalisation yields impurity interactions that preserve the integrability. Placing such an impurity at the edge gives an integrable generalisation of the Kondo problem with a gapped bulk. We make contact with the traditional approach by relating our matrix-product operator to products of the eight-vertex model transfer matrix.

Abstract: Spread complexity uses the distribution of support of a time-evolving state in the Krylov basis to quantify dispersal across accessible dimensions of a Hilbert space. Here, we describe how variations in initial conditions, the Hamiltonian, and the dimension of the Hilbert space affect spread complexity and Krylov basis structure. We introduce Koherence, the entropy of coherence between perturbed and unperturbed Krylov bases, which can, e.g., quantify dynamical amplification of differences in initial conditions in chaos. To illustrate, we show that dynamics on SL(2,R), SU(2), and Heisenberg-Weyl group manifolds, often used as paradigmatic settings for contrasting chaotic and integrable (semi-)classical behavior, display distinctively different responses to variations of the initial state or Hamiltonian. We then describe a lattice model that displays linear growth of spread complexity, saturating for bounded lattices and continuing forever in a thermodynamic limit. The latter example illustrates a breakdown of continuum/classical effective descriptions of complexity growth in bounded quantum systems.

Abstract: One of the surprising, and potentially very useful, capabilities of analog quantum computers, such as D-Wave quantum annealers, is sampling from the Boltzmann, or Gibbs, distribution defined by a classical Hamiltonian. In this study, we thoroughly examine the ability of D-Wave quantum annealers to sample from the Boltzmann distribution defined of a canonical type of competing magnetic frustration $J_1$-$J_2$ model; the ANNNI (axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising) model. Boltzmann sampling error rate is quantified for standard linear-ramp anneals ranging from $5$ nanosecond annealing times up to $2000$ microseconds on two different D-Wave quantum annealing processors. Interestingly, we find some analog hardware parameters which result in a very high accuracy (down to a TVD of $0.0003$) and low temperature sampling (down to $\beta=32.2$) in a frustrated region of the ANNNI model magnetic phase diagram. This bolsters the viability of current analog quantum computers for thermodynamic sampling applications of highly frustrated magnetic spin systems.

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) are localized waves in electronic, photonic and acoustic systems, which remain decoupled from surrounding propagating waves and hence maintain their oscillation for extraordinary long time [Nat Rev Mater 1, 16048 (2016)]. In photonic crystals, symmetry-protected quasi-BICs (SP-qBIC) have been realized at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and utilized in photonic crystal and distributed feedback lasers. In the present work, we measure wavevector-resolved photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer WSe2 weakly coupled to a photonic slab, consisting of a square array of aluminum nanodisks. The results show that the slab supports a continuous band of symmetry-protected quasi-bound states along the Gamma-X direction, extending from the previously reported SP-qBIC at the Gamma point. The spectral width of this quasi-bound band in the continuum remains narrow through at least a half of the Brillouin zone, indicating its long lifetime.

Abstract: Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law) scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms accurately describes local evolution.

Abstract: Quantum photonic networks require two distinct functionalities: bright single-photon sources and long-lived quantum memories. III-V semiconductor quantum dots excel as deterministic and coherent photon emitters, while rare-earth ions such as erbium (Er$^{3+}$) in crystalline oxides offer exceptional spin and optical coherence at telecom wavelengths. Combining these systems and their functionalities via direct epitaxy is challenging due to lattice mismatch and incompatible growth conditions. Here we demonstrate low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Controlled surface preparation with an arsenic cap and an oxygen-deficient buffer layer enables the growth of epitaxial anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390$^{o}$C with sub-300 pm surface roughness, while avoiding interface degradation. In contrast, high-temperature oxide desorption or growth temperatures drive the transition to rough, polycrystalline rutile film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Minimal coincident interface area (MCIA) modeling explains the orientation-selective growth on GaAs and GaSb. Raman and cryogenic photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy verify the crystal phase and optical activation of Er$^{3+}$ ions. This multi-parameter growth strategy helps preserve III-V quantum dot functionality and yields smooth surfaces suitable for low-loss nanophotonic structures. Our results establish a materials platform for monolithically integrating rare-earth quantum memories with semiconductor photon sources, paving the way toward scalable hybrid quantum photonic chips.

Abstract: Electron microscopy (EM) is a foundational tool for directly assessing the structure of materials. Recent advances in direct electron detectors have improved signal-to noise ratios via single-electron counting. However, accurately counting electrons at high fluence remains challenging. We developed a new method of electron counting for direct electron detectors, Back-Propagation Counting (BPC). BPC uses machine learning techniques designed for mathematical operations on large tensors but does not require large training datasets. In synthetic data, we show BPC is able to count multiple electron strikes per pixel and is robust to increasing occupancy. In experimental data, frames counted with BPC are shown to reconstruct diffraction peaks corresponding to individual nanoparticles with relatively higher intensity and produce images with improved contrast when compared to a standard counting method. Together, these results show that BPC excels in experiments where pixels see a high flux of electron irradiation such as in situ TEM movies and diffraction.

Abstract: Integrable trotterization provides a method to evolve a continuous time integrable many-body system in discrete time, such that it retains its conserved quantities. Here we explicitly show that the first order trotterization of the critical transverse field Ising model is integrable. The discrete time conserved quantities are obtained from an inhomogeneous transfer matrix constructed using the quantum inverse scattering method. The inhomogeneity parameter determines the discrete time step. We then focus on the non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry for the trotterized evolution. We find that the discretization of both space and time leads to a doubling of these duality operators. They account for discrete translations in both space and time. As an interesting application, we find that these operators also provide maps between trotterizations of different orders. This helps us extend our results beyond the trotterization scheme and investigate the Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry for finite time Floquet evolution of the critical transverse field Ising chain.

arXiv:2511.03977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce an exact expression for the response of a semi-classical two-level quantum system subject to arbitrary periodic driving. Determining the transition probabilities of a two-level system driven by an arbitrary periodic waveform necessitates numerical calculations through methods such as Floquet theory, requiring the truncation of an infinite matrix. However, such truncation can lead to a loss of significant interference information, hindering quantum sensors or introducing artifacts in quantum control. To alleviate this issue, we use the $\star$-resolvent formalism with the path-sum theorem to determine the exact series solution to Schr\"odinger's equation, therefore providing the exact transition probability. The resulting series solution is generated from a compact kernel expression containing all of the information of the periodic drive and then expanded in a non-harmonic Fourier series basis given by the divided difference of complex exponentials with coefficients corresponding to products of generalized Bessel functions. The present method provides an analytical formulation for quantum sensors and control applications.

Abstract: We investigate energy propagation in a one-dimensional stub lattice in the presence of both disorder and nonlinearity. In the periodic case, the stub lattice hosts two dispersive bands separated by a flat band; however, we show that sufficiently strong disorder fills all intermediate band gaps. By mapping the two-dimensional parameter space of disorder and nonlinearity, we identify three distinct dynamical regimes (weak chaos, strong chaos, and self-trapping) through numerical simulations of initially localized wave packets. When disorder is strong enough to close the frequency gaps, the results closely resemble those obtained in the one-dimensional disordered discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation and Klein-Gordon lattice model. In particular, subdiffusive spreading is observed in both the weak and strong chaos regimes, with the second moment $m_2$ of the norm distribution scaling as $m_2 \propto t^{0.33}$ and $m_2 \propto t^{0.5}$, respectively. The system's chaotic behavior follows a similar trend, with the finite-time maximum Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda$ decaying as $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.25}$ and $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.3}$. For moderate disorder strengths, i.e., near the point of gap closing, we find that the presence of small frequency gaps does not exert any noticeable influence on the spreading behavior. Our findings extend the characterization of nonlinear disordered lattices in both weak and strong chaos regimes to other network geometries, such as the stub lattice, which serves as a representative flat-band system.

Abstract: We present an analytical theory of second harmonic generation (SHG) in hybrid structures combining a nonlinear 2D crystal with a dielectric metasurface waveguide. The theory describes the excitation spectrum and enhancement of SHG at both leaky mode and quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC) resonances in terms of the material parameters. For low-loss systems, the SHG efficiency at leaky resonances is determined by their radiative broadening, governed by the relevant Fourier harmonics of the metasurface polarizability, whereas the SHG enhancement at quasi-BIC resonances is ultimately limited by inhomogeneous broadening and absorption in the system. We also describe the emergence and polarization properties of second harmonic diffracted beams. These beams appear even if both the 2D crystal and the meta-waveguide are centrosymmetric owing to the nonlocal mechanism of SHG. The developed framework provides a systematic theoretical basis for optimizing the resonant nonlinear frequency conversion in hybrid 2D-material-metasurface platforms and identifies the fundamental limitations of the SHG efficiency.

arXiv:2511.04326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental target.

arXiv:2511.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a state farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to it, is a striking phenomenon in both classical and quantum systems. In open quantum systems, however, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) typically occurs only for specifically chosen initial states, which limits its universality. Here we present a general and experimentally feasible strategy to realize both QME and anti-QME. By applying a temporary bond-dissipation quench, we selectively suppresses or enhances slow relaxation modes, thereby reshaping relaxation pathways independently of both the system and the initial state. We demonstrate this mechanism in systems with dephasing and boundary dissipation, and outline feasible cold-atom implementations. Our results establish controllable dissipation as a versatile tool for quantum control, accelerated relaxation, and efficient nonequilibrium protocols.

Abstract: Twisted cylindrical tubes are important model systems for nanostructures, heterostructures, and curved quantum devices. In this work, we investigate the quantum behavior of an electron confined to a twisted cylindrical surface. By first calculating the strain tensor to obtain the induced surface metric, we employ da Costa's formalism to derive the geometry-induced quantum potential. This potential modifies the Schr\"odinger equation even in the absence of external forces, allowing us to determine the bound states and energy eigenvalues. This was made in the linear and non-linear torsion regime. Furthermore, we analyze two distinct scattering problems: (i) scattering within an infinite cylinder containing a twisted section, and (ii) scattering of a free particle incident upon a finite twisted cylinder. Our goal is to understand how geometry and strain influence the properties of analogous untwisted systems. It turns out that both the linear and non-linear twists yield to a geometric phase into the wave function, while the da Costa potential is kept unchanged. Consequently, the system supports bound states whose energie spectrum is twist independent. For both scattering problems, we find that the transmission probability is insensitive to torsion, whereas it is significantly affected by the particle angular momentum and the cylinder's radius, exhibiting distinct oscillatory behavior. These findings suggest relevant implications for engineering quantum devices based on materials with controlled curvature and twist.

arXiv:2511.04402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits, MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay gives rise to a new class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional dimerized Heisenberg model. Furthermore, we provide a diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional Hamiltonians. Our results highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems.

Abstract: Exactly solvable models of topologically ordered phases with non-abelian anyons typically require complicated many-body interactions which do not naturally appear in nature. This motivates the "inverse problem" of quantum many-body physics: given microscopic systems with experimentally realistic two-body interactions, how to design a Hamiltonian that realizes a desired topological phase? Here we solve this problem on a platform motivated by Rydberg atoms, where elementary two-level systems couple via simple blockade interactions. Within this framework, we construct Hamiltonians that realize topological orders described by non-abelian quantum double models. We analytically prove the existence of topological order in the ground state, and present efficient schemes to prepare these states. We also introduce protocols for the controlled adiabatic braiding of anyonic excitations to probe their non-abelian statistics. Our construction is generic and applies to quantum doubles $\mathcal{D}(G)$ for arbitrary finite groups $G$. We illustrate braiding for the simplest non-abelian quantum double $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$.

Abstract: Accurately determining ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems remains one of the major challenges of quantum simulation. In this work, we present a protocol for estimating the ground-state energy using only global time evolution under a target Hamiltonian. This avoids the need for controlled operations that are typically required in conventional quantum phase estimation and extends the algorithm applicability to analog simulators. Our method extracts energy differences from measurements of the Loschmidt echo over an initial ground-state approximation, combines them with direct energy measurements, and solves a set of equations to infer the individual eigenenergies. We benchmark this protocol on free-fermion systems, showing orders-of-magnitude precision gains over direct energy measurements on the initial state, with accuracy improving rapidly with initial-state fidelity and persisting for hundreds of modes. We further demonstrate applicability to the 2D Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models and show that the approach extends naturally to other observables such as order parameters. Finally, we analyze the effect of experimental imperfections and propose error-mitigation strategies. These results establish a practical route to compute physically relevant quantities with high precision using globally controlled quantum simulators.

Abstract: This study presents a method for deterministic Er3+ doping of x-cut TFLN using focused ion beam (FIB) implantation with sub-100 nm spatial precision, enabling seamless integration of active rare-earth ions into this technologically relevant platform for lithium niobate integrated nanophotonics. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements from implanted regions reveal Stark-split 4f-4f transitions consistent with bulk Er-doped lithium niobate, indicating similar lattice occupation. Temperature-dependent PL measurements from 300 K to 5 K exhibit conventional behaviour down to approximately 50 K, followed by a marked decrease in the emission intensity and lifetime. This anomaly is attributed to a suppression of the pyroelectric response in LiNbO3 at low temperatures, which affects local electric fields and, consequently, Er3+ emission. The sensitivity of the PL response to the modulation frequency and polarization of the 980 nm excitation light is also consistent with possible mechanisms linking thermal effects and internal fields arising in the thin film. The results demonstrate a method for the targeted doping with Er3+ ions into the most widely used cut of TFLN for integrated photonic devices and provide further important considerations for their exploitation in cryogenic quantum devices.

As an application, we use this ansatz to construct several families of continuous matrix product unitaries beyond quantum cellular automata.

Abstract: We introduce quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search (QE-MTS), a non-variational hybrid algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art scaling for the low-autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem. By seeding the classical MTS with high-quality initial states from digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO), our method suppresses the empirical time-to-solution scaling to $\mathcal{O}(1.24^N)$ for sequence length $N \in [27,37]$. This scaling surpasses the best-known classical heuristic $\mathcal{O}(1.34^N)$ and improves upon the $\mathcal{O}(1.46^N)$ of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, achieving superior performance with a $6\times$ reduction in circuit depth. A two-stage bootstrap analysis confirms the scaling advantage and projects a crossover point at $N \gtrsim 47$, beyond which QE-MTS outperforms its classical counterpart. These results provide evidence that quantum enhancement can directly improve the scaling of classical optimization algorithms for the paradigmatic LABS problem.

arXiv:2511.04597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an improved Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) algorithm called Harmonic PIMC (H-PIMC) and its generalization, Mixed PIMC (M-PIMC). PIMC is a powerful tool for studying quantum condensed phases. However, it often suffers from a low acceptance ratio for solids and dense confined liquids. We develop two sampling schemes especially suited for such problems by dividing the potential into its harmonic and anharmonic contributions. In H-PIMC, we generate the imaginary time paths for the harmonic part of the potential exactly and accept or reject it based on the anharmonic part. In M-PIMC, we restrict the harmonic sampling to the vicinity of local minimum and use standard PIMC otherwise, to optimize efficiency. We benchmark H-PIMC on systems with increasing anharmonicity, improving the acceptance ratio and lowering the auto-correlation time. For weakly to moderately anharmonic systems, at $\beta \hbar \omega=16$, H-PIMC improves the acceptance ratio by a factor of 6-16 and reduces the autocorrelation time by a factor of 7-30. We also find that the method requires a smaller number of imaginary time slices for convergence, which leads to another two- to four-fold acceleration. For strongly anharmonic systems, M-PIMC converges with a similar number of imaginary time slices as standard PIMC, but allows the optimization of the auto-correlation time. We extend M-PIMC to periodic systems and apply it to a sinusoidal potential. Finally, we combine H- and M-PIMC with the worm algorithm, allowing us to obtain similar efficiency gains for systems of indistinguishable particles.

In the large n limit, the distribution converges to a Gaussian whose mean and variance depend solely on those of the eigenvalues. This result resolves the apparent paradox between bimodal eigenvalue distribution and unimodal transmissivity distribution.

Abstract: Large assemblies of extremely simple robots capable only of basic motion activities (like propelling forward or self-rotating) are often applied to study swarming behavior or implement various phenomena characteristic of active matter composed of non-equilibrium particles that convert their energy to a directed motion. As a result, a great abundance of compact swarm robots have been developed. The simplest are bristle-bots that self-propel via converting their vibration with the help of elastic bristles. However, many platforms are optimized for a certain class of studies, are not always made open-source, or have limited customization potential. To address these issues, we develop the open-source Swarmodroid 1.0 platform based on bristle-bots with reconfigurable 3D printed bodies and simple electronics that possess external control of motion velocity and demonstrate basic capabilities of trajectory adjustment. Then, we perform a detailed analysis of individual Swarmodroids' motion characteristics and their kinematics. In addition, we introduce the AMPy software package in Python that features OpenCV-based extraction of robotic swarm kinematics accompanied by the evaluation of key physical quantities describing the collective dynamics. Finally, we discuss potential applications as well as further directions for fundamental studies and Swarmodroid 1.0 platform development.

Abstract: In the recently discovered kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs), superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge density wave order. The pairing symmetry remains elusive owing to the lack of direct measurement of the superconducting gap in the momentum space. Here, utilizing laser-based ultra-high-resolution and low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe Fermi-surface-dependent anisotropic Cooper pairing in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. We detect a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure with anisotropy exceeding 80% and a gap maximum along the V-V bond direction on a Fermi surface originating from the 3d-orbital electrons of the V kagome lattice. This is in stark contrast to the isotropic superconducting gap structure on the Fermi surface occupied by Sb 5p-orbital electrons. Our direct observation of the Fermi-surface-dependent anisotropic pairing in CsV3Sb5 is fundamental for understanding the intertwined orders in the ground state of kagome superconductors.

Abstract: In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) devices, local strains frequently coexist and intertwine with the twist-angle-dependent moir\'e superlattice, significantly influencing the electronic properties of TBG, yet their combined effects remain incompletely understood. Here, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we study a TBG device exhibiting both a continuous twist-angle gradient from 0.35{\deg} to 1.30{\deg} and spatially varying strain fields, spanning the first (1.1{\deg}), second (0.5{\deg}) and third (0.3{\deg}) magic angles. We visualize the evolution of flat and remote bands in energy and real space with atomic resolution. Near the first magic angle, we discover an anomalous spectral weight transfer between the two flat band peaks, signifying the role of strain and electronic correlations, as further evidenced by an unusual spatial dispersion of these peaks within a moir\'e unit cell. In contrast, remote band peak energy offers a strain-insensitive indicator of the local twist angle. Structural analysis further reveals non-negligible shear strain across the sample. All observations are quantitatively reproduced by a continuum model that incorporates heterostrain and a self-consistent Hartree potential, revealing the critical but unexplored role of shear strain in shaping the low-energy electronic landscape of TBG.

Abstract: Quantum information measures are proposed to analyze the structure of near-gap electronic states in HgTe quantum wells in a strip geometry $(x,y)\in (-\infty,\infty)\times [0,L]$ of finite width $L$. This allows us to establish criteria for distinguishing edge from bulk states in the topological insulator phase, including the transition region and cutoff of the wave number $k_x$ where edge states degenerate with bulk states. Qualitative and quantitative information on the near-gap Hamiltonian eigenstates, obtained by tight-binding calculations, is extracted from localization measures, like the inverse participation ratio (IPR), entanglement entropies of the reduced density matrix (RDM) to the spin sector --measuring quantum correlations due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-- and from correlation functions for a $y$-space partition. The analysis of IPR and entanglement entropies in terms of spin, wave number $k_x$ and position $y$, evidences a spin polarization structure and spatial confinement of near-gap wave functions at the boundaries $y=0,L$ and low $k_x$, as correspond to helical edge states. IPR localization measures provide momentum $k_x$ cutoffs from which near-gap states are no longer localized at the boundaries of the sample and become part of the bulk. Below this $k_x$-point cutoff, the entanglement entropy and the spin probabilities of the RDM also capture the spin polarization structure of edge states and exhibit a higher variability compared to the relatively low entropy of the bulk state region. For a real-space partition, the edge-state region in momentum space exhibits lower correlation modulus, but higher correlation arguments, than the bulk-state region.

Abstract: Simple active models of matter recapitulate complex biological phenomena. The out-of-equilibrium nature of these models, however, often makes them beyond the reach of first-principle descriptions. This limitation is particularly perplexing when attempting to distinguish between different glass-forming mechanisms. We here consider a minimal active system in various spatial dimensions to identify the processes underlying their sluggish dynamics. Activity is found to markedly impact cage escape processes and critical fluctuations associated with exploring lower-dimensional caging features.

Abstract: The gyrotropic magnetic effect (GME), which emerges as the low-frequency limit of natural gyrotopy, is a fundamental property of Bloch electrons on the Fermi surface in materials lacking inversion symmetry. While Weyl semimetals were among the first systems predicted to host the GME, this effect has not yet been experimentally observed in these materials. Here, we theoretically propose a robust scheme to generate a significant GME in anisotropic nodal-line semimetals using Floquet engineering with bicircular light (BCL). We show that BCL irradiation can selectively break spatial and time-reversal symmetries, inducing a topological phase transition from a nodal-line semimetal to a Weyl semimetal with a minimal number of Weyl nodes. Crucially, the Weyl nodes with opposite chirality are separated in energy, a key requirement for a non-zero GME. Using first-principles calculations combined with Floquet theory, we identify compressed black phosphorus as an ideal material platform. The intrinsic anisotropy of black phosphorus amplifies the GME, resulting in a measurable gyrotropic current that is several orders of magnitude larger than that in previously proposed systems. Our work not only provides a concrete path toward the experimental realization of GME but also opens new avenues for exploring the interplay of light, symmetry, and topology in quantum materials.

Abstract: We propose twisted bilayers of certain group IV and IVB trigonal transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MX$_{2}$ (M$=$Zr, Hf, Sn and X$=$S, Se) as moir\'{e} materials. In monolayer form these TMDs have conduction band minima near the three inequivalent Brillouin zone $M$ points and negligible spin-orbit coupling, implying six flavors of low-energy conduction band states. The flavor sectors decouple at the single-particle level and in twisted bilayers are accurately described by emergent moir\'e-periodic Hamiltonians that we derive from small-unit-cell density functional theory calculations. Because the valley-projected Hamiltonians have large valley-dependent mass anisotropies and are time-reversal invariant, spontaneous valley polarization is signaled in transport by anisotropy instead of by the anomalous Hall and magnetic circular dichroism signals commonly observed in graphene and $K$-valley TMD-based moir\'{e} multilayers.

Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.

Abstract: Topological matter offers opportunities for control of charge and energy flow with implications for chemistry still incompletely understood. In this work, we study an ensemble of adsorbates with an empty frontier level (LUMO) coupled to the edges, domain walls (solitons), and bulk of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger polyacetylene chain across its trivial insulator, metallic, and topological insulator phases. We find that two experimentally relevant observables, charge donation into the LUMO and the magnitude of adsorbate electronic friction, are significantly impacted by the electronic phase of the SSH chain and show clear signatures of the topological phase transition. Localized, symmetry-protected midgap states at edges and solitons strongly enhance electron donation relative to both the metallic and trivial phases, whereas by contrast, the metal's extended states, despite larger total DOS near the Fermi energy, hybridize more weakly with a molecular adsorbate near a particular site. Electronic friction is largest in the metal, strongly suppressed in gapped regions, and intermediate at topological edges where hybridization splits the midgap resonance. These trends persist with disorder highlighting their robustness and suggest engineering domain walls and topological boundaries as pathways for employing topological matter in molecular catalysis and sensing.

Abstract: Altermagnets with nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, nonferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308%, TER of 707%, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. The transport performance is robust under bias voltage. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic sensing, and quantum logic nanodevices.

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in layered nickelates under pressure has recently triggered enormous interest. Studies of these compounds have revealed a density-wave-like transition at ambient pressure, though its connection with superconductivity is still not well understood. Here, we report a detailed \msr\ study on single crystals of trilayer nickelate \LNO\ at ambient pressure. We have identified a spin-density-wave (SDW) transition at the temperature of $T_\mathrm{N} \sim$130 K, as well as a broad crossover around 70 - 100 K. Based on the temperature dependence of the muon precession amplitudes and magnetic susceptibility, we attribute this additional crossover either to a spin reorientation, or to an inhomogeneous SDW ordering.

Abstract: A periodic lattice distortion that reduces the translational symmetry folds electron bands into a reduced Brillouin zone, leading to band mixing and a tendency to gap formation, as in the Peierls transition in one-dimensional systems. However, in higher dimensions, the resulting phase can present topological obstructions preventing a complete gap opening. We discuss two different mechanisms for such obstructions, emergent Weyl nodes and symmetry protected band crossings. Based on density-functional calculations, we show these mechanisms are at play in trigonal PtBi$_2$.

Abstract: The trigonal Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$ presents an intriguing superconducting phase, previously reported to be confined to its topological Fermi arcs within a certain temperature range. This observation highlights the importance of a thorough understanding of its normal phase, particularly the roles that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and inversion-symmetry breaking play in shaping its band structure. Our density-functional theory calculations reveal that the semimetallic nature of trigonal PtBi$_2$ can be interpreted as stemming from a noncentrosymmetric crystal distortion of a parent structure that drives a metal-to-semimetal transition. This distortion breaks inversion symmetry and, crucially, reduces translational symmetry. Due to its interplay with translational symmetry, inversion-symmetry breaking emerges as the dominant energy scale producing substantial asymmetries ($\sim$ 0.6\,eV) in certain short-range hopping amplitudes, superseding the effects of SOC, whose primary role is to define the characteristics of the low-energy nodal structure and of the topological Fermi arcs. This also applies to the formation of the Weyl nodes closest to the Fermi energy, which are found to exist even in the absence of SOC as a result of the orbital physics associated with the reduced translational symmetry.

Abstract: Strong coupling of light to a collective spin excitation in antiferromagnets gives rise to hybrid modes called magnon-polaritons. They are highly promising for data manipulation and transfer at terahertz rates, much faster than in the case of ferromagnetic magnon-polaritons, which operate at GHz frequencies. Yet, control of terahertz magnon-polaritons by the voltage, i.e. without ohmic dissipation losses, remains challenging. Here, we showcase the ability to remotely control antiferromagnetic magnon-polaritons at room temperature using an electric field by integrating a highly birefringent liquid crystal layer into a terahertz Fabry-P\'erot cavity containing an antiferromagnetic crystal. Positioned several millimeters from the magnetic material, the liquid crystal allows for electrical manipulation of the cavity's photonic environment by control of its dielectric constant. This adjustment, in turn, influences the extent of magnon dressing by cavity photons, thereby controlling the vacuum Rabi oscillations of the magnon resonance coupled to a particular cavity mode. Our approach enables reversible tuning of magnon-photon hybridization that can be triggered without direct electrical contact or alteration of the magnetic medium. These findings pave the way for voltage-programmable terahertz magnonic devices and open new avenues for noninvasive control strategies in spin-based information processing technologies.

Abstract: Characterizing and optimizing nanoscopic heat engines require an appropriate understanding of the interplay between power, efficiency, entropy production and fluctuations. Despite significant recent advancements, including linear stochastic thermodynamics and thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs), a complete scenario remains elusive. In this work, we give a further step by showing that, under certain common and general conditions, the heat engine regime can be characterized by the minima of power fluctuations and entropy production, which together delimit its optimal performance, achieved when these conditions are fully satisfied. Conversely, when these conditions are not strictly met, the occurrence of the minimum still approximately describes the system, suggesting a broader range of applicability. Contrasting with most of studies in which the system optimization is carried out solely taking into account the power and efficiency, we introduce a multi-objective optimization framework based on Pareto fronts, also considering the role of fluctuation and dissipation. Our results reveal a general trend: while simultaneous optimization over a few parameters typically yields convex Pareto fronts, these fronts become concave as more parameters are varied freely and non-conservative driving becomes significant. Illustrating our findings, we consider simple two and three state systems as well as richer collective systems, exhibiting novel aspects of optimizations and protocol phase transitions.

Abstract: We consider the spin rotationally invariant Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (CSL) in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry and explore symmetry constraints on possible conventional spin crystal states accessible via a direct transition. These constraints provide a framework to identify topological invariants of the magnetically ordered state. We show that the existence of a direct transition from a CSL requires a precise compatibility condition between the topological invariants of the ordered state and the anomaly of the CSL. The lattice symmetries also constrain the functional form of the low-energy theory to describe these transitions. This allows us to construct explicit Chern-Simons-matter field theories for the transition into a class of noncoplanar orders identified as candidates directly accessible from the CSL, including the octahedral spin crystal on the kagom\'e lattice, and the tetrahedral order on the triangular and honeycomb lattice. These transitions can either be described using coupled fractionalized $ \mathbb{CP}^1 $ theories or fractionalized matrix principal chiral models. We also discuss extensions to more general magnetic ordering transitions out of the CSL.

Abstract: In magnetic topological insulators, a phase transition between a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) and an Anderson localization phase can be triggered by the rotation of an applied magnetic field. Without the scattering paths along magnetic domains, this phase transition is governed by scattering induced by nonmagnetic disorder. We show that the QAH phase is strikingly robust in the presence of spatially uncorrelated disorder. The robustness is attributed to the quantum confinement induced by the short correlation length of the disorder. The critical behavior near the phase transition suggests a picture distinct from quantum percolation. This provides new insights on the robustness of the QAH effect in magnetic topological insulators with atomic defects, impurities, and dopants.

Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.

Abstract: Experimental results for a huge number of different materials published during the past fifty years confirm the validity of the Jonscher's Universal Dielectric Response Law. Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Ghosh - Pan Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed.

Abstract: Nonequilibrium condensates of bosons subject to energy pump and dissipation are investigated, manifesting the Fr\"ohlich coherence proposed in 1968. A quantum theory is developed to capture such a nonequilibrium nature, yielding a certain graphic structure arising from the detailed-balance breaking. The results show a network of probability curl fluxes that reveals a graph topology. The winding number associated with the flux network is thus identified as a new order parameter for the phase transition towards the Fr\"ohlich condensation (FC), not attainable by the symmetry breaking. Our work demonstrates a global property of the FCs, in significant conjunction with the coherence of cavity polaritons that may exhibit robust cooperative phases driven far from equilibrium.

Abstract: Spin splitting in emerging altermagnets is non-relativistic and momentum-dependent, yet energy-independent, and localized in momentum space, posing challenges for practical applications. Here, we propose an intercalation-driven paradigm for altermagnets to attain ameliorative electronic structures, multiferroic characteristics, and anomalous and spin transport functionalities. As a representative system, we investigate electrochemistry- and self-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers, building on the recently reported room-temperature K- and Rb-intercalated V2Se2O family [Nat. Phys. 2025, 21, 754; Nat. Phys. 2025, 21, 760], utilizing density functional theory, Wannier function analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, and non-equilibrium Green function methods. Intercalation induces room-temperature intralayer ferrimagnetic and interlayer ferromagnetic order (358 K for Li-intercalation and 773 K for V-intercalation), ferroelasticity (~1 % signal intensity), in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and metallization, while also modifying the anomalous Hall effect. Notably, Li- and V-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers exhibit enhanced spin splitting and half-metallic behavior, respectively, yielding near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Intercalation substantially enhances spin transport in V2Se2O-based devices, enabling giant magnetoresistance (877 %), ultra-high thermal tunneling magnetoresistance (~12000 %), and observable spin Seebeck and temperature negative differential resistance effects. This intercalation-driven paradigm expands altermagnetic functionalities through multifunctional integration, offering promising avenues for advanced, miniaturized, room-temperature exploitation of anomalous, electron, and spin transport properties.

Abstract: In two- and higher-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices, systems can exhibit geometry-dependent bands, where the spectrum and eigenstates under open boundary conditions depend on the bulk geometry even in the thermodynamic limit. Although geometry-dependent bands are widely observed, the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon remains unclear. In this work, we address this problem by establishing a higher-dimensional non-Bloch band theory based on the concept of "strip generalized Brillouin zones" (SGBZs), which describe the asymptotic behavior of non-Hermitian bands when a lattice is extended sequentially along its linearly independent axes. Within this framework, we demonstrate that geometry-dependent bands arise from the incompatibility of SGBZs and, for the first time, derive a general criterion for the geometry dependence of non-Hermitian bands: non-zero area of the complex energy spectrum or the imaginary momentum spectrum. Our work opens an avenue for future studies on the interplay between geometric effects and non-Hermitian physics, such as non-Hermitian band topology.

Abstract: Adsorption processes play a fundamental role in molecular transport through nanofluidic systems, but their signatures in measured signals are often hard to distinguish from other processes like diffusion. In this paper, we derive an expression for the power spectral density (PSD) of particle number fluctuations in a channel, accounting for diffusion and adsorption/desorption to a wall. Our model, validated by Brownian dynamics simulations, is set in a minimal but adaptable geometry, allowing us to eliminate the effects of specific geometries. We identify distinct signatures in the PSD as a function of frequency $f$, including a $1/f^{3/2}$ scaling related to diffusive entrance/exit effects, and a $1/f^2$ scaling associated with adsorption. These scalings appear in key predicted quantities -- the total number of particles in the channel and the number of adsorbed or unadsorbed particles -- and can dominate or combine in non-trivial ways depending on parameter values. Notably, when there is a separation of timescales between diffusion inside the channel and adsorption/desorption times, the PSD can exhibit two distinct corners with well-separated slopes in some of the predicted quantities. We provide a strategy to identify adsorption and diffusion mechanisms in the shape of the PSD of experimental systems on the nano- and micro-scale, such as ion channels, nanopores, and electrochemical sensors, potentially offering insights into noisy experimental data.

Abstract: Anharmonic effects are widely believed to be the primary cause of the overestimation of superconducting transition temperatures of yttrium hydrides YH$_6$ and YH$_9$ in theoretical predictions. However, prior studies indicate that anharmonicity alone may be insufficient to account for this discrepancy. In this work, we employ the stochastic path-integral approach to investigate the quantum and anharmonic effects of ions in yttrium hydrides. Our calculations reveal significant corrections to the electron-phonon coupling parameters and an increase in the average phonon frequency compared to density functional perturbation theory, aligning closely with results from the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. We find that properly taking into account the renormalization of the Coulomb pseudopotential due to the frequency cutoff, which is often overlooked in previous calculations, is critical to predicting transition temperatures consistent with experimental values for both YH$_6$ and YH$_9$. This indicates that, with this correction, anharmonic effects are sufficient to explain the discrepancies between experimental and theoretical results.

Abstract: Accurate computational modeling of damage and fracture remains a central challenge in solid mechanics. The finite element method (FEM) is widely used for numerical modeling of fracture problems; however, classical damage models without gradient regularization yield mesh-dependent and usually inaccurate predictions. The use of gradient damage with FEM improves numerical robustness but introduces significant mathematical and numerical implementation complexities. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can encode the governing partial differential equations, boundary conditions, and constitutive models into the loss functions, offering a new method for fracture modeling. Prior applications of PINNs have been limited to small-strain problems and have incorporated gradient damage formulation without a critical evaluation of its necessity. Since PINNs in their basic form are meshless, this work presents a PINN framework for modeling fracture in elastomers undergoing large deformation without the gradient damage formulation. The PINN implementation here does not require training data and utilizes the collocation method to formulate physics-informed loss functions. We have validated the PINN's predictions for various defect configurations using benchmark solutions obtained from FEM with gradient damage formulation. The crack paths obtained using the PINN are approximately insensitive to the collocation point distribution. This study offers new insights into the feasibility of using PINNs without gradient damage and suggests a simplified and efficient computational modeling strategy for fracture problems. The PINN's performance has been evaluated through systematic variations in key neural network parameters to provide an assessment and guidance for future applications. The results motivate the extension of PINN-based approaches to a broader class of materials and damage models in mechanics.

Abstract: The Hubbard model in the $U\to\infty$ limit has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. The two results were obtained by different approaches which do not apply to one another. We make the first step towards unifying them by studying the quasi-1D lattice of a pyrochlore stripe, where all corners are not shared between two tetrahedra, and the valence bond configurations are not fixed by the location of the vacancy. The energy level ordering of irreducible representations of each tetrahedron shows that a chain of them has exponentially degenerate partial RVB or dimer-monomer ground states where each tetrahedron hosts one spin-$1/2$ monomer and one spin-$0$ dimer. The exact ground states in the infinitely long chain limit are analytically solved by introducing basis transformations between local Hilbert spaces of neighboring tetrahedra, and its energy agrees with the extrapolation of numerical exact diagonalization results of finite sized systems.

Abstract: The study of many-body localized (MBL) phases intrinsically links spectral properties with eigenstate characteristics: localized systems exhibit Poisson level statistics and area-law entanglement entropy, while ergodic systems display volume-law entanglement and follow random matrix theory predictions, including level repulsion. Here, we introduce the interacting Anderson Quantum Sun model, which significantly deviates from these conventional expectations. In addition to standard localized and ergodic phases, we identify a regime that exhibits volume-law entanglement coexisting with intermediate spectral statistics. We also identify another nonstandard regime marked by Poisson level statistics, sub-volume entanglement growth, and rare-event-dominated correlations, indicative of emerging ergodic instabilities. These results highlight unconventional routes of ergodicity breaking and offer fresh perspectives on how Anderson localization may be destabilized.

Abstract: In contrast to the neatly bounded spectra of densely populated large random matrices, sparse random matrices often exhibit unbounded eigenvalue tails on the real and imaginary axis, called Lifshitz tails. In the case of asymmetric matrices, concise mathematical results have proved elusive. In this work, we present an analytical approach to characterising these tails. We exploit the fact that eigenvalues in the tail region have corresponding eigenvectors that are exponentially localised on highly-connected hubs of the network associated to the random matrix. We approximate these eigenvectors using a series expansion in the inverse connectivity of the hub, where successive terms in the series take into account further sets of next-nearest neighbours. By considering the ensemble of such hubs, we are able to characterise the eigenvalue density and the extent of localisation in the tails of the spectrum in a general fashion. As such, we classify a number of different asymptotic behaviours in the Lifshitz tails, as well as the leading eigenvalue and the inverse participation ratio. We demonstrate how an interplay between matrix asymmetry, network structure, and the edge-weight distribution leads to the variety of observed behaviours.

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field and, in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.

Abstract: We demonstrate that applying modest magnetic fields during high-temperature crystal growth can profoundly alter the structure and ground state of a spin-orbit-coupled, antiferromagnetic trimer lattice. Using BaIrO3 as a model system, whose ground state is intricately dictated by the trimer lattice, we show that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a structurally compressed, metastable metallic and magnetically suppressed phases inaccessible via conventional methods. These effects include a 0.85% reduction in unit cell, 4-order-of-magnitude decrease in resistivity, a 10-fold enhancement of the Sommerfeld coefficient, and the collapse of long-range magnetic order -- all intrinsic and bulk in origin. First-principles calculations confirm that the field-stabilized structure lies substantially above the ground state in energy, highlighting its metastable character. These large, coherent and correlated changes across multiple bulk properties, unlike those caused by dilute impurities, defects or off-stoichiometry, point to an intrinsic field-induced mechanism. The findings establish magneto-synthesis as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.

Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the \qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.

Abstract: The interaction of highly-charged ions with monolayers of graphene and MoS2 is theoretically investigated based on nonequilibrium Green Functions (NEGF). In a recent paper [Niggas et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 086802 (2022)] dramatic differences in the response of the two materials to an impacting slow ion were reported. Here, this analysis is extended, focusing on the effect of electron-electron correlations in the monolayer on the electronic response to the ion. We apply the recently developed time-linear G1-G2 scheme [Schluenzen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 076601 (2020)] combined with an embedding approach [Balzer et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 155141 (2023)]. We demonstrate that, while electronic correlations have a minor effect in graphene, they significantly influence the electron dynamics in the case of MoS2. Our key results are the ultrafast dynamics of the charge density and induced electrostatic potential in the vicinity of the impact point of the ion.

Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets. Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies, hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data, effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation. Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural descriptors and material properties.

Abstract: Infinite-layer (IL) nickelates have rapidly emerged as a new class of superconductors. However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties in IL nickelates.

Abstract: A comprehensive experimental and physics informed neural network numerical inverse diffusion analysis is conducted in technologically important NiAlTi ternary and NiCoFeAlTi quinary solid solutions for estimating and extracting composition dependent diffusion coefficients. A systematic variation of tracer, intrinsic and interdiffusion coefficients with composition could be estimated in the ternary solid solution. Following, the possibility of producing Al Ti constant PB diffusion profiles keeping constant Ni, Co, Fe in the quinary system is demonstrated. The estimation of diffusion coefficients of all the elements at the Kirkendall marker plane of a single diffusion couple profile is elaborated. PINN optimisation parameters are established using self and impurity diffusion coefficients in Ni and tracer diffusion coefficients at the Kirkendall marker plane. The reliability of optimized parameters is validated by comparing with the interdiffusion coefficients estimated from binary NiTi, NiAl and PB diffusion profiles, indicating extendibility to even lower order systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment, which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based quantum processors fidelity.

Abstract: We review five years of experimental and theoretical attempts (2020-2025) to enhance the superconducting critical temperature ($\textit{T$_c$}$) of hydrogen-rich compounds by alloying binary superhydrides with additional elements. Despite predictions of higher $\textit{T$_c$}$ in ternary systems such as La-Y-H, La-Ce-H, and Ca-Mg-H, experiments consistently show that the maximum $\textit{T$_c$}$ in disordered ternary superhydrides does not exceed that of the best binary parent hydrides within experimental uncertainty. Instead, alloying primarily stabilizes high-symmetry polyhydride phases at lower pressures, enabling $\textit{T$_c$}$ = 200 K near 110-120 GPa, while also improving vortex pinning and upper critical fields. Magnetic dopants suppress $\textit{T$_c$}$, whereas nonmagnetic additives leave it nearly unchanged, reminiscent of Anderson's theorem. These findings indicate that alloying is unlikely to raise $\textit{T$_c$}$, but can reduce the pressures required to stabilize high-$\textit{T$_c$}$ phases. We propose that fully ordered ternary hydrides, synthesized via controlled hydrogenation of intermetallic precursors, offer a promising route toward this goal. One of the most promising compounds of this kind is the recently discovered LaSc$_2$H$_{24}$.

Abstract: Localized $5d^2$ electrons in a cubic crystal field possess multipoles such as electric quadrupoles and magnetic octupoles. We studied the cubic double perovskite Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$ containing the Os$^{6+}$ ($5d^2$) ions, which exhibits a phase transition to a `hidden order' below $T^* \sim$ 50 K, by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Os $L_{2,3}$ edge. The cubic ligand-field splitting between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ levels of Os $5d$ was deduced by XAS to be $\sim$4 eV. The temperature dependence of the XMCD spectra was consistent with a $\sim$18 meV residual cubic splitting of the lowest $J_{\rm eff} =$ 2 multiplet state into the non-Kramers $E_g$ doublet ground state and the $T_{2g}$ triplet excited state. Ligand-field (LF) multiplet calculation under fictitious strong magnetic fields indicated that the exchange interaction between nearest-neighbor octupoles should be as strong as $\sim$1.5 meV if a ferro-octupole order is stabilized in the `hidden-ordered' state, consistent with the exchange interaction of $\sim$1 meV previously predicted theoretically using model and density functional theory calculations.

Abstract: We study magnon-plasmon coupling in effectively two-dimensional stacks of van der Waals layers in the context of the band structure topology. Invoking the quasiparticle approximation, we show that the magnetic dipole coupling between the plasmons in a metallic layer and the magnons in a neighboring magnetic layer gives rise to a Berry curvature. As a result, the hybrid quasiparticles acquire an anomalous velocity, leading to intrinsic anomalous thermal Hall and spin-Nernst effects in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We propose magnetic layers supporting skyrmion crystals as a platform to realize chiral magnon-plasmon edge states, inviting the notion of topological magnon-plasmonics.

Abstract: Atomistic simulation methods have evolved through successive computational levels, each building upon more fundamental approaches: from quantum mechanics to density functional theory (DFT), and subsequently, to machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While universal MLIPs (u-MLIPs) offer broad transferability, their computational overhead limits large-scale applications. Task-specific MLIPs (ts-MLIPs) achieve superior efficiency but require prohibitively expensive DFT data generation for each material system. In this paper, we propose LightPFP, a data-efficient knowledge distillation framework. Instead of using costly DFT calculations, LightPFP generates a distilled ts-MLIP by leveraging u-MLIP to generate high-quality training data tailored for specific materials and utilizing a pre-trained light-weight MLIP to further enhance data efficiency. Across a broad spectrum of materials, including solid-state electrolytes, high-entropy alloys, and reactive ionic systems, LightPFP delivers three orders of magnitude faster model development than conventional DFT-based methods, while maintaining accuracy on par with first-principles predictions. Moreover, the distilled ts-MLIPs further sustain the computational efficiency essential for large-scale molecular dynamics, achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude faster inference than u-MLIPs. The framework further enables efficient precision transfer learning, where systematic errors from the u-MLIP can be corrected using as few as 10 high-accuracy DFT data points, as demonstrated for MgO melting point prediction. This u-MLIP-driven distillation approach enables rapid development of high-fidelity, efficient MLIPs for materials science applications.

Abstract: We demonstrate that frustrated spin textures can generate anisotropic Josephson couplings between $d$-vectors that can stabilize spatially varying pairing orders in spin triplet superconductors. These couplings depend on the relative orientation of $d$-vectors, analogous to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and $\Gamma$-type interactions in magnetism, leading to an effective "pliability" of the pairing order that competes with superfluid stiffness. Such couplings cannot originate from spin-orbit coupling; rather, they can arise, for example, when itinerant electrons are coupled to a local exchange field composed of frustrated spin moments. Using a $T$-matrix expansion, we show that coupling to a local exchange field leads to an effective tunneling of itinerant electrons that is dependent on the underlying spin configurations at the barrier between superconducting grains. Furthermore, Josephson tunneling through frustrated spin textures can produce a Josephson diode effect. The diode effect originates either from nonvanishing spin chirality in the barrier, or from antisymmetric Josephson coupling between noncollinear $d$-vectors, both of which break inversion and time-reversal symmetries.

Abstract: This work presents a model for characterizing porous, deformable media embedded with magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These active fluids exhibit tunable mechanical and rheological properties that can be controlled through the application of a magnetic field, which induces a phase transition from a liquid to a solid-like state. This transition profoundly affects both stress transmission and fluid flow within the composite, leading to a behaviour governed by a well-defined threshold that depends on the ratio between the pore size and the characteristic size of clusters of magnetic particles, and can be triggered by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. These effects were confirmed through an experimental campaign conducted on a prototype composite obtained by imbibing a selected MRF into commercial sponges. To design and optimize this new class of materials, a linear poroelastic formulation is proposed and validated through comparison with experimental results. The constitutive relationships, i.e. overall elastic constitutive tensor and permeability, of the model are updated from phenomenological observations, exploiting the experimental data obtained for both the pure fluid and the composite material. The findings demonstrate that the proposed simplified formulation is sufficiently robust to predict and optimize the behaviour of porous media containing MRFs. Such materials hold significant promise for a wide range of engineering applications, including adaptive exosuits for human tissue and joint rehabilitation, as well as innovative structural systems.

Abstract: Perovskite materials, known for their structural versatility and multifunctional properties, continue to draw interest for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications. In this study, we investigate the elastic and strain--engineered mechanical, electronic properties and optical properties of the orthorhombic La2AlGaO6 (LAGO) hybrid perovskite using first--principles quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Structural optimizations were performed using both the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The mechanical stability of LAGO was confirmed through the Born--Huang criteria, and key elastic constants (C11, C12, C33, C44, and C66) were evaluated. These constants were further used to derive mechanical parameters such as Young's modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, Cauchy's pressure, and anisotropic factor, offering insights into the material's ductility, hardness, and elastic anisotropy. Crucially, we explored the influence of biaxial strain on the electronic band structure, DOS/PDOS, and Fermi energy, revealing significant band gap modulation under compressive and tensile strain, and hence, varying the optical properties. The coupling between elastic response and electronic structure highlights LAGO's potential for tunable device applications, where mechanical stimuli can be employed to tailor its electronic functionality.

Abstract: The phenomenological theory of martensite crystallography (PTMC) explains the main crystallographic and microstructural features of martensite in shape memory alloys, such as the transformation twins between the martensite variants, and the interfaces between austenite and martensite bi-variant laminates. It also permits to determine which austenite and martensite lattice parameters should be targeted to get supercompatibility, which has driven over the last decades important research and development of new shape memory alloys with low hysteresis and high cyclability. First, we show that the cofactor conditions generally used to define supercompatibility are not necessary because they are redundant with the invariant plane condition. Second, we develop an alternative to the PTMC, called correspondence theory (CT). The mathematical tools of the PTMC come from continuum mechanics (pole decompositions and stretch tensors); they are advantageously replaced here by pure crystallographic tools (metric tensors, group of symmetries and correspondence), which allow direct calculations of the transformation twins and their generic and non-generic characters. A new symmetric matrix, called compatibility of metrics by correspondence (CMC) is also introduced. The supercompatibility condition can now be understood and written as the degeneracy of a quadratic form of the CMC, or geometrically as the degeneracy of double-cone into a double-plane, a plane, or the full space.

In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.

Abstract: Mode fluctuations with a low damping are essential for quantum information and logic operations in magnonic devices. We probe the broadband nonlinear magnetization dynamics of a high-quality ferromagnet under a strong microwave drive using microwave spectroscopy. We observe an \textit{unexpected} Fano resonance in the microwave transmission when the driven amplitude of the magnetization is large and the drive frequency $\omega_d$ is close to but not at the ferromagnetic resonance. We interpret this Fano resonance by a scattering theory of photons considering the three-magnon interaction between the Kittel magnon and magnon pairs with opposite wave vectors of frequency $\omega_d/2$. The theoretical model suggests that the microwave spectroscopy measures the dynamics of the fluctuation $\delta \hat{\alpha}$ of the Kittel magnon and $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ of the magnon pairs over the driven steady states, which are coupled coherently by the steady-state amplitudes. With the damping of $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ much smaller than that of $\delta \hat{\alpha}$, the theoretical calculation well reproduces the observed Fano resonance, indicating the magnon pairs hold a recorded long lifetime.

Abstract: We propose and theoretically study minimal models of N\'{e}el ordered collinear antiferromagnets exhibiting the anomalous Hall effect. For simplicity, we consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. We provide explicit examples of a N\'{e}el ordered ferrimagnet and a Dzyaloshinskii weak ferromagnet. We analyze Turov's invariants for the existence of spontaneous magnetization in these N\'{e}el ordered systems. As a result, we find that the anomalous Hall effect is allowed only for specific directions of the N\'{e}el order, dictated by the crystal lattice symmetries. Microscopic calculations of the Berry curvature for the studied systems confirm the validity of these Turov's invariants. We show that the anomalous Hall effect mechanism in these antiferromagnets arises from the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the N\'{e}el order and the spin-orbit coupling, both originating from the broken symmetries that permit the Turov's invariant in the system.

Abstract: This work analyzes singular-value spectra of weight matrices in pretrained transformer models to understand how information is stored at both ends of the spectrum. Using Random Matrix Theory (RMT) as a zero information hypothesis, we associate agreement with RMT as evidence of randomness and deviations as evidence for learning. Surprisingly, we observe pronounced departures from RMT not only among the largest singular values -- the usual outliers -- but also among the smallest ones. A comparison of the associated singular vectors with the eigenvectors of the activation covariance matrices shows that there is considerable overlap wherever RMT is violated. Thus, significant directions in the data are captured by small singular values and their vectors as well as by the large ones. We confirm this empirically: zeroing out the singular values that deviate from RMT raises language-model perplexity far more than removing values from the bulk, and after fine-tuning the smallest decile can be the third most influential part of the spectrum. To explain how vectors linked to small singular values can carry more information than those linked to larger values, we propose a linear random-matrix model. Our findings highlight the overlooked importance of the low end of the spectrum and provide theoretical and practical guidance for SVD-based pruning and compression of large language models.

Abstract: We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a loss function that enforces the Schr\"odinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics and enables bounding the error with the exact evolution via the global loss function. We showcase the method by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D, uncovering signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, our method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches, while unlocking previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.

Abstract: This review consolidates experimental, theoretical, and simulation work examining the behavior of high-field devices and the fundamental process of vacuum arc initiation, commonly referred to as breakdown. Detailed experimental observations and results relating to a wide range of aspects of high-field devices, including conditioning, field and temperature dependence of breakdown rate, and the ability to sustain high electric fields as a function of device geometry and materials, are presented. The different observations are then addressed theoretically, and with simulation, capturing the sequence of processes that lead to vacuum breakdown and explaining the major observed experimental dependencies. The core of the work described in this review was carried out by a broad multi-disciplinary collaboration in an over a decade-long program to develop high-gradient, 100 MV/m-range, accelerating structures for the CLIC project, a possible future linear-collider high-energy physics facility. Connections are made to the broader linear collider, high-field, and breakdown communities.

arXiv:2503.19183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of cosmological particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics through the lens of entanglement. We use the entanglement contour (EC) to analyse the spatio-temporal structure of particle production, showing that a quasi-particle picture for the EC captures the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifests through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement.

Abstract: We study electric-magnetic duality in Lorentz invariant symmetric tensor gauge theories, where immobile charged particles - fractons - arise due to the generalized current conservation $\partial_{\mu} \partial_{\nu} J^{\mu \nu} = 0$ and the fracton gauge principle. We show that the duality in the symmetric gauge theories holds only in four-dimensional spacetime. In higher dimensions, the duality does not hold with only the symmetric gauge fields but tensor fields with more complex symmetries come into play. Furthermore, we show that a hierarchy for the symmetric gauge field theories of higher ranks is interpreted by the bi-form calculus. We also discuss the restricted immobility of $p$-branes in the mixed symmetric gauge theories. As a byproduct, we find that novel self-duality conditions are defined as BPS equations in the four-dimensional Euclidean space.

Abstract: Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.

Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez

arXiv:2506.21447v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.

Abstract: Spin glasses are fundamental probability distributions at the core of statistical physics, the theory of average-case computational complexity, and modern high-dimensional statistical inference. In the mean-field setting, we design deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithms for estimating the partition function to arbitrarily high accuracy for all inverse temperatures in the second moment regime. In particular, for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, our algorithms succeed for the entire replica-symmetric phase. To achieve this, we study the locations of the zeros of the partition function. Notably, our methods are conceptually simple, and apply equally well to the spherical case and the case of Ising spins.

arXiv:2508.20854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-dimensional classical O($N$) model with a boundary has received renewed interest due to the discovery of the extraordinary-log boundary universality class for $2\leq N< N_\text{c}$. The critical value $N_c$ and the exponent of the boundary correlation function are related to certain amplitudes in the normal universality class. To determine their precise values, we revisit the 3d O($N$) boundary conformal field theory for $N=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. After substantially improving the accuracy of the boundary bootstrap, our determinations are in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo results, resolving the previous discrepancies due to low truncation orders. We also use the recent bulk bootstrap results to deduce highly accurate Ising data. Many bulk and boundary predictions are obtained for the first time. Our results demonstrate the great potential of the $\eta$ minimization method for many unexplored bootstrap problems in which positivity constraints are absent.

Antoine Marie, Pierre-Fran\c{c}ois Loos

arXiv:2509.03253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation has become a method of choice for predicting quasiparticle properties in solids and large molecular systems, owing to its favorable accuracy-cost balance. However, its accuracy is the result of a fortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and self-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of vertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is disrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically goes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a single correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the particle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all two-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal structure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function, the self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations necessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of this approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its accuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems.

arXiv:2509.09173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmons facilitate a strong confinement and enhancement of near-field light, offering exciting opportunities to enhance nonlinear optical responses at the nanoscale. However, despite significant advancements, the electrically tunable range of the nonlinear optical responses at nanometer-scale plasmonic structures remains limited to a few percents per volt. Here, we transcend the limitation of the nanometer regime by expanding the concept of electrophotonics into angstrom-scale platform, enabling high-performance modulation of near-field nonlinear optical responses inaccessible in prior architectures. We demonstrate ~2000% enhancement in second-harmonic generation (SHG) within 1 V of voltage application by utilizing an angstrom-scale plasmonic gap between a metallic tip and a flat metal substrate in a scanning tunneling microscope. Extending this near-field SHG scheme to sum-frequency generation that is accompanied by large frequency upconversion, we also found that such giant electrical modulation of plasmon-enhanced nonlinear optical phenomena is effective over mid-infrared to visible broad wavelength range. Our results and concepts lay the foundation for developing near-field-based angstrom-scale nonlinear electrophotonics with significant modulation depth at low driving voltage.

arXiv:2510.23583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments identify pole-skipping as a `smoking-gun' signature of the hydrodynamic nature of chaos, offering an alternative way to probe quantum chaos in addition to the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). We study the quantum chaos and pole-skipping phenomenon in the strongly coupled charged rotating fluids, holographically dual to rotating black holes with nontrivial gauge field. We find that the near-horizon equation governing energy-density fluctuations differs from the source-less shock wave equation determining the OTOC, which depends on the $U(1)$ gauge choice. This discrepancy is eliminated under an appropriate boundary condition on the $U(1)$ gauge potential at the event horizon, as required by the vanishing of Wilson loop at the Euclidean horizon. We further investigate the dependence of the butterfly velocity on the charge and rotation parameters in a specific black hole configuration--the Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope solution.

arXiv:2511.00325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate bound and scattering properties of a system of two neutral atoms and an ion near an atom-ion Feshbach resonance. Our results indicate that long-range atom-ion interactions lead to significant deviations from universal behavior derived from contact or van der Waals potentials. We find that ionic systems display an overall suppression of inelastic transitions leading to recombination rates and lifetimes of Efimov state orders of magnitude smaller with respect to those for neutral atoms. We further characterize the dense spectra of triatomic molecular ions with extended lifetimes. Our results provide a deeper insight on the universality and structure of three-body ionic systems and establishing them as a promising platform for exploring novel few- and many-body phenomena with long-range interactions.
