Abstract: Partially miscible bubble populations trapped in porous media are ubiquitous in subsurface applications such as underground hydrogen storage (UHS), where cyclic injections fragment gas into numerous bubbles with distributions of sizes and compositions. These bubbles exchange mass through Ostwald ripening, driven by differences in composition and interfacial curvature. While kinetic theories have been developed for single-component ripening in porous media, accounting for bubble deformation and spatial correlations in pore size, no such theory exists for multicomponent systems. We present the first kinetic theory for multicomponent Ostwald ripening of bubbles in porous media. The formulation describes the bubble population with a number-density function $g(s; t)$ in a 3D statistical space of bubble states $s = (R_p, S^b, y)$, consisting of pore size, bubble saturation, and composition. Evolution is governed by a population balance equation with closure through mean-field approximations that account for spatial correlations in pore size and ensure mass conservation. The theory generalizes previous single-component formulations, removing key limitations such as the inability to capture interactions between distant bubbles. Systematic validation against pore-network simulations across homogeneous, heterogeneous, correlated, and uncorrelated networks demonstrates good agreement without adjustable parameters. Pending challenges and limitations are discussed. Since the theory imposes no constraints on bubble count or correlation length, it enables predictions beyond the pore scale.

Abstract: Band flattening has been identified as key ingredient to correlation phenomena in Moir\'e materials and beyond. Here, we examine strongly repulsive fermions on a ladder -- a minimal platform for unconventional $d$-wave pairing -- and show that flattening of the lower band through an additional diagonal hopping term produces non-Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by the violation of Luttinger's theorem, as well as axial $d$-wave pairing correlations. Alternatively, plaquette ring exchange can also generate pairing, albeit with a distinct diagonal $d$-wave pairing symmetry. Hence, our finding showcases a competition of different unconventional pairing channels, and demonstrates via a simple model how band geometry can induce fermionic pairing. This offers broadly relevant insights for correlated flat-band systems, ranging from ultracold atoms to strongly interacting electrons in solids.

Abstract: Atomic cells made by anodically bonding silicon and borosilicate glasses are widely used in atomic devices.
  One inherent problem in these cells is that the silicon material blocks beams with wavelengths shorter than
  1000 nm, which limits available optical accesses when alkali metal atoms are involved. In this work, we
  investigate the possibility of the silicon carbide material as an alternative of silicon materials in fabricating
  anodically bonded cells. We demonstrate that the optical, thermal and mechanical properties of silicon carbide
  help to improve the performance of atomic devices in certain applications.

arXiv:2512.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of inter-defect interaction on the defect thermodynamics, local structure, and oxidation of acceptor-doped wide-gap ABO3 perovskites are explored using the developed statistical theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that under realistic energy parameters the interaction between oxygen vacancies and impurities generally has a greater impact on the studied properties than inter-vacancy correlations. The influence of inter-vacancy interaction significantly depends on dopant content x: inter-site vacancy repulsion becomes noticeable at sufficiently high x, whereas on-site Fermi-type correlations can be pronounced within a narrow doping range at moderate x values. It is found that a non-uniform impurity allocation, which can result from a sample preparation procedure, considerably affects oxygen-vacancy distribution, and has a weaker effect on short-range order and oxidation. It is also shown that inter-defect interaction reduces the hole concentration, increases the oxidation enthalpy, and can result in their non-trivial dependence on x. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the fundamental properties of acceptor-doped oxides, facilitating the development of new materials for clean energy applications.

Hao Chen, Titus Neupert, Juraj Hasik

arXiv:2512.20697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.

Yang-Ren Liu, Biao Huang

arXiv:2512.20707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an analytical framework to calculate the values of key observables in a strongly disordered discrete time crystal (DTC) without fitting parameter. The perturbatively obtained closed-form formulae show quantitative agreement with numerical simulations of inverse participation ratios for eigenstate localization in Fock space, Edwards-Anderson parameters for spin-glass orders, mutual information for long-range entanglement, and the steady-state amplitudes of autocorrelators for period-doubled oscillations. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that eigenstate resonances render the scaling for the deviation of physical observables from their unperturbed values as $O(\lambda)$, in contrast to non-resonant situations with suppressed deviation $O(\lambda^2)$. Our scheme is based on the resolvent perturbation method that can directly prescribe arbitrarily higher-order corrections without iterations. With such advantages, we analytically prove that quasienergy corrections for pairwise cat eigenstates are identical up to order $O(\lambda^{(L/n_{\text{op}})-1})$, where perturbations of strength $\lambda$ involve at most $n_{\text{op}}$-spin terms. Such spectral pairing deviations quantify the DTC lifetime as $\tau_* \sim (1/\lambda)^{L/n_{\text{op}}}$. Our analytical scheme applies to generic DTC models with dominant Ising interaction and a given number of qubits, which allows for independent quantification of physical observables beyond the system size accessible to numerical simulations.

arXiv:2512.20709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion of particles in complex fluids and gels is difficult to describe and often lies beyond the scope of the classical Stokes-Einstein relation. One of the main lines of research over the past few decades has sought to relate diffusivity to a fundamental dissipative property of the fluid: the wave-vector-dependent shear viscosity function. Here, we use linear response theory to extend this viscosity function framework to rod-like particles. Using a dimer (two-bead particle) as a minimal rod-like probe, we derive explicit expressions for its diffusion coefficients parallel and perpendicular to its axis in terms of the viscosity function. We show that this description captures the full range of behaviors, from nearly isotropic diffusion of the rod-like probe to highly anisotropic, reptation-like motion. The method is based on a microscopic statistical-mechanical treatment of the Smoluchowski dynamics, yet leads to simple final formulas, providing a practical tool for interpreting diffusion experiments on rod-like tracers in complex fluids. We also clarify the limitations of this approach, emphasizing that the present formulation is primarily suited to complex liquids like polymer solutions and only indirectly applicable to gels.

arXiv:2512.20726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the formation of cyclical arms in star polymers, focusing on the effects of solvent quality on their resulting linking complexity and gyration radius. We find that polymers circularized in bad solvent present a higher degree of linking among arms with respect to those circularized in good solvent. When both are transported to good solvent, this results in a smaller gyration radius of the former with respect to the latter. This effect is magnified when the polymers present a sufficiently small number of arms (or functionality $f$): in this case, in bad solvent, all arms tend to clump together on one side of the central core, due to circularization, and can hence all interact with each other. Instead, when $f$ is large enough, the whole surface of the core is wetted by the arms, whose distribution becomes radially symmetric. This hinders interactions between faraway arms and reduces the probability of inter-arm linking. Interestingly, we find that both the critical $f_c$ at which the clump transition happens and the minimal arm length $n_c$ for which the transition appears depend on the core size: the grafting density of the arms must be larger than a certain constant $\rho_g^c$, while their length must be sufficient to stretch for, at least, half of the core's circumference.

Abstract: Organic mixed conductors (OMCs) represent a promising class of materials for applications in bioelectronics, physical computing, and thermoelectrics. Rather unparalleled, OMCs feature dynamics spanning multiple length and time scales, involving an intricate coupling between electronic, ionic, and mass transport. These characteristics set them notably apart from traditional semiconductors and hinder the description by conventional semiconductor theory. In this work, we approach the charge carrier modulation of OMCs using statistical mechanics. We discuss OMCs from a first-principles perspective and contrast them with established semiconductor materials, highlighting key differences in their collective charge carrier dynamics. This motivates our toy model describing OMCs as a lattice gas, which we analyze within the grand canonical ensemble. The model exhibits a first-order phase transition analogous to a classical vapor$\unicode{x2013}$liquid transition, governed by temperature and chemical potential. In doing so, it explains the formation of distinct low- and high-density carrier phases $\unicode{x2013}$ a mesoscale phenomenon recently observed experimentally. It also demonstrates how metastability near the phase boundary can give rise to history-dependent characteristics in device operation, a similarly well-reported effect in OMC transistors. This work is intended as a simple motivation for studying OMCs through the lens of statistical mechanics, offering a more natural description than traditional semiconductor models developed for materials of fundamentally distinct character.

Enrique Rozas Garcia, Johannes Hofmann

arXiv:2512.20734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a field-theoretical description of thermal nucleation in a one-dimensional ferromagnetic superfluid, a quantum-gas analogue of false-vacuum decay. The rate at which ground-state domains nucleate from fluctuations in the metastable phase follows an Arrhenius law, with an exponential factor determined by a saddle-point configuration of the energy functional -- the critical droplet -- and a magnitude fixed by small fluctuations of this configuration. We evaluate both contributions over the full parameter space, using a Gel'fand-Yaglom approach to reduce the calculation of the fluctuation spectrum to an initial value problem. In addition, we obtain a closed-form expression for the critical droplet in the limit of small potential tilts, and use it to formulate an effective theory of domain nucleation and growth as a Kramers escape problem for the droplet size. Our results determine the parametric dependence of the nucleation rate and its signature on experimental images of a nucleating gas, and should allow for a rigorous comparison between nucleation theory and experiment.

arXiv:2512.20752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled microparticles create flow fields that determine how they interact with surfaces, external flows, and each other. These flow fields fall into distinct classes--pushers, pullers, and neutral swimmers--each exhibiting fundamentally different collective behaviors. In all existing synthetic systems, this hydrodynamic character is permanently set during fabrication, making it impossible to explore how adaptive switching between these classes might enable new functions or emergent phenomena.
  Here we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic character of a microswimmer can be programmed and switched on demand. Using patterned laser heating of surface-bound nanoparticles, we create tailored temperature gradients that drive controllable boundary flows at the particle surface. By changing the illumination pattern in real time, we dynamically transform the swimmers flow field continuously tuning from pusher to puller, while the particle continues to swim. Flow measurements confirm quantitative agreement with theory and allow us to simultaneously track how symmetry, power consumption, and efficiency change across modes. This control over hydrodynamic modes opens experimental access to questions that have remained largely theoretical: How do adaptive swimmers respond to crowding or confinement? Can mixtures with tunable pusher-puller ratios reveal new collective states? Our approach provides a platform to address these questions and explore the morphological developments of active matter systems under external physical constraints.

Abstract: Silicon spin qubits offer long coherence times, a compact footprint and compatibility with industrial CMOS manufacturing. Here, we investigate spin qubits hosted in quantum dots fabricated in a state-of-the-art 300 mm nanoelectronics foundry and demonstrate substantially enhanced coherence, achieving a Hahn-echo time of $T_2^{\text{Hahn}} = 4\,\mathrm{ms}$ for singlet--triplet oscillations. Employing noise spectroscopy and noise correlation measurements, we identify detuning noise with an amplitude of $\delta \varepsilon_{\mathrm{rms}} = 2.2\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ (integrated over 90 s) and observe strong zero-phase correlations between two spatially separated spin qubits. The singlet--triplet basis intrinsically rejects these common-mode fluctuations, yielding a pronounced suppression of dephasing. Our results suggest that exploiting the versatility of silicon quantum dots to adapt the qubit encoding to the microscopic noise landscape represents a promising strategy for advancing scalable quantum information processing.

Abstract: Since the first evidence of luminescence of organic polymers in STM junctions, efforts have been invested in elucidating how to leverage the voltage, anchoring chemistry, and molecular structure to optimize emission power and efficiency. Understanding the fundamentals underlying current-driven molecular emission is important not only for OLED engineering, but also to control luminescence at the atomic scale toward the mastering of single or localized photon sources. However, the difficulty in isolating the separate roles of the variables at play in molecular junction experiments, has precluded a general comprehension of their distinctive effects on the emitted power and the quantum yield. In the present report, we use time-dependent electronic structure simulations based on quantum electrodynamics to disentangle the incidence of bias, electronic coupling and molecular length on device performance, with polyphenylene-vinylene as a case study. A careful validation demonstrates that our approach can achieve quantitative agreement with available experimental data. Through its application we identify the applied bias as the main factor determining emission power. The quantum efficiency, however, is influenced only minimally by bias and electronic coupling, and is instead dominated by polymer length, on which it depends exponentially. Thus, using longer polymer chains emerges as the primary strategy for achieving higher efficiencies. Our results thereby provide key prescriptions for designing single-molecule electroluminescent platforms.

Hongqin Liu

arXiv:2512.20792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential energy landscape, PEL, theory stands as one of the most successful frameworks for understanding supercooled liquids and glassy systems. A central element of this theory is the configurational entropy, Sc, which is traditionally represented by a symmetric Gaussian distribution. However, the asymmetric nature of the potential energy of inherent structures, Eis, poses a challenge to such a representation across wide regions of configurational space. In addition, the Gaussian distribution fails to represent fragile to strong transition, FST, observed in various fluids. In this work, we demonstrate that an asymmetric distribution, specifically the Gamma distribution, provides effective description of both Sc and Eis over broad ranges of density and temperature, T. The FST is interpreted through shifts of the Eis distribution and the curvature change of the Eis vs 1/T relation. In terms of energy changes, the FST is comparable to a liquid-liquid phase transition. Moreover, the revised PEL framework yields an equation of state that incorporates a singular term diverging at a glassy or jammed state, an important feature for accurately describing the pressure behavior of these systems.

arXiv:2512.20804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of SiC crystal growth using molecular dynamics (MD) have become popular in recent years. They, however, simulate very fast deposition rates, to reduce computational costs. Therefore, they are more akin to surface sputtering, leading to abnormal growth effects, including thick amorphous layers and large defect densities. A recently developed method, called the minimum energy atomic deposition (MEAD), tries to overcome this problem by depositing the atoms directly at the minimum energy positions, increasing the time scale.
  We apply the MEAD method to simulate SiC crystal growth on stepped C-terminated 4H substrates with 4{\deg} and 8{\deg} off-cut angle. We explore relevant calculations settings, such as amount of equilibration steps between depositions and influence of simulation cell sizes and bench mark different interatomic potentials. The carefully calibrated methodology is able to replicate the stable step-flow growth, which was so far not possible using conventional MD simulations. Furthermore, the simulated crystals are evaluated in terms of their dislocations, surface roughness and atom mobility. Our methodology paves the way for future high fidelity investigations of surface phenomena in crystal growth.

Abstract: Unintentionally formed interfacial layers are ubiquitous in semiconductor devices that operate at extreme conditions. However, these layers' structure and properties often remain unknown due to the thinness of these naturally formed interphases. Here, we report on the intentional epitaxial growth and semiconductor properties of NiGa2O4 spinel layers that form at Ga2O3/NiO interfaces used in high-power and high-temperature electronic devices. Cubic spinel NiGa2O4 films of 10-50 nm thicknesses and low surface roughness (~ 2 nm) were grown using pulsed laser deposition at a substrate temperatures in the 300-900 {\deg}C range on {\alpha}-Al2O3 and {\beta}-Ga2O3 substrates of different orientation. The optical absorption onset (3.6-3.9 eV) and thermal conductivity (4-9 W m-1 K-1) vary systematically with substrate temperature, consistent with theoretical predictions of varying Ni and Ga cation ordering on the spinel lattice. The valence band offset between NiGa2O4 and {\beta}-Ga2O3 is determined to be 1.8 eV. The NiGa2O4-based p-n heterojunction devices on Ga2O3 (001) substrates exhibit a rectification ratio of 10^8 (for +/-2V) and a turn-on voltage of 1.4 V, maintaining diode behavior up to 600 {\deg}C. These results highlight the potential of NiGa2O4 as a p-type interlayer in Ga2O3-based devices and shows a new approach to investigate such interfacial layers.

Abstract: We report the synthesis, structure and physical properties of a new quaternary nitride LaCr$_2$Ge$_2$N. The compound crystallizes in the CeCr$_2$Si$_2$C-type structure (P4/mmm), featuring distinctive Cr$_2$N square sheets within Cr$_2$Ge$_2$N block layers. Physical characterizations reveal enhanced electron correlations evidenced by a Sommerfeld coefficient substantially larger than band calculations and pressure-induced deviation from Fermi-liquid behavior. Magnetic measurements show short-range antiferromagnetic correlations developing around 460 K, followed by long-range magnetic ordering at 14 K. Additionally, subtle anomalies at 378 K suggest possible electronic ordering. First-principles calculations reveal nearly-flat Cr-3d bands near the Fermi level and predict a striped antiferromagnetic ground state. This work demonstrates how electron count variation in the CeCr$_2$Si$_2$C-type structure family leads to magnetic ordering in LaCr$_2$Ge$_2$N, contrasting with the paramagnetic behavior of LnCr$_2$Si$_2$C compounds.

Abstract: Ultrathin polymer-graphene heterostructures are promising materials for next generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic technologies, while the influence of the polymer's structural variation on interfacial charge transfer remains unclear. Here, using ab initio quantum mechanical calculations we show how different forms of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), a widely used organic semiconductor, interact with graphene. We analyze the effects of molecular chain length, end-group termination, periodicity, and the distinction between ordered and random P3HT arrangements. For isolated P3HT, the band gap decreases with increasing chain length and layer thickness, while structural disorder leads to slightly larger gaps due to reduced electronic coupling. When P3HT is deposited on graphene, all configurations exhibit spontaneous charge transfer, with electrons accumulating on graphene and holes remaining in the polymer. This effect is significantly enhanced in ordered and fully periodic structures and is noticeably weaker in disordered ones. Charge density analyses further show that thicker and more ordered P3HT layers improve electron hole separation across the interface. Our results reveal how molecular structure governs charge transfer in P3HT-graphene heterojunctions and provide practical guidelines for designing high efficiency polymer-graphene photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: Electronic scattering is a powerful tool to identify underlying changes in electronic behavior and incipient electronic and magnetic orders. The nematic and magnetic phases are strongly intertwined under applied pressure in FeSe, however, the additional isoelectronic substitution of sulphur offers an elegant way to separate them. Here we report the detailed evolution of the electronic and superconducting behaviour of FeSe$_{0.96}$S$_{0.04}$ under applied pressure via longitudinal magnetoresistance studies up to 15T. At intermediate pressures, inside the nematic phase, the resistivity displays an upturn in zero magnetic field, which is significantly enhanced in the magnetic field, suggesting the stabilization of a spin-density wave phase, which competes with superconductivity. At higher pressures, beyond the nematic phase boundaries, the resistivity no longer displays any clear anomalies in the zero magnetic field, but an external magnetic field induces significant upturns in resistivity reflecting a field-induced order, where superconductivity and magnetic anomalies are enhanced in tandem. This study highlights the essential role of high magnetic fields in stabilizing different electronic phases and revealing a complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity tuned by applied pressure in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$.

Abstract: Quantized charge pumping in one-dimensional chiral wires has been widely studied in the context of topological physics in a (1+1)-dimensional synthetic space, yet the role of orbital and spin degrees of freedom in such topological pumps remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine how the topologically quantized charge pump in insulators generates spin polarizations, and assess whether this mechanism may offer distinct insight into the widely known spin-selective transport in chiral wires-commonly referred to as chirality-induced spin selectivity. We performed time-dependent Schrodinger equations of multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians driven by a circularly polarized electric field. Our main findings are twofold. First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality. On the analogy between the synthetic (1+1)- and 2-dimensional topological insulators, we suggest that non-trivial spin-orbital dynamics may accompany the anomalous quantum charge Hall states of even-dimensional real materials.

Abstract: Using the recently proposed bond-operator technique (BOT), we discuss spin dynamics of the Heisenberg spin-$\frac12$ antiferromagnet with the ring exchange and small interactions between the second- and the third-neighbor spins on the square lattice at $T=0$. This model was suggested before for description of parent compounds of high-temperature superconducting layered cuprates. BOT describes accurately short-range spin correlations in quantum systems and provides a quantitative description of elementary excitations which appear in other approaches as bound states of conventional low-energy quasiparticles. We demonstrate that besides well-known magnons (spin-1 excitations) there are three well-defined spin-0 quasiparticles in the considered model whose energies lie near the magnon spectrum. Two of them, the amplitude (Higgs) mode and the quasiparticle which we named singlon, produce pronounced anomalies observed experimentally in the Raman scattering, resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, and infrared optical absorption. We find sets of the model parameters which describe quantitatively experimental data obtained in $\rm La_2CuO_4$ and $\rm Sr_2CuO_2Cl_2$.

Abstract: Emergent behavior,which arises from local interactions between simple elements,is pervasive in nature. It underlies the exceptional energy-efficient computing in our brains. However,realizing such dynamics in artificial materials, particularly under low-energy stimuli, remains a fundamental challenge.Here we harness and amplify them to construct a strongly dipolar-coupled network of SmCo5 macrospins at wafer scale, which can exhibit intrinsic interaction-driven collective dynamics in response to voltage pulses. The network combines three essential ingredients,i.e.strong dipolar coupling enabled by large single-domain macrospin, giant voltage control of coercivity over nearly 1000-fold, the largest reported to date, and a disordered network topology with frustrated Ising-like energy landscape. When stimulated by 1 V pulses, the network enters a regime where interaction-driven magnetic behaviors emerge, including spontaneous demagnetization, greatly enhanced magnetization modulation, reversible freeze and resume evolution and stochastic convergence toward low-energy magnetic configurations. All these behaviors are completely absent at the single-nanomagnet level. Furthermore, by constructing micromagnetic models of the strongly dipolar-coupled macrospin networks calibrated to experiments, we show that the resulting nonlinear, high-dimensional collective dynamics, which are characteristic of strongly-interacting systems, can enable accurate chaotic Mackey-Glass prediction and multiclass drone-signal classification. Our work establishes the voltage-responsive strongly-coupled SmCo5 network as a mesoscopic platform for probing emergent magnetic dynamics previously inaccessible under ambient conditions.It also suggests a fundamental distinct route towards scalable,low-voltage computing, one rooted in native physical interaction-driven collective dynamics at the network level.

Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the spin-1 Kitaev--Heisenberg chain in the presence of uniaxial single-ion anisotropy (SIA) $D_z$ by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. By combining energy-curvature diagnostics on periodic $N=24$ clusters with a refined characterization based on order parameters and correlation functions for open chains up to $N=144$, we establish a comprehensive phase diagram in the $\phi$--$D_z$ plane. We identify four magnetically ordered phases -- FM-$z$, FM-$xy$, N\'eel-$z$, and a two-sublattice collinear LLRR2 state -- as well as magnetically disordered/critical regimes including N\'eel-$xy$, LLRR1, and two Kitaev spin-liquid (KSL) regions. A topological Haldane phase also emerges near the Heisenberg limit. Our results provide evidence that both AFM- and FM-KSL regimes acquire finite parameter widths in the spin-1 model, while the Haldane phase is fragile against Kitaev-type anisotropy, particularly for $D_z<0$. Increasing (decreasing) $D_z$ suppresses (enhances) magnetic order and expands (shrinks) the KSL and other magnetically disordered sectors. Also, at $D_z=0$, we identify an exactly solvable point at $\phi=\tan^{-1}(-2)$, which enforces a first-order transition between N\'eel-$z$ and LLRR2. We further contrast these findings with the spin-$1/2$ KH chain and with the spin-1 honeycomb KH model, highlighting the distinct roles of dimensionality and SIA in Kitaev-type magnets.

Abstract: The layered van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS) exhibits unique cation hopping-driven phenomena that bring about unconventional properties with intriguing mechanisms and hold promises for advanced applications in nanoelectronics. However, an explicit analysis of its lattice dynamics and vibrational symmetries, pivotal for understanding the material's peculiar ferroelectric and ferroionic behaviors, remains incomplete. Here, we employ angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy in concert with first-principles calculations to systematically unravel the anisotropic lattice vibrations of CIPS single crystals. By analyzing the polarization-dependent Raman intensities, we determine the symmetry assignments and Raman tensors of all major vibrational modes, revealing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and non-invasive probe for structural and ferroelectric order evolution, by examining temperature-driven phase transitions and thickness-dependent polarization suppression in CIPS. Our findings establish a foundational framework for correlating lattice dynamics with functional properties in CIPS and provide a methodological blueprint for studying other vdW ferroelectrics.

arXiv:2512.20928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconducting nickelates provides a unique opportunity to explore the pairing mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we use ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy to probe the temperature-dependent superfluid density in an infinite-layer samarium nickelate film with a Tc of 20 K. The superfluid density decreases linearly with rising temperature, consistent with clean limit d-wave pairing. From this linear relation, we extract a superconducting gap of 2.5 meV and a gap-to-Tc ratio of 3, suggesting that this sample lies in the weak-coupling limit. Furthermore, the ratio of the mean free path to the coherence length, is determined to be 1.5, confirming the clean-limit behavior. These findings establish strong parallels between the pairing mechanisms in nickelate and cuprate superconductors.

arXiv:2512.20969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ab initio approach is presented for studying the collective excitations in excitonic insulators, charge/spin density waves and superconductors. We derive the Bethe-Salpeter-Equation for the particle-hole excitations in the quasiparticle representation, from which the collective excited states are solved and the corresponding order parameter fluctuations are computed. This method is demonstrated numerically for the excitonic insulating phases of the biased WSe2-MoSe2 bilayer. It reveals the gapless phase-mode, the subgap Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and the above-gap scattering states. Our work paves the way for quantitative predictions of excited state phenomena from first-principles calculations in electronic systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Abstract: We present MOCVD-grown, nitrogen-doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 films as an insulating buffer layer on Fe-doped (010) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates in lieu of 49% HF treatment to remove unintentional silicon at the substrate-epitaxial layer growth interface. N-doped layer thickness and NH3 flow were systematically varied to experimentally determine the lowest nitrogen concentration and thickness of the buffer layer needed to fully compensate the interfacial silicon peak. The NH3 molar flow rate was varied from 200 sccm to 1800 sccm. Results showed fully insulating N-doped layers for samples with NH3 flow rates greater than or equal to 1200 sccm and a thickness of 50 nm. This study demonstrates the efficacy of in-situ, controllably doped nitrogen buffer layers as a mitigation method for unintentional interfacial silicon at the substrate-epitaxial layer growth interface.

Rahil N. Valani

arXiv:2512.21049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friedel oscillations are spatially decaying density modulations near localized defects and are a hallmark of quantum systems. Walking droplets provide a macroscopic platform for hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and Friedel-like oscillations were recently observed in droplet-defect scattering experiments through wave-mediated speed modulation [P.~J.~S\'aenz \textit{et al.}, \textit{Sci.\ Adv.} \textbf{6}, eay9234 (2020)]. Here we show that Friedel-like statistics can also arise from a purely local, dynamical mechanism, which we elucidate using a minimal Lorenz-like model of a walking droplet. In this model, a localized defect perturbs the particle's internal dynamical state, generating underdamped velocity oscillations that give rise to oscillatory ensemble position statistics. This attractor-driven, local mechanism opens new avenues for hydrodynamic quantum analogs based on active particles with internal degrees of freedom.

Ohad Vilk, Baruch Meerson

arXiv:2512.21061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study collective dynamics of an ensemble of $N\gg 1$ independent particles undergoing anomalous diffusion with random renewal resetting. The anomalous diffusion is modeled by the scaled Brownian motion (sBm): a Gaussian process, characterized by a power-law time dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D(t)\sim t^{2H}$, where $H>0$. The particles independently reset to the origin, and each particle's clock is set to zero upon spatial resetting. Employing the known steady-state position distribution of a \emph{single} particle undergoing the sBm with renewal resetting [Bodrova et al., Phys. Rev. E \textbf{100}, 012120 (2019)], we study the collective dynamics of $N$ particles. We determine the statistics of the system radius $\ell$. The typical fluctuations of $\ell$ fall under the Gumbel universality class, and we use extreme value statistics to calculate the moments of $\ell$. We also study the large-deviation statistics of the center of mass (COM), where for $H>1/2$ we uncover an anomalous scaling behavior of the COM distribution, and a singularity in the corresponding rate function, due to a ``big jump" effect.

Abstract: The evolution of cluster structure with size and the critical size for the transition from cluster to nanocrystal have long been fundamental problems in nanoscience. Due to limitations of experimental technology and computational methods, the exploration of the continuous evolution of clusters towards nanocrystal is still a big challenge. Here, we proposed a machine learning force field (MLFF) that can generalize well to various copper systems ranging from small clusters to large clusters and bulk. The continuous evolution of copper clusters CuN towards nanocrystal was revealed by investigating clusters in a wide size range (7 <= N <= 17885) based on MLFF simulated annealing. For small CuN (N < 40), electron counting rule plays a major role in stability. For large CuN (N > 80), geometric magic number rule plays a dominant role and the evolution of clusters is based on the formation of more and more icosahedral shells. For medium size CuN (40 <= N <= 80), both rules contribute. The critical size from cluster to nanocrystal was calculated to be around 8000 atoms (about 6 nm in diameter). Our work terminates the long-term challenge in nanoscience, and lay the methodological foundation for subsequent research on other cluster systems.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive temperature and polarization dependent inelastic light scattering (Raman) study on single crystals of two-dimensional CuCrP2S6, a layered van der Waals material exhibiting coupled magnetic and electric degrees of freedom. Raman measurements were performed from 5 to 300 K to probe phonon dynamics across multiple structural and magnetic phase transitions. Our analysis reveals pronounced thermal hysteresis in phonon self-energy parameters and dynamic Raman susceptibility, confirming the first-order nature of the antipolar transition near TC1 ~ 145 K and a second-order transition near TC2 ~ 190 K. Low-frequency modes associated with Cu+ and Cr3+ ions exhibit softening and anomalous linewidth behaviour, in particular phonon mode P2 (~ 37 cm-1) showing non-monotonic temperature dependence and intensity enhancement near 60 K suggesting persistent off-centre Cu+ dynamics in the quasi-antipolar phase. The coexistence and coupling of soft phonon modes and central peaks indicate a crossover from displacive to order-disorder type transition mechanisms. Additionally, phonon anomalies below the N\'eel temperature (TN ~ 32 K) reflect spin-phonon coupling, linking lattice vibrations to long-range magnetic correlations. Our findings provide critical insight into the lattice instabilities, symmetry evolution, and quasiparticle interactions in CuCrP2S6, offering a deeper understanding of phase transition dynamics in two-dimensional multiferroic systems and guiding future design of magnetoelectric and spintronic devices.

arXiv:2512.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising candidates for next-generation spintronic devices due to their tunable properties and potential for efficient spin-charge interconversion. However, discovering materials with intrinsically high spin Hall conductivity (SHC) is hindered by the vast chemical space and expensive nature of conventional experimental and first-principles methods. In this work, we employ an active learning framework to accelerate the discovery of high-SHC 2D materials. Machine learning (ML) models were trained on SHC values computed from density functional theory calculations, incorporating the Kubo formalism via tight-binding Hamiltonians constructed from maximally localized Wannier functions, with explicit treatment of spin-orbit coupling. Starting from random but chemically diverse 24 2D systems, the dataset was expanded to 41 cases (from an overall pool of around 2000 materials) over three active learning loops using an expected improvement acquisition strategy. The ML technique successfully identified several high SHC candidates with the best candidate exhibiting a SHC of 271.52 (hbar/e) Ohm^-1, nearly 23 times higher than the top performer in the initial round. Beyond candidate discovery, several features such as orbital symmetry near the Fermi energy, types of atomic species, material composition, covalent radii, and electronegativity of constituent atoms were found to play critical role in shaping the spin Hall response in 2D systems. The data generated is made publicly available to facilitate further advances in 2D spintronics.

Yichen Dong, Eugene Demler, Zhiyuan Sun

arXiv:2512.21097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Wigner-crystal states of two-dimensional electrons, the spin ordering remains poorly understood. The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states. These results point to a route for optical detection and control of spin order via its coupling to orbital motion.

arXiv:2512.21100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque efficiency is conventionally fixed by bulk materials. $D$-wave altermagnets introduce an additional nonrelativistic spin-charge conversion channel beyond inverse spin-Hall effect. Using prototypical candidate RuO$_2$ as an example, we show that the adjacent ferromagnet alone can dictate both the magnitude and sign of spin-charge conversion. Spin-pumping measurements on RuO$_2$/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) and RuO$_2$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) bilayers yield opposite effective spin-Hall angles that persist across crystalline and polycrystalline RuO$_2$. Inserting an ultrathin Au spacer at the RuO$_2$/YIG interface reverses the signal, envidencing a dominant interfacial inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect, whereas RuO$_2$/Py is governed by bulk inverse spin-Hall effect. First-principles calculations trace this dichotomy to interface-selective band hybridization: Rashba surface states survive at the insulating YIG contact yet are quenched by metallic Py. Our findings establish ferromagnetic interfacing as a deterministic knob for tailoring spin-charge conversion in altermagnetic oxides, paving the way to field-free, low-dissipation spintronic memory devices.

arXiv:2512.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and topological nature of interface states (IFs) in N-AGNR/$(N-2)$-AGNR/N-AGNR heterostructure (AGNRH) segments lacking translational symmetry, focusing on their relation to the end states (ESs) of the constituent armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) segments. For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,\beta} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $\beta$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\cal T}_{GNR}(\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage.

arXiv:2512.21148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we provide a microscopic lattice construction of excitations, fusion, and shrinking in a non-Abelian topological order by studying the three-dimensional quantum double model. We explicitly construct lattice operators that create, fuse, and shrink particle and loop excitations, systematically derive their fusion and shrinking rules, and demonstrate that non-Abelian shrinking channels can be controllably selected through internal degrees of freedom of loop operators. Most importantly, we show that the lattice shrinking rules obey the fusion--shrinking consistency relations predicted by twisted $BF$ field theory, providing solid evidence for the validity of field-theoretical principles developed over the past years. In particular, we compute the full set of excitations, fusion, and shrinking data at the microscopic lattice level and verify exact agreement between the microscopic $\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the continuum $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ gauge group, thereby placing the latter field theory, originally discovered in 2018 in connection with Borromean-ring braiding, on a solid microscopic footing. Our results bridge continuum topological field theory and exactly solvable lattice models, elevate fusion--shrinking consistency from a continuum field-theoretical principle to a genuine topological phenomenon defined at the microscopic lattice scale, and provide a concrete microscopic foundation for experimentally engineering higher-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in controllable quantum simulators, such as trapped-ion systems.

Abstract: Single-layer transition metal dihalides grown on conducting substrates were shown to host stable polarons. Here, we investigate polarons in insulating single-layer MnBr$_2$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on three different substrates, namely graphene on Ir(110), graphene on Ir(111), and Au(111). The number densities and species of polarons observed vary strongly as a function of the substrate. For MnBr$_2$ grown on Ir(110) the largest number of polaron species is observed, namely four, of which three show clear similarities with the species observed for CoCl$_2$ on graphite. Polarons in single-layer MnBr$_2$ are observed up to 300K. They can be created, converted, and moved by the STM tip when a tunneling current flows at a proper bias voltage. For graphene on Ir(110) as a substrate, mobile polarons in MnBr$_2$ are guided through the periodic potential imposed from the super-moir\'e resulting from the interaction of MnBr$_2$ with graphene and Ir(110). Our findings indicate that modeling of polarons in such single-layer insulators in contact with a conducting substrate requires to take the substrate explicitly into account.

Abstract: The review treats Heusler alloys that display distinctive functional properties, including shape-memory behavior and magnetocaloric effects. Particular emphasis is placed on Heusler systems in which half-metallic ferromagnetism and spin-gapless semiconductor state are realized. Although these compounds are crystallographically rather "ordinary", peculiarities of their electronic structure and magnetic state lead to unconventional kinetic and magnetic properties. Their magnetic and transport characteristics are highly sensitive to external stimuli, and changes in alloy composition or external parameters can induce transitions between the states considered. This tunability provides further opportunities for controlling the electronic and magnetic properties of Heusler alloys and for exploiting them in applications such as spintronics and micro- and nanoelectronics.

Emmanuel Schaub, Martinus H. V. Werts

arXiv:2512.21175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Tau Pulsed Illumination Differential Dynamic Microscopy (MTPI-DDM) is introduced as a method for significantly enhancing the time resolution of DDM. The technique employs simple, low-cost instrumentation comprising a single monochrome digital camera and a single pulsed LED. A timing sequence, based on a geometric progression of time lags, is used to generate a "multi-tau" scheme, providing high sampling density at short timescales where dynamics are fastest. In the current implementation, a temporal resolution of 80 $\mu$s is achieved, limited by the dead time of the camera electronics. Validation of MTPI-DDM was performed by measuring the diffusion of 99 nm polystyrene nanoparticles in water. Compared to conventional continuous-wave (CW) DDM, the pulsed approach extends the range of the shortest measurable time lags by nearly two orders of magnitude and enhances DDM signal amplitudes by eliminating motion blur.

arXiv:2512.21179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological charges (NATCs), characterized by their noncommutative algebra, offer a framework for describing multigap topological phases beyond conventional Abelian invariants. While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials.

Abstract: Quantum geometry, describing the geometric properties of the Bloch wave function in momentum space, has recently been recognized as a fundamental concept in condensed matter physics. The flat-band system offers the paradigmatic platform where quantum geometry plays the essential role in correlated electron phases. However, systems that suffer from significant effects of quantum geometry are not limited to flat-band systems; dispersive-band systems also exhibit quantum condensed phases driven by quantum geometry. In this perspective, we provide a transparent account of quantum geometry and its role in correlated electron phases, throughout flat-band and dispersive-band systems.

Abstract: High-order anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) is observed up to the 18th harmonic in cubic Fe(001) thin films, overturning the long-standing paradigm that only two- and four-fold terms are symmetry-allowed. Using angle-resolved transport and Fourier analysis, we show that six-fold and higher-order terms are intrinsic, tunable by temperature and thickness, and predicted by crystal symmetry. Microscopically, the two-fold sign reversal arises from a crossover between weak and strong scattering regimes, while high-order terms emerge from the interplay of anisotropic Fermi velocity and relaxation time. Our results establish high-order AMR as a symmetry-prescribed property of cubic ferromagnets, providing critical benchmarks for spin-orbit transport theory and enabling new angular-sensitive spintronic functionalities.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at https://github.com/xqh19970407/PhononBench

arXiv:2512.21245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel theoretical expression for the relaxation time of magnetic nanoparticles with dipolar interactions is derived from Kramers' theory, extending the Boltzmann-Gibbs framework to incorporate Tsallis statistics. The model provides, for the first time, a unified description of magnetic relaxation from weakly to strongly interacting regimes, culminating in a spin-glass transition. It accounts for both the decrease and increase of the relaxation time with growing dipolar coupling, a long-standing problem in nanoparticle magnetism, as classical phenomenological models fail to elucidate this transition. This result also offers an innovative interpretation of the cut-off temperature, $T_{cut-off}$, as a spin glass transition under the Tsallis distribution framework within the context of N\'eel-Brown's relaxation theory, thereby contributing to ongoing scientific discussions regarding this phenomenon.

Abstract: Black phosphorus and its single-layer constituent, phosphorene, have emerged as promising two-dimensional materials with remarkable tribological properties. However, recent experimental investigations reveal complex substrate-dependent behavior that affects their lubricating capabilities. This computational study employs density functional theory calculations to quantify the adhesion energy of both pristine and oxidized phosphorene monolayers on various metallic substrates (aluminum, copper, iron, and chromium) and their corresponding oxides ($\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$, $\mathrm{Cu_2O}$, $\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}$, and $\mathrm{Cr_2O_3}$), correlating these fundamental interactions with experimentally observed tribological performance. Results demonstrate that oxidized phosphorene exhibits greater stability than its pristine counterpart and shows higher adhesion to all substrates, attributed to favorable interactions between oxygen non-bonding states and substrate empty states. Adhesion is systematically more favorable on pristine metals than on their corresponding oxides, with chromium and iron showing particularly strong interactions due to partially filled 3d orbitals. This result is consistent with the coefficient of friction decrease observed in tribological experiments after scratching the substrate, thus removing the outermost oxide layer. Charge redistribution and electronic structure analyses reveal system-dependent interfacial bonding characteristics, with some configurations inducing metallic character in phosphorene. These findings provide fundamental insights into substrate-dependent black phosphorus lubricating properties, highlighting the key role of layer-substrate adhesion.

Abstract: We investigate the distribution of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix (entanglement spectrum) after a global quantum quench. We show that in an appropriate scaling limit the lower part of the entanglement spectrum exhibits ``universality''. In the scaling limit and at asymptotically long times the distribution of the entanglement spectrum depends on two parameters that can be determined from the R\'enyi entropies. We show that two typical scenarios occur. In the first one, the distribution of the entanglement spectrum levels is similar to the one describing the ground-state entanglement spectrum in Conformal Field Theories. In the second scenario, the lower levels of the entanglement spectrum are highly degenerate and their distribution is given by a series of Dirac deltas. We benchmark our analytical results in free-fermion chains, such as the transverse field Ising chain and the XX chain, in the rule 54 chain, and in Bethe ansatz solvable spin models.

Abstract: Charge-$4e$ superconductors are phases where quartets of electrons condense in the absence of Cooper pairing condensation. They exhibit distinctive signatures including fractional flux quantization and anomalous Josephson effects, and are actively being explored in strongly correlated systems, such as moir\'e materials. In this work we develop a general framework for \emph{topological} charge-$2ne$ superconductors based on both wavefunction and field theory approaches. In particular, we generate topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors from charge-$2e$ ingredients, and by breaking the charge $U(1)$ symmetry in certain classes of quantum Hall states. Via bulk-edge correspondence, we further construct the corresponding edge conformal field theory and bulk topological quantum field theory for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors that suggests fermionic nonabelian topological orders. Our results provide a unified low energy description of the topological charge-$2ne$ superconductivity, offer a concrete platform for studying symmetry breaking and enrichment in interacting topological phases of matter, and have direct implications for experimental probes such as quasiparticle interferometry.

Abstract: As we move beyond the era of transistor miniaturization, back-end-of-line-compatible transistors that can be stacked monolithically in the third dimension promise improved performance for low-power electronics. In advanced transistor architectures, such as gate-all-around nanosheets, the conventional channel-first process involves depositing dielectrics directly onto the channel. Atomic layer deposition of gate dielectrics on back-end-of-line compatible channel materials, such as amorphous oxide semiconductors, can induce defects or cause structural modifications that degrade electrical performance. While post-deposition annealing can partially repair this damage, it often degrades other device metrics. We report a novel channel-last concept that prevents such damage. Channel-last gate-all-around self-aligned transistors with amorphous oxide-semiconductor channels exhibit high on-state current ($>$ 1 mA/$\mu$m) and low subthreshold swing (minimum of 63 mV/dec) without the need for post-deposition processing. This approach offers a general, scalable pathway for transistors with atomic layer deposited channel materials, enabling the future of low-power three-dimensional electronics.

Abstract: We demonstrate a dual nanopore platform (DNP) containing a top 2D MoS2 pore in series with a 3 to 5 nm thick SiN pore, vertically separated by 30 nm, with diameters of 1.0 and 3.0 nm, respectively. This platform enables independent probing of analytes by each pore, thereby providing complementary information. We measure translocations of single amino acids (AA) and evaluate current blockades recorded across the two pores upon applying voltage. Small diameters ensured tight passage of individual AAs through the nanopores and provided a good signal-tonoise ratio (RMS current noise of 16 pA_RMS and SNR = 6). We focus on measurements of O-Phospho-L-tyrosine at 400 mV, demonstrating single amino acid detection and a good quantitative agreement with the calculated open pore and blocked currents. Based on these results, future device performance can benefit from slightly smaller pores, specifically the SiN pore, higher voltages and electrolyte concentration, and lower system noise.

Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.

Abstract: We describe combined experiments and simulations of droplet breakup during flow-driven interactions with a circular obstacle in a quasi-two-dimensional microfluidic chamber. Due to a lack of in-plane confinement, the droplets can also slip past the obstacle without breaking. Droplets are more likely to break when they have a higher flow velocity, larger size (relative to the obstacle radius R), smaller surface tension, and for head-on collisions with the obstacle. We also observe that droplet-obstacle collisions are more likely to result in breakup when the height of the sample chamber is increased. We define a nondimensional breakup number Bk ~ Ca, where Ca is the Capillary number, that accounts for changes in the likelihood of droplet break up with variations in these parameters. As Bk increases, we find in both experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations of the deformable particle model that the behavior changes from droplets never breaking (Bk << 1) to always breaking for Bk >> 1, with a rapid change in the probability of droplet breakup near Bk = 1. We also find that Bk ~ S^(4/3), where S characterizes the symmetry of the collision, which implies that the minimum symmetry required for breakup is controlled by a characteristic distance h ~ R.

Abstract: Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) generate broadband terahertz (THz) radiation, which is essential for spectroscopy, imaging, and communication. The performances and the essential physical parameters of STE devices are linked to the dielectric properties of the constituent materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is an effective tool to measure these properties, but conventional analysis struggles with thin or complex multilayered systems due to simplifying approximations or complex transfer functions. In this work, we present a practical method to extract dielectric properties of STE multilayers using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). By comparing the THz pulse calculated using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) with the experimentally measured pulse transmitted through the sample, we can extract the dielectric properties of STEs, enhancing THz-TDS analysis and facilitating STE design and optimization. This method avoids constructing complex transfer functions, accommodates diverse sample geometries, and is designed to be accessible, with a publicly available codebase, making it a useful tool for STE research.

Abstract: We study multipartite entanglement in typical pure states holographically dual to pure BTZ black holes, using multi-entropy and its ``genuine'' version. In the bulk, these quantities are computed by minimal geodesic networks (so-called Steiner trees). We find that at sufficiently high temperature, the genuine tripartite multi-entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling in sharp contrast to vacuum AdS$_3$, where the genuine contribution is universal and size-independent. Moreover, we find another phase: once one subsystem exceeds half of the total system, the leading genuine tripartite entanglement vanishes and reduces to that for global AdS${}_3$. This transition is indeed consistent with recent arguments for distillable EPR pairs in tripartite Haar-random states. Motivated by finite-cutoff holography, we further study the radial cutoff dependence of multi-entropy and show that genuine multi-entropy acquires nontrivial size dependence even for the tripartite case in AdS${}_3$. As a byproduct, we also observe an intriguing ``area-law'' contribution to multi-entropy that is relevant to vacuum AdS${}_3$.

Abstract: Controlled and multi-controlled quantum gates, whose action on a target qubit depends on the state of multiple control qubits, represent a fundamental logical building block for complex quantum algorithms. We propose a scheme for realizing this class of gates based on non-Abelian holonomies in modulated photonic waveguide networks. Our approach relies on linear photonic cicuits formed by two star networks coupled via a two-path circuit. A star network with M peripheral waveguides coupled to a single central site, or M-pod, naturally generalizes the tripod structure used in non-Abelian Thouless pumping and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). In the present work, we first analyze the minimal case of two connected tripods and design adiabatic driving loops that implement single-qubit, CNOT, and SWAP gates. We then show how extending the approach to larger M-pod structures enables the realization of multiply controlled operations, which we exemplify by designing Toffoli and the OR gate on two coupled pentapods. Finally, we demonstrate that networks of connected tripods can implement the Deutsch quantum query algorithm.

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductor heterobilayers enable the quantum confinement of interlayer excitons with large out-of-plane permanent electric dipoles and spin-valley control. Here, we report a novel phonon-assisted excitation mechanism of individual moir\'e-trapped interlayer excitons in 2H-stacked MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers via chiral $E^{\prime\prime}$ in-plane optical phonons at the {\Gamma}-point. This excitation pathway preserves valley-selective optical selection rules and enables deterministic generation of individual interlayer excitons with defined helicity, emitting within a spectrally narrow energy spread. Through photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy in both the ensemble and quantum emitter regimes, we identify a fixed phonon energy of $\sim$23 meV mediating the process. First-principles calculations corroborate the symmetry and energy of the relevant phonon mode and its coupling to interlayer excitons, providing microscopic support for the observed valley-selective phonon-assisted excitation mechanism. Our results highlight the utility of chiral phonons as a tool for controlled excitation of quantum emitters in TMD moir\'e systems, opening new opportunities for valleytronic and quantum photonic applications.

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum hardware has emerged as a promising platform for programmable many-body physics. In this work, we develop and validate a practical framework for extracting thermodynamic properties of materials using such hardware. As a test case, we consider nitrogen-doped graphene. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT) formation energies, we map the material energetics onto a Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian suitable for quantum annealing by fitting an on-site term and distance-dependent pair interactions. The Hamiltonian derived from DFT cannot be implemented directly on current QuEra devices, as the largest energy scale accessible on the hardware is two orders of magnitude smaller than the target two-body interaction in the material. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a rescaling strategy based on a single parameter, $\alpha_v$, which ensures that the Boltzmann weights sampled by the hardware correspond exactly to those of the material at an effective temperature $T' = \alpha_vT$, where $T$ is the device sampling temperature. This rescaling also establishes a direct correspondence between the global laser detuning $\Delta_g$ and the grand-canonical chemical potential $\Delta\mu$. We validate the method on a 28-site graphene nanoflake using exhaustive enumeration, and on a larger 78-site system where Monte Carlo sampling confirms preferential sampling of low-energy configurations.

Abstract: In micro- and nanoscale optomechanical systems, radiation pressure interactions are often complemented or impeded by photothermal forces arising from thermal strain induced by optical heating. We show that the sign and magnitude of the photothermal force can be engineered through deterministic nanoscale structural design, by considering the overlap of temperature and modal strain profiles. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a specific system: a nanobeam zipper cavity by changing the geometry of its supporting tethers. A single design parameter, corresponding to a nanoscale geometry change, controls the magnitude of the photothermal backaction and even its sign. These insights will allow engineering the combined photothermal and radiation pressure forces in nano-optomechanical systems, such that backaction-induced linewidth variations are deterministically minimized if needed, or maximized for applications that require cooling or amplification at specific laser detuning.

Abstract: We construct a series of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits and integrate them into 3D cavities. For a single-qubit device, we demonstrate flux-tunable qubit transition, with a measured $T_1$ $\approx$ 48 ns and a lower bound estimate of $T_2^\ast$ $\approx$ 17.63 ns. By coupling the device to cavities with different resonant frequencies, we access multiple qubit-cavity coupling regimes, enabling the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting and flux-dependent spectral linewidths. In a two-qubit device consisting of a SQUID and a single junction, power-dependent measurements reveal a two-stage dispersive shift. By flux-tuning the cavity frequency at different readout powers, we attribute the first shift to the fixed-qubit and the second to the SQUID-qubit, indicating successful coupling between the two circuits and a single cavity mode. Our study demonstrates the flexible coupling achievable between 2D-material-based superconducting circuits and 3D cavities, and paves the way toward constructing multi-qubit 3D transmon devices from 2D materials.

Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We study two spinless bosons interacting via two-body Gaussian potential subjected to an externally impressed rotation about an axis confined in a harmonic trap in two-spatial dimensions. We obtain a transcendental equation for the relative angular momentum $|m|$ state with various values of the two-body interaction range $\sigma$ and the two-body interaction strength $g_{2}$ to study the resulting energy spectrum and analyze the role of Hilbert space dimensions $\widetilde{N}$. We compare results for both attractive and repulsive interaction for $\delta$-function potential and Gaussian potential for various values of interaction range. We study the effects of interaction parameters and relative angular momentum on the ground state energy and its various components, namely, kinetic energy, trap potential and interaction potential. For a given $|m|$ and non-interacting case, we observe that the ground state energy becomes independent of interaction range. However, for a given relative angular momentum and interaction strength $g_{2}>0$, there is an increase in ground state energy with an increase in interaction range. Below the interaction strength $g_{2}V(r)\leq -1$, ground state energy diverges to physically unacceptable negative-infinity for $|m|=0$ state. Further, for $|m|=1$, the ground state energy becomes independent of the interaction strength. For a $|m|$, we present a comparative study between the Gaussian interaction potential and the $\delta$-function potential. Further, we observe that for a given $g_{2}$ and $|m|$, for $\delta$-function potential {\it i.e.} $\sigma\to 0$, to achieve the convergence of ground state energy, we require a considerably large critical Hilbert space. Whereas, in the case of Gaussian interaction potential with $\sigma\to 1$, the ground state energy converges for a considerably small critical Hilbert space.

Abstract: We study electron transport in molecular nanojunctions that are driven by incoherent radiation using Markovian quantum dynamics based on the Lindblad quantum master equation. General expressions for the transient electron and photon currents between system and reservoir are derived. For experimentally relevant nanojunction configurations that include on-site Coulomb repulsion, electron tunneling, spontaneous photon emission, and incoherent driving, we show that Lindblad theory can reproduce stationary conductance features reported in the literature such as negative differential conductance, Coulomb blockade, and current-induced light emission. Light-induced currents are predicted for two-site configurations with ground-level tunneling when the incoherent driving rate is comparable with the transfer rate to contact electrodes. Model extensions to include coherent light-matter interaction are suggested.

Abstract: Active fluids display spontaneous turbulent-like flows known as active turbulence. Recent work revealed that these flows have universal features, independent of the material properties and of the presence of topological defects. However, the differences between defect-laden and defect-free active turbulence remain largely unexplored. Here, by means of large-scale numerical simulations, we show that defect-free active nematic turbulence can undergo dynamical arrest. This state is characterized by an emergent network of nematic domain walls that channels coherent streams and suppresses chaotic flows. As the system evolves, the branched wall network produces a large-scale pattern with tree-like topological properties. We find that flow alignment -- the tendency of nematics to reorient under shear -- enhances large-scale chaotic jets in contractile rodlike systems while promoting dynamical arrest in extensile systems. We further show that dynamical arrest persists regardless of whether defects are prohibited by construction or simply fail to form due to a high energy cost of defect cores. Taken together, our findings reveal a striking pattern-formation mechanism, with labyrinths emerging from active turbulence, and illuminate the rich transitional regime between defect-free and defect-laden dynamics. These behaviors call for the experimental realization of active nematics at vanishing or low defect densities, and underscore that, in extensile rodlike nematics, topological defects enable turbulence by preventing dynamical arrest.

Abstract: Doping a Mott insulator is widely expected to produce mobile Cooper pairs whose kinetic energy sets the superfluid stiffness. Here we demonstrate a striking counterexample. We show that when doped charges propagate on the line-graph of a lattice with strong pairing interaction, they bind into obstructed Cooper pairs whose motion is frustrated by destructive interference. As a result, the leading-order pair kinetic energy vanishes identically in the strong-coupling expansion, producing a flat bosonic band of compact localised pair states and a vanishing superfluid stiffness at leading order. The low-energy Hilbert space is dominated by these localised pairs, yielding an extensively degenerate ground-state manifold and a superfluid stiffness that vanishes anomalously as the third inverse power of the pairing strength. At quarter filling, the frustrated pair dynamics maps onto a quantum dimer model at the Rokhsar-Kivelson point, realizing a d-wave resonating-valence-bond spin liquid with topological ground-state degeneracy and deconfined holon excitations. Our results establish a disorder-free mechanism for interaction-driven localization, in which strong pairing collapses the kinetic energy of Cooper pairs.

Abstract: We present a novel aligning active matter model by extending the nematic alignment rule in self-propelled rods to tunable alignment angles, as represented by collision of cone-shaped particles. Non-vanishing alignment angles introduce frustration in the many-body interactions, and we investigate its effect on the collective behavior of the system. Through numerical simulations of an agent-based microscopic model, we found that the system exhibits distinct phenomenology compared to the original self-propelled rods. In particular, anti-parallel bands are observed in an intermediate parameter range. The linear stability analysis of the continuum description derived from the Boltzmann approach demonstrates qualitative consistency with the microscopic model, while frustration due to many-body interactions in the latter destabilizes homogeneous nematic order over a wide range of the alignment angle.

Abstract: Interactions between active particles may be non-reciprocal, breaking action-reaction symmetry and leading to novel physics not observed in equilibrium systems. The non-reciprocalCahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model is a phenomenological model that captures the large-scale effects of non-reciprocity in conserved, phase-separating systems. In this work, we explore the consequences of different variations of this model corresponding to different symmetries, inspired by the importance of symmetry in equilibrium universality classes. In particular, we contrast two models, one with a continuous SO(2) symmetry and one with a discrete C_4 symmetry. We analyze the corresponding models by constructing three-dimensional linear stability diagrams. With this, we connect the models with their equilibrium limits, highlight the role of mean composition, and classify qualitatively different instabilities. We further demonstrate how non-reciprocity gives rise to out-of-equilibrium steady states with non-zero currents and present representative closed-form solutions that help us understand characteristic features of the models in different parts of the parameter space.

Abstract: The doping dependence of the superfluid density $\rho_{\text{s}}$ exhibits distinct behaviors in the underdoping and overdoping regimes of the cuprate, while the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_c$ generally scales with $\rho_{\text{s}}$. In this paper, we present a unified understanding of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and $\rho_{\text{s}}$ across the entire doping range by incorporating the underlying mutual Chern-Simons gauge structure that couples the spin and charge degrees of freedom in the doped Mott insulator. Within this framework, the SC phase fluctuations are deeply intertwined with the spin dynamics, such that thermally excited neutral spins determine $T_c$, while quantum spin excitations effectively reduce the superfluid density at zero temperature. As a result, a Uemura-like scaling of $T_c$ vs. $\rho_{\text{s}}$ in the underdoped regime naturally emerges, while the suppression of both $T_c$ and $\rho_{\text{s}}$ at overdoping is attributed to a drastic reduction of antiferromagnetic spin correlations.

Abstract: We report the experimental observation of discrete bright matter-wave solitons with attractive interaction in an optical lattice. Using an accordion lattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the interaction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site and multisite solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. The experimental results qualitatively agree with a Gaussian variational model and match quantitatively with numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation extended with a quintic term to account for the loss of atoms. Our results provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms, paving the way for further studies of transport and dynamical properties of matter-wave solitons in lattices.

Abstract: We consider a rhombohedral-stacked $N$-layer graphene coupled to a monolayer of Haldane model. We show that high order Dirac points in multilayer graphene can be gapped out by topological proximity effect of the Haldane model layer, leading to total Chern number $|C|=N+1$ quantum anomalous Hall states. This provides a new way to construct high Chern number quantum anomalous Hall states in realistic crystalline graphene systems.

Abstract: High-strength steel is a structural metal crucial for load-bearing components yet is known to be highly susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Vanadium (V) and niobium (Nb) containing precipitated carbides introduce strong hydrogen traps to immobilize hydrogen, thus mitigating HE. However, variations in intrinsic vacancy concentrations in these carbides affect hydrogen thermodynamics and kinetics but remain poorly understood. Employing first-principles calculations, hydrogen trapping and diffusion in V/Nb carbides were investigated. Hydrogen dissolution energies are composition-dependent, revealing a transition from reversible to irreversible trapping with increasing carbon vacancy content, prescribed by the strength of covalent bonds with neighboring V/Nb atoms. Meanwhile, the diffusion energy barrier decreases with increasing carbon vacancy content, attributed to changes in vacancy patterns within carbides. The findings contribute new and critical knowledge for understanding hydrogen trapping and diffusion in sub-stoichiometric V/Nb carbides, providing valuable guidance for process and composition innovation of high-strength alloy steels for better HE resistance.

Abstract: Long-wavelength collective shear dynamics are profoundly different in solids and liquids. According to the theoretical framework developed by Maxwell and Frenkel, collective shear waves vanish upon melting by acquiring a characteristic wave-vector gap, known as the $k$-gap. While this prediction has been supported by numerous simulations, experimental validation remains limited. Moreover, this phenomenon has been never tested across a continuous glass transition between a liquid phase and a glassy state with large but finite viscosity. In this work, we track the dispersion relation of collective shear modes in a two-dimensional colloidal system and provide direct experimental evidence for the emergence of a $k$-gap. This gap opens continuously at an effective temperature consistent with the onset of the glass transition and the vanishing of the static shear modulus. By extracting the instantaneous shear velocity from the experimental data, we uncover a shear relaxation time exhibiting a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence characteristic of glass-forming materials, accurately described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) relation. Our results confirm the predictions of the Maxwell-Frenkel framework and highlight their relevance across continuous melting processes originating from low-temperature amorphous solid phases.

Abstract: The kagome lattice provides a playground to explore novel correlated quantum states due to the presence of flat bands in its electronic structure. Recently discovered layered kagome compound Nb3Cl8 has been proposed as a Mott insulator coming from the half-filled flat band. Here we have carried out systematic transport study to uncover the evidence of Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8 thin flakes. Bipolar semiconducting property with Fermi level close to conduction band has been revealed. We have further probed the chemical potential of Nb3Cl8 by tracing the charge neutrality point of the monolayer graphene proximate to Nb3Cl8. The gap of Nb3Cl8 flakes is approximately 1.10 eV at 100 K and shows pronounced temperature dependence, decreasing substantially with increasing temperature to ~0.63 eV at 300 K. The melting behavior of the gapped state is in consistent with theoretically proposed Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8. Our work has demonstrated Nb3Cl8 as a promising platform to study strongly correlated physics at relatively high temperature.

Abstract: We introduce GEARS H, a state-of-the-art machine-learning Hamiltonian framework for large-scale electronic structure simulations. Using GEARS H, we present a statistical analysis of the hole concentration induced in defective $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ interfaced with Ni-doped amorphous $\mathrm{HfO}_2$ as a function of the Ni doping rate, system density, and Se vacancy rate in 72 systems ranging from 3326 to 4160 atoms-a quantity and scale of interface electronic structure calculation beyond the reach of conventional density functional theory codes and other machine-learning-based methods. We further demonstrate the versatility of our architecture by training models for a molecular system, 2D materials with and without defects, solid solution crystals, and bulk amorphous systems with covalent and ionic bonds. The mean absolute error of the inferred Hamiltonian matrix elements from the validation set is below 2.4 meV for all of these models. GEARS H outperforms other proposed machine-learning Hamiltonian frameworks, and our results indicate that machine-learning Hamiltonian methods, starting with GEARS H, are now production-ready techniques for DFT-accuracy device-scale simulation.

Abstract: The celebrated {\it fluctuation dissipation theorem} (FDT) does not apply to nonequilibrium systems. In this context, Cugliandolo and Kurchan [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 71}, 173 (1993)] introduced a generalized FDT which interprets the nonequilibrium evolution as a composition of {\it time sectors} corresponding to different {\it effective temperatures}. We use this framework to study domain growth in the $d=2$ long-range Ising model (LRIM) with nonconserved kinetics ({\it Glauber spin-flip}) and conserved kinetics ({\it Kawasaki spin-exchange}). We study the dynamical scaling and super-universal (SU) scaling of various two-time quantities, e.g., autocorrelation function, response function, effective temperature, etc. In particular, we investigate how the interaction range and conservation laws affect these characteristic features of domain growth.

Abstract: Characterization of the structure and properties of materials in three dimensions, including grains and the residual pattern of deformation, provides necessary information required to guide materials design as well as support materials modelling efforts. In this work, we present an overview of site-specific large volume 'chunk' lift out and 3D serial sectioning of substantive volumes (e.g. 200 x 200 x 400 um3), where sectioning is optimized for 3D electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) based crystallographic analysis, using a plasma (Xe) focussed ion beam scanning electron microscope (plasma FIB-SEM) equipped to perform EBSD using a 'static' configuration (i.e. slicing and EBSD-mapping are performed without moving the sample). This workflow is demonstrated through the 3D plasma FIB-SEM based EBSD analysis of an indent made within a polycrystal of pure magnesium. The lift out approach is suitable for a wide range of materials, and we offer a step-by-step guide within the present work to provide opportunity for others to more easily enter this field and collect valuable data.

Abstract: An accurate understanding of the ground state electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a high-temperature superconductor under pressure, is key for unveiling the origin of its superconductivity. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.

Abstract: Frictional instabilities in fluid saturated granular materials underlie natural hazards, including submarine landslides and earthquake initiation. Experiments show distinct failure behaviors under subaerial and subaqueous conditions due to coupled deformation, interparticle friction, and particle fluid interactions. We use three-dimensional coupled computational fluid dynamics, discrete element method (CFD - DEM) to investigate collapse and runout of dense and loose granular assemblies in both environments. Parametric analyses show that pore pressure evolution controls failure mode in saturated settings (fast vs slow sliding), consistent with prior laboratory experiments and lattice Boltzmann discrete element simulations: dense assemblies stabilize via dilation, whereas loose assemblies compact rapidly and transiently fluidize. At mesoscale, we coarse grain particle contact statistics and Eulerian fluid fields to define apparent friction and normalized pore pressure, and organize inertial and viscous responses using log10(In/Iv). Spatiotemporal analyses of these coarse grained fields reveal strain rate dependent behavior governed by evolving porosity and effective stress. In both environments, friction in failure shear zone is rate-strengthening with respect to inertial number (In, for dry) and viscous number (Iv, for fluid-saturated). We further utilize mesoscale stress framework to compare evolution of pore pressure in CFD - DEM of subaqueous slope collapse with an analytical solution for development of failure front, using inputs derived from numerical triaxial DEM tests on same assemblies. The analytical model reproduces steady-state excess pore pressures and captures fluid-particle coupling, but mismatch near failure onset suggests transient frictional effects. These results support physics-based hazard models and improve mechanistic understanding of saturated granular failure.

Abstract: We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30~K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.

Abstract: Thermomechanical processing alters the microstructure of metallic alloys through coupled plastic deformation and thermal exposure, with dislocation motion driving plasticity and microstructural evolution. Our previous work (Islam et al., 2025) showed that the same dislocation motion both creates and destroys chemical short-range order (SRO), driving alloys into far-from-equilibrium SRO states. However, the connection between this dislocation-mediated SRO evolution and processing parameters remains largely unexplored. Here, we perform large-scale atomistic simulations of thermomechanical processing of equiatomic TiTaVW to determine how temperature and strain rate control SRO via competing creation ($\Gamma$) and annihilation ($\lambda$) rates. The simulations employ systems containing 2.4 million atoms and utilize a machine learning interatomic potential optimized to capture chemical complexity through the motif-based sampling technique. Using information-theoretic metrics, we quantify that the magnitude and chemical character of SRO vary systematically with processing parameters. We identify two regimes: a low-temperature regime with weak strain-rate sensitivity, and a high-temperature regime in which reduced dislocation density and increased screw character amplify chemical bias and accelerate SRO formation. The resulting steady-state SRO is far-from-equilibrium and cannot be produced by equilibrium thermal annealing. Together, these results provide a mechanistic and predictive link between processing parameters, dislocation physics, and SRO evolution in chemically complex alloys.

Abstract: Chiral two-dimensional electron gases, which capture the electronic properties of graphene and rhombohedral graphene systems, exhibit singular momentum-space vortices and are susceptible to interaction-induced topological Haldane phases. Here, we investigate pairing interactions in these inversion-symmetric Haldane phases of chiral two-dimensional electron gases. We demonstrate that the nontrivial band topology of the Haldane phases enhances intra-valley (${\bf Q} = \pm 2 {\bf K_D}$) pair susceptibility relative to inter-valley (${\bf Q} = 0$) pair susceptibility, favoring the emergence of a lattice-scale pair-density wave order. When longitudinal acoustic phonons mediate the pairing interaction, the system supports a chiral Kekul\`{e} superconducting order. Our findings are relevant to superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene and Kagome metals.

Abstract: Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.

Abstract: We theoretically predict a spin-current analog of the quantized circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. This phenomenon is forbidden in antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions. Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle calculations. Our work unveils a distinctive optical response of altermagnets, paving the way for a new frontier in altermagnetism.

Abstract: Trilayer graphene allows systematic control of its electronic structure through stacking sequence and twist geometry, providing a versatile platform for correlated states. Here we report magnetotransport in alternating twisted trilayer graphene with a twist angle of about 5$^{\circ}$. The data reveal an electron-hole asymmetry that can be captured by introducing layer-dependent potential shifts. At charge neutrality ($\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$), three low-resistance states appear, which Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis attributes to emerging spin-resolved helical edge modes similar to those of quantum spin Hall insulators. At $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=-1$, we also observe suppressed resistance when the middle and bottom layers are each half filled while the top layer remains inert at $\nu=-2$, consistent with an interlayer excitonic quantum Hall state. These results demonstrate correlated interlayer quantum Hall phases in alternating twisted trilayer graphene, including spin-resolved edge transport and excitonic order.

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a highly tunable class of crystalline materials where metal atoms or clusters are connected by organic linkers. They offer a versatile platform for exploring quantum phenomena such as entangled magnetism, superconductivity, and topology.

However, despite their promise, their low-temperature behavior and magnetic properties remain largely unexplored and represent an underappreciated opportunity in quantum materials research. With potential applications ranging from quantum computation to energy transfer, we believe that MOFs and particularly magnetic MOFs offer a vast and largely untapped frontier for transformative discoveries and high-impact quantum materials research.

Abstract: We formulate gauge invariance for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical multi-component systems. Species-resolved phase space shifting constitutes a gauge transformation which we analyze using Noether's theorem and shifting differential operators that encapsulate the gauge invariance. The approach yields exact equilibrium sum rules for general mixtures. Species-resolved gauge correlation functions for the force-force and force-gradient pair correlation structure emerge on the two-body level. Exact 3g-sum rules relate these correlation functions to the spatial Hessian of the partial pair distribution functions. General observables are associated with hyperforce densities that measure the covariance of the given observable with the interparticle, external, and diffusive partial force density observables. Exact hyperforce and Lie algebra sum rules interrelate these correlation functions with each other. The practical accessibility of the framework is demonstrated for binary Lennard-Jones mixtures using both adaptive Brownian dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, we investigate the force-force pair correlation structure of the Kob-Andersen bulk liquid and we show results for representative hyperforce correlation functions in Wilding et al.'s symmetrical mixture confined between two asymmetric planar parallel walls.

The four gapped phases display ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic magnetic orders along the (1, 1, 0)- and (1, -1, 0)-spin directions, whereas in the gapless phases, the low energy spectrum consists of two branches of helical Majorana fermions with unequal velocities. Transition lines separating different phases include deconfined quantum critical lines with dynamical critical exponent z = 1 and quadratic critical lines with z = 2.

Abstract: We demonstrate that in an ideal Weyl semimetal, in which the Fermi energy coincides with the band-touching nodes, weak direct inter-nodal scattering is irrelevant and, as a result, the chiral charge is (almost) exactly conserved. This leads to an experimentally-observable effect: in an applied magnetic field, the charge transport along the field becomes purely ballistic, with the conductance given by $e^2/h$ per magnetic flux quantum through the sample cross-section. This is the strongest experimental manifestation of nontrivial topology in Weyl and Dirac semimetals.

Abstract: Altermagnets have garnered great interest due to their non-relativistic spin splitting and novel physical properties. However, the control of altermagnetic states remains underexplored. Here, we propose a unique multiferroic state, i.e. ferroelastic altermagnetic state, in which ferroelastic strain couples directly to the spin-splitting. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify the ferroelastic $d$-wave altermagnetism of puckered pentagonal CoSe$_2$ monolayer. Interestingly, uniaxial stress can induce a ferroelastic phase transition, accompanied by a $90\degree$ rotation of the spin-splitting bands. Cooperative rotation of the lattice and N\'eel vectors preserves the sign of Kerr angle, whereas noncooperative rotation reverses it. Our work provides a general strategy for manipulating altermagnetism in multiferroic systems and opens other avenues for exploring emergent magnetoelastic phenomena.

Abstract: Understanding how granular materials respond to shear stress remains a central challenge in soft matter physics. We report direct observations of persistent granular convection in the bulk shear zones of spherical particle packings -- a phenomenon previously associated primarily with particle shape anisotropy or boundary effects. By employing various bead-coloring techniques in a split-bottom geometry, we reveal internal flow fields within sheared granular packings. We find robust convection rolls, strikingly governed by system geometry: at low filling heights, two counter-rotating convection rolls emerge, while at higher filling heights, a single dominant convection roll forms, featuring radially outward flow at the surface. This transition is driven by the height-dependent broadening of the shear zone, which introduces shear rate asymmetry across its flanks. Notably, the transition occurs entirely within the open shear band regime. These findings underscore the pivotal role of system geometry in shaping secondary flow formation in dense packings of frictional particles, suggesting possible broader relevance to geophysical flow dynamics and industrial applications.

Abstract: Lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) is a nonlinear optical material of high interest for integrated photonics with applications ranging from optical communications to quantum information processing. The performance of on-chip devices based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is presently limited by fabrication imperfections such as sidewall surface roughness and geometry inhomogeneities over the chip. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could potentially be used to overcome these difficulties. Although an isotropic ALE process for LN has been reported, performing LN fabrication completely with ALE faces several challenges, including the lack of a directional ALE process for pattern transfer and the redeposition of involatile compounds. Here, we report a directional ALE process for LN consisting of sequential exposures of HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma for surface modification and Ar plasma for removal. The HBr chemistry is found to decrease redeposition compared to F- and Cl-based plasmas, which we attribute to the higher vapor pressures of Br-based products. A grating pattern etched entirely by the process (total etch depth of 220 nm) exhibits no aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) down to the smallest tested gap of 150 nm, in contrast to ion milling in which ARDE manifests even at 300 nm gaps for the same etch depth. The HBr plasma chemistry is also found to support an isotropic process consisting of sequential exposures of H$_2$ plasma and HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma. These processes could be used together to perform the complete fabrication process for TFLN devices, eliminating imperfections arising from ion milling.

Abstract: The magnons in altermagnets exhibit chiral splitting even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and external magnetic fields. Typically, this chiral splitting behavior can be well described by alternating isotropic spin exchanges (ISE) near the zero temperature. However, its finite-temperature dynamics, particularly when incorporating spin-orbit coupling effects, remains elusive. In this study, we reveal that, when including magnon-magnon interactions, long-range anisotropic spin exchange (ASE) can also induce chiral splitting of magnons at a finite temperature. Crucially, the chiral splitting induced by ASE competes with that arising from ISE, leading to a pronounced temperature-dependent modulation of the altermagnetic chiral splitting. Moreover, this competition is intimately connected to spin fluctuations, and can reverse the spin current driven by the band splitting as temperature increases. Our work uncovers the intrinsic competition governing collective spin excitations in altermagnets, providing new insights into their finite-temperature dynamical behavior.

Abstract: We study the diffusion of a charged particle in a magnetic field subject to stochastic dichotomous fluctuations. The associated induced electric field gives rise to non-trivial dynamical regimes. In particular, when the mean magnetic field vanishes, the particle remains confined within a finite radius, regardless of the fluctuation statistics. For a non-zero mean field, we shows, using a density approach for Poissonian fluctuations, that the particle undergoes an exponential regime of accelerated diffusion. Crucially and more generally, adopting a trajectory-based formalism, we derive an exact analytical solution valid for arbitrary waiting-time distributions, including non-Poissonian and non-ergodic cases. Even rare, abrupt field reversal are shown to trigger exponential acceleration of the particle's diffusion. We demonstrate that this behaviour stems from noise exciting resonance bands present for periodic fluctuations, and we propose noise-induced resonant acceleration as a robust and efficient charge acceleration mechanism, potentially more effective than Fermi's classic model for cosmic acceleration.

Abstract: Thanks to improved methods for numerical analytic continuation with constraints, spectral functions with sharp features can now be extracted from imaginary-time correlation functions computed by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Here we test these new approaches on various one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin systems with a single ejected fermion, i.e., extracting the single-hole spectral function $A(k,\omega)$. We compute the Green's function $G(r,\tau)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,\omega)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=\pi$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation. Our results overall demonstrate the power of modern analytic continuation tools in combination with large-scale QMC simulations.

Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a unified hydrodynamic and Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the screened Stokes equations of the membrane-subphase composite, we derive the real-space incompressible Green's tensor, obtain its near- and far-field asymptotics, and construct the resulting dipolar velocity and stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations.

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices with long-range periodicity exhibit Hofstadter energy spectra under accessible magnetic fields, enabling the exploration of emergent quantum phenomena through a hierarchy of fractal states. However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moir\'e superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moir\'e-engineered 2D systems.

Abstract: In this work we develop constitutive equations for a dense, sheared suspension of frictionally interacting rods by applying Onsager's variational method as formulated by Doi. We treat both solid friction, of the Amontons-Coulomb form; and lubricated friction, which scales with relative tangential velocity at the contact point. Dissipation functions in terms of the rod angular velocity are derived via a mean field approach for each form of friction, and from these, a Rayleighian for dense suspensions of rigid rods under shear constructed. Derivatives of this Rayleighian with respect to rod angular velocity and velocity gradient give a Smoluchowski equation and stress tensor, respectively. We show that these are representable as perturbations to Doi's model for a sheared liquid crystal. We also suggest a form for the average number of contacts between rods as a function of volume fraction, aspect ratio, and nematic order parameter, generalizing Philipse's random contact equation for disordered packings.

Abstract: Spin glasses occupy a unique place in condensed matter: they freeze collectively while remaining struc-turally disordered, and they exhibit slow, history-dependent dynamics that reflect an exceptionally rug-ged free-energy landscape. This review provides an integrated account of spin-glass physics, emphasiz-ing how microscopic ingredients (quenched randomness, frustration, competing exchange interactions, and random fields) conspire to produce macroscopic glassiness. We begin with the canonical Edwards-Anderson and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick formulations to introduce the central theoretical ideas that recur across the literature: extensive degeneracy, metastability, and the emergence of long relaxation times that manifest as aging, memory, and rejuvenation under standard experimental protocols. We then summarize the principal routes used to characterize spin-glass freezing, combining thermodynamic signatures with dynamical probes that reveal the separation of timescales and the sensitivity to thermal and magnetic histories. Building on these foundations, we draw connections across experimental material classes (me-tallic alloys, insulating oxides, and geometrically frustrated systems) by emphasizing how intrinsic ver-sus induced disorder and competing interaction networks shape the observed phenomenology. Recent advances in reentrant and room-temperature spin-glass materials are highlighted as a rapidly developing direction that tests the limits of established paradigms and motivates new materials-driven questions. The review concludes by connecting modern computational developments, including machine-learning phase identification and neural-network analogies, to longstanding challenges in classification, univer-sality, and out-of-equilibrium behavior, and by outlining emerging opportunities at the boundary between classical and quantum spin glasses.

Abstract: Magnetic and electronic transport properties of Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ga, Ge, Si, Sn) Heusler alloys were experimentally investigated. Electrical resistivity, in the temperature range from 4.2 to 300 K, as well as field dependences of the Hall effect and magnetization at T = 4.2 K in magnetic fields up to 100 kOe and 70 kOe, respectively, were measured. Experimental data are in good agreement with the results of the theoretical DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic moments. In the band structure of Co$_2$MnSi, half-metallicity is formed with the full spin polarization and the half-metallic gap of about 0.6 eV. In Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ge, Sn), it is shifted from the Fermi energy by the hole pockets at the point $\Gamma$, preventing thereby the formation of the half-metallic state. In a peculiar case of Co$_2$MnGa, the antisite defects are expected to determine structural and electronic properties. For the Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa topological semimetals, Weyl topological points are found at the Fermi energy; however, for Z = Si, Ge, Si, these features are located deeper within to the valence band. The results show that Co$_2$MnGe and Co$_2$MnSn are usual ferromagnets, Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa alloys are topological semimetals that can find application in microelectronics, while Co$_2$MnSi is a half-metallic ferromagnet that is in high demand in spintronics.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using an annealing-based approach involves solving generalized eigenvalue problems. Discretizing a PDE yields a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be formulated as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be transformed into an optimization problem with an objective function given by a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm requires iterative computations. However, it enables efficient annealing-based computation of eigenvectors to arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables. Investigations using simulated annealing demonstrate how the number of iterations scales with system size and annealing time. Computational performance depends on system size, annealing time, and problem characteristics.

Abstract: In Abelian gauge theories with dynamical matter, Wilson lines can end on the insertions of charged fields. We study the endpoints of Wilson lines in large $N$ bosonic QED$_3$. at its critical point. We first study the stability of an infinite Wilson line in the $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model by computing the appropriate functional determinant at large $N$. We also compute the conformal dimension of the lowest-dimension endpoint of the line to first order in $N^{-1}$. Along the way we calculate the field-strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ in the presence of the line with endpoint and discuss a state-operator correspondence for the endpoints, as well as the existence of an OPE that allows two open-ended Wilson lines to be glued together into a single line.

Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science. We discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. These resources can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega(\log (t/\epsilon))$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, entanglement, magic, and coherence do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states by transforming $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit, $O(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon))$, is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. As a concrete example, we propose classical shadow tomography using an estimator with superpositions between only two states, from which almost all quantum states can be efficiently certified by requiring only $O(1)$ measurements and classical post-processing time.

Abstract: The depletion of energy sources, worsening environmental issues, and the quantum limitations of integrated circuits for information storage in the post-Moore era, are pressing global concerns. Fortunately, two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials, possessing broken spatial symmetry, with emerging pressure-dependent and non-linear optical response, piezoelectricity, valley polarization, Rashba spin splitting and more, have established a substantial platform for exploring and applying modifiable physical, chemical and biological properties in material science and offered a promising solution for these energy and information issues. To furnish researchers with a comprehensive repository of 2D Janus family, this review systematically summarizes their theoretical predictions, experimental preparations, and modulation strategies. It also retrospectively outlines the recent advances in modifiable properties, applications, and inherent mechanisms in optics, catalysis, piezoelectricity, electrochemistry, thermoelectricity, magnetism, and electronics, with a focus on experimentally realized hexagonal and trigonal Janus structures. Additionally, their current research state is summarized, and potential opportunities and challenges that may arise are highlighted. Overall, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for designing, fabricating, regulating, and applying 2D Janus systems, both theoretically and experimentally. This review will strongly promote the advanced academic investigations and industrial applications of 2D Janus materials in energy and information fields.

arXiv:2509.05250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-dimensional Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. In the critical regime, for $1/2 \leq s \leq 1$, this system realizes a family of nontrivial one-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), whose data vary continuously with $s$. For $s>1$ the model has instead no phase transition at finite temperature, as in the short-range case. In the standard field-theoretic description, involving a generalized free field with quartic interactions, the critical model is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled in the vicinity of the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We introduce a dual formulation that becomes weakly coupled as $s \to 1$. Precisely at $s=1$, the dual description becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition of the two-dimensional free scalar. We present a detailed study of the dual model and demonstrate its effectiveness by computing perturbatively the CFT data near $s=1$, up to next-to-next-to-leading order in $1-s$, by two independent approaches: (i) standard renormalization of our dual field-theoretic description and (ii) the analytic conformal bootstrap. The two methods yield complete agreement.

arXiv:2509.09402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a coupled two-qubits heat engine fueled by generalized measurements of the spin components and using a single heat reservoir as sink. Our model extends the proposal of Yi and coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] where the role of a hot reservoir in a four-stroke cycle was replaced by a quantum measurement apparatus, the other steps being two quantum adiabatic strokes and thermalization with a cold reservoir. We propose a five-stroke cycle, where an ergotropy extracting stroke is introduced following the measurement stroke, and study the effect of measurements of different spin components on the performance of the machine. For measurements along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine ( {without the adiabatic strokes}) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine. For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we illustrate, for specific cases (e.g. x-x), a definite ordering may be obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as three-stroke counterparts.

arXiv:2509.15204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phases at zero temperature can be characterized as equivalence classes under local unitary transformations: two ground states within a gapped phase can be transformed into each other via a local unitary circuit. We generalize this circuit-based characterization of phases to systems at finite-temperature thermal equilibrium described by Gibbs states. We construct a channel circuit that approximately transforms one Gibbs state into another provided the two are connected by a path in parameter space along which a certain correlation-decay condition holds. For finite-dimensional systems of linear size $L$ and approximation error $\epsilon$, the locality of the circuit is ${\rm polylog}({\rm poly}(L)/\epsilon)$. The correlation-decay condition, which we specify, is expected to be satisfied in the interior of many noncritical thermal phases, including those displaying discrete symmetry breaking and topological order. As an application, we show that any system in the same thermal phase as a zero-temperature topological code coherently preserves quantum information for a macroscopically long time, establishing self-correction as a universal property of thermal phases. As part of the proof, we provide explicit encoding and decoding channel circuits to encode information into, and decode it from, a system in thermal equilibrium.

arXiv:2511.01909v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the Marcus theory of electron transfer defines the reorganization energy as a classical quantity, recent work has shown for the first time that the reorganization energy is actually a quantum mechanical object that depends on the electronic coupling. We extend this picture and show that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.

Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.
