Magnons with momentum-dependent chirality are a key signature of altermagnets. We identify bicircular light as a smoking-gun optical probe for chiral altermagnetic magnons, selectively targeting their quantum geometry induced by an alteration of magnonic chirality. We show that in $d$-wave altermagnets, under a canting magnetic field, the altermagnetic magnons realize a nontrivial quantum geometry, resulting in an enhancement of the nonlinear second-order light-magnon interactions. We find that the scattering of bicircular pulses probes the present magnon quantum geometry, even if the magnonic topology is trivial. Hence, our findings establish bicircular Raman response as an optical effect of choice to identify altermagnetic magnons. As such, we propose a universal experimental protocol to distinguish altermagnets from antiferromagnets by detecting their magnon chirality patterns with light, independently of the underlying magnon topology.

Bibhut Sahoo, Rituparno Mandal, Peter Sollich
We study a non-reciprocal version of Model B, as the continuum theory for non-reciprocal particle mixtures. In contrast to non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard models, it is important in this context to consider the dependence of mobility coefficients on the local concentrations. We show that a homogeneous state that is linearly stable for one form of the mobility can be unstable for a different form of mobility, an effect that would be impossible in equilibrium and implies a crucial role for mobilities in non-reciprocal mixtures. For unstable homogeneous states we study the spinodal dynamics governing the onset of phase separation. We find, again in contrast to non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard models, that exceptional point transitions between static and oscillatory instabilities are generically avoided by first order transitions where the spinodal lengthscale changes discontinuously. At these transitions we find intricate spinodal dynamics with two competing lengthscales, one governing a static instability and the other an oscillatory instability, i.e. one that generates travelling waves. We demonstrate that, depending on interaction strengths, more complex transitions can occur in the spinodal dynamics, including coexistence of three lengthscales and first order transition lines, terminated by critical points, between distinct static instabilities. Finally, we explore the effects of additional non-reciprocity in the interfacial chemical potentials, which would generically be expected when obtaining Model B by coarse graining from a non-reciprocal particle model. We show that interfacial non-reciprocity can increase the region in the spinodal phase diagram where oscillatory instabilities occur, but only up to a certain boundary that we establish analytically and demonstrate numerically.

GJ Sreejith, Sandipan Manna
We investigate signatures of quantum chaos and complexity in the quantum annealing Ising model on random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. By tuning the connectivity of the graph, the dynamics can be driven from a localized phase through a chaotic regime to an integrable limit. While this dynamical transition reflects in the spectral characteristics, we pursue a broader suite of quantum chaos indicators,some of which can be measured on near-term quantum devices. We study deep thermalization of a quantum state ensemble obtained from a natural unraveling of the subsystem density matrix as an indicator of chaotic dynamics. This extends the analysis of quantum chaos to the ensemble of quantum states. Furthermore, we analyze the eigenstate and eigenvalue correlations through the partial spectral form factor of subsystems and observe distinct signatures of the onset of chaos and its system size dependence, providing experimentally measurable indicators of the localization-to-chaos transition. As a locality-independent probe, we show that the Krylov complexity of operators is also maximized in the chaotic regime, providing a link between graph topology and information scrambling. Finally, we investigate a quantum analogue of the Mpemba effect, where initially "hotter" states can thermalize anomalously fast, a phenomenon most cleanly observed within the chaotic phase. However, away from the chaotic regime, the system is distinguished by multiple crossings across connectivity in its distance from the thermal ensemble with time. Collectively, this work presents a broad characterization of chaos, providing insight beyond spectral analysis and practical indicators for benchmarking near-term quantum devices.

The equilibrium magnetic states of single-domain magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) result from a subtle interplay between size, geometry, and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. In this work, we present a micromagnetic study of shape-controlled magnetite NPs using the superball geometry, which provides a continuous interpolation between spheres and cubes. By isolating the influence of shape, we analyze the transition from quasi-uniform (single-domain) to vortex-like states as particle size increases, revealing critical sizes that depend on the superball exponent. Our simulations show that faceted geometries promote the stabilization of vortex states at larger sizes, with marked distortions in the vortex core structure. The inclusion of cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, representative of magnetite, further lowers the critical size and introduces preferential alignment along the [111] easy axes. In contrast, the presence of slight particle elongation increases the critical size and induces another preferential alignment direction. These results demonstrate that even small deviations from sphericity or aspect ratio significantly alter the magnetic ordering and stability of equilibrium magnetic states.

Szu-Cheng Cheng, Yu-Wen Wang, Wen-Hsuan Kuan
We investigate the nonlinear Bloch dynamics and Landau-Zener tunneling of quantum droplets in optical lattices, where the interplay between mean-field repulsion and beyond-mean-field attraction from Lee-Huang-Yang corrections introduces a localization impedance that inhibits dynamical dispersion. This self-stabilizing mechanism is crucial to droplet mobility and nonlinear dephasing under external driving. In the deep-lattice regime, simulation in tight-binding reduction reveals breathing modes, self-trapping, and nonlinear Bloch oscillations. In the shallow-lattice regime, we reformulate the problem in momentum space and map the dynamics onto a nonlinear two-level model with time-dependent detuning. The adiabatic spectrum features looped bands and multiple fixed points, parallelly captured by the phase-space structure through a classical Josephson analogy. Applying Hamilton-Jacobi theory, we quantify the tunneling probabilities and demonstrate nonreciprocal Landau-Zener tunneling. The transition probability from the lower to upper band differs from that of the reverse process, even under the same sweeping protocol. This asymmetry arises from nonlinearly induced band gap modulation, highlighting rich dynamical behavior beyond the linear and adiabatic regimes.

Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results, and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives. SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps, including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization, embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing materials knowledge.

[7]. [*On the Pure States of the Replica Symmetry Breaking ansatz*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02990 "On the Pure States of the Replica Symmetry Breaking ansatz")
Simone Franchini
We discuss the concept of Pure State of the Replica Symmetry Breaking ansatz in finite and infinite spin systems without averaging on the disorder, nor using replicas. Consider a system of n spins $\sigma\in\Omega^{n}$ with the usual set $\Omega=\left\{ -1,1\right\}$ of inner states and let $G:\,\Omega^{n}\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]$ a Gibbs measure on it of Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ (also non random). We interpret the pure states of a model $\left(\Omega^{n},\mu\right)$ as disjoint subsets $\Omega^{n}$ such that the conditional measures behaves like product measures as in usual mean field approximations. Starting from such definition we try to reinterpret the RSB scheme and define an approximated probability measure. We then apply our results to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model to obtain the Parisi formula.

[8]. [*Structure Fluctuation Effects on Canonical-Nonlinear Thermodynamics*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03005 "Structure Fluctuation Effects on Canonical-Nonlinear Thermodynamics")
Koretaka Yuge
When we consider classical discrete systems under constant composition, their stable configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium can be typically obtained through the well-known canonica average phi. In configurational thermodynamics, phi as a map from many-body interatomic interaction to equilibrium configuration generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity, strongly depending on their underlying lattice. The connection between nonlinearity in phi (canonical nonlinearity) and the lattice has recently been amply investigated in terms of configurational geometry, leading to establishing its stochastic-thermodynamic treatment. The present work provides natural extention of the proposed treatment, explicitly including the effect of spatial fluctuation of the equilibrium configuration on thermodynamic property of the nonlinearity. We find that the fluctuation affects the upper-bound for the averaged nonlinearity disparity in multiple configurations, as an explicit and additional contribution from stochastic mutual information between focused coordination and its fluctuation, and an implicit contribution from changes in covariance matrix for density of states due to the fluctuation.

The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is emerging as a powerful tool for imaging magnetic and electric signals at the microscale and below. However, most imaging demonstrations thus far have relied on costly, millimeter-sized bulk diamond substrates, which cannot be easily scaled or integrated with other materials. Here, we report a scalable method for fabricating NV-containing dense and homogenous fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) layers through electrostatic self-assembly and demonstrate the utility of the FND layers for magnetic imaging. We investigate the effect of FND concentration in suspension, substrate immersion time, and solvent pH on the FND density on the substrate. We identify optimized self-assembly conditions that maximize the FND density while minimizing aggregation. Using FND layers on a quartz substrate, we demonstrate magnetic field and magnetic noise imaging at the microscale, based on NV optically detected magnetic resonance magnetometry and T$_1$ relaxometry, respectively. Our results provide a direction for the development of cost-effective and scalable FND layers and surface coatings. This paves the way for on-demand quantum sensing and imaging on a broad range of surfaces based on NV centers and other diamond quantum emitters.

Quantum materials with bands of narrow bandwidth near the Fermi level represent a promising platform for exploring a diverse range of fascinating physical phenomena, as the high density of states within the small energy window often enables the emergence of many-body physics. On one hand, flat bands can arise from strong Coulomb interactions that localize atomic orbitals. On the other hand, quantum destructive interference can quench the electronic kinetic energy. Although both have a narrow bandwidth, the two types of flat bands should exhibit very distinct spectral properties arising from their distinctive origins. So far, the two types of flat bands have only been realized in very different material settings and chemical environments, preventing a direct comparison. Here, we report the observation of the two types of flat bands within the same material system--an above-room-temperature van der Waals ferromagnet, Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$, distinguishable by a switchable iron site order. The contrasting nature of the flat bands is also identified by the remarkably distinctive temperature-evolution of the spectral features, indicating that one arises from electron correlations in the Fe(1) site-disordered phase, while the other geometrical frustration in the Fe(1) site-ordered phase. Our results therefore provide a direct juxtaposition of the distinct formation mechanism of flat bands in quantum materials, and an avenue for understanding the distinctive roles flat bands play in the presence of magnetism, topology, and lattice geometrical frustration, utilizing sublattice ordering as a key control parameter.

Bulk-boundary correspondence is the foundational principle of topological physics, first established in the quantum Hall effect, where a $D$-dimensional topologically nontrivial bulk gives rise to $(D-1)$-dimensional boundary states. The advent of higher-order topology has generalized this principle to a hierarchical chain, enabling topological states to appear at $(D-2)$ or even lower-dimensional boundaries. To date, all known realizations of topological systems must require a topologically nontrivial bulk to initiate the chain of action for bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, in an acoustic crystal platform, we experimentally demonstrate an exception to this paradigm--embedded topology in a trivial bulk--where the bulk-boundary correspondence originates from a trivial bulk. Rather than relying on global symmetries, we employ projective crystal symmetry, which induces nontrivial topology not at the outset in the $D$-dimensional bulk, but midway through the correspondence hierarchy in lower-dimensional boundaries. We further realize a three-dimensional system exhibiting embedded topology that supports zero-dimensional topological states, achieving the longest possible chain of action for such an unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence in physical space. Our work experimentally establishes a new form of bulk-boundary correspondence initiated from a trivial bulk, opening additional degrees of freedom for the design of robust topological devices.

Vo Van Tai, Truong Van Tuan, Tran Trong Tai, Le Tri Dat, Nguyen Duy Vy
We theoretically study the thermoelectric transport S in a double-layer bilayer graphene (BLG-GaAs-BLG) system on dielectric substrates (h-BN, Al2O3, HfO2). Electrons interact with GaAs acoustic phonons via both the deformation potential (acDP) and piezoelectric (acPE) scattering. Results show that piezoelectric scattering dominates the total transport, especially at low carrier density and high dielectric constant. Substrate dielectric constant significantly influences thermopower S, and the thermopower of the materials is in the order of HfO2 > Al2O3 > h-BN. When densities on two BLG layers are unequal, the contribution from acDP scattering Sd decreases (increases) at low (high) densities versus equal densities, while acPE scattering Sg remains stable, making S largely Sg-dependent. Increasing interlayer distance d enhances S, while higher temperature boosts Sd (notably at low densities) with minimal effect on Sg. These insights and substrate-dependent trends demonstrate substrate engineering as a key parameter for optimizing BLG thermoelectric devices

Solid-state systems with flat electronic bands have a theoretical propensity to form electronic orders such as superconductivity and charge-density waves. However, for many flat-band systems such as Kagome and Clover lattices, the flat bands do not naturally appear at the Fermi level, hence not driving the low-energy electronic ordering. Here we demonstrate the concurrent formation of flat bands at the Fermi level and a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}\, R30^\circ$ charge order in a van der Waals magnet Fe5GeTe2 using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. This charge order is manifested by clear band structure folding below 100 K, yet the band folding is limited to 30 meV below the Fermi level where the flat bands reside. The nesting vector in the reciprocal space connects segments of Fermi surfaces where pronounced flat bands are discovered. Taken together with calculations of the Lindhard response function, our results establish Fe5GeTe2 as a model system where flat bands promote inter-band nesting and electronic ordering. The appearance of the flat band at the Fermi level is reminiscent of the Kondo lattice effect, yet we point out that the flat bands may originate from the abundance of vacancies in the Fe(1) sublattice, where the vacancies induce flat dispersions via destructive charge or spin interactions.

The exploration of topological Dirac surface states is significant in the realms of condensed matter physics and future technological innovations. Among the materials garnering attention is Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, a compound that theoretically exhibits topological insulating properties. However, its inherent p-type nature prevents the direct experimental verification of its Dirac surface state due to the Fermi level alignment with the valence band. In this study, by doping Cr atoms into Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, n-type behavior is observed in the Hall resistance measurements. Remarkably, the Cr-doped Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ not only shows ferromagnetism with a high transition temperature of approximately 170 K but also exhibits an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). The Cr doping also allows for a controlled method for Fermi level tuning into the band gap. These properties spotlight its potential as an n-type magnetic topological insulator (MTI) as well as a material candidate for the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), opening new avenues for applications in spintronics and quantum devices.

Identifying useful sorbent materials for direct air capture (DAC) from humid air remains a challenge. We present the Open DAC 2025 (ODAC25) dataset, a significant expansion and improvement upon ODAC23 (Sriram et al., ACS Central Science, 10 (2024) 923), comprising nearly 70 million DFT single-point calculations for CO$_2$, H$_2$O, N$_2$, and O$_2$ adsorption in 15,000 MOFs. ODAC25 introduces chemical and configurational diversity through functionalized MOFs, high-energy GCMC-derived placements, and synthetically generated frameworks. ODAC25 also significantly improves upon the accuracy of DFT calculations and the treatment of flexible MOFs in ODAC23. Along with the dataset, we release new state-of-the-art machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ODAC25 and evaluate them on adsorption energy and Henry's law coefficient predictions.

Qianxi Zhu, Wang Gao, Qing Jiang
The solution and diffusion of interstitial non-metallic solutes (INSs) like H, He, O, C, N, P, and S is common in refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) and essentially controls the RHEAs properties. However, the disorder local chemical environments of RHEAs hinder the quantitative prediction of the stability and diffusivity of INSs and the understanding of the underlying mechanism. Based on the tight-binding models, we propose an analytic model for determining the stability and diffusivity of INSs in RHEAs, by approximating the bonding length between INSs and their neighbors with the atomic radius of the neighbors in elemental states. This predictive model identifies that the energetics of INSs depends linearly on the d-band width of their neighbors, with the slope determined by the valence of INSs. Our scheme provides an electronic-level understanding of INSs in RHEAs and explains key experimental observations, which can serve as an effective tool for designing advanced RHEAs.

Shuo Wang, Jing-Run Lin, Zheng-Wei Zuo
In the research of the topological band phases, the conventional wisdom is to start from the crystalline translational symmetry systems. Nevertheless, the translational symmetry is not always a necessary condition for the energy bands. Here we propose a systematic method of constructing the topological band insulators without translational symmetry in the amorphous systems. By way of the isospectral reduction approach from spectral graph theory, we reduce the structural-disordered systems formed by different multi-atomic cells into the isospectral effective periodic systems with the energy-dependent hoppings and potentials. We identify the topological band insulating phases with extended bulk states and topological in-gap edge states by the topological invariants of the reduced systems, density of states, and the commutation of the transfer matrix. In addition, when the building blocks of the two multi-atomic cells have different number of the lattice sites, our numerical calculations demonstrate that the existences of the flat band and the macroscopic bound states in the continuum in the amorphous systems. Our findings uncover a new arena for the exploration of the topological band states beyond translational symmetry systems paradigm.

Thermoelectricity usually originates from energy-dependent transport asymmetries. In this Letter, we explore a purely quantum thermoelectric effect rooted in the emission/absorption asymmetry of a low-temperature quantum bath. We propose a gap-asymmetric S-I-S' superconducting tunnel junction in thermal equilibrium, coupled to a low-temperature electromagnetic environment, which develops a nonlinear quantum bipolar thermoelectric effect due to the dynamical Coulomb blockade. Key performance features are analyzed for realistic implementations.

Ricardo Ortiz, Karol Struty\'nski, Manuel Melle-Franco
Altermagnetism stands as a third type of collinear magnetic order, whose band structure combines a net zero magnetization with a non-relativistic spin-splitting caused by a broken time reversal symmetry. So far, the strategy to design platforms displaying altermagnetism has relied mostly on inorganic crystals with d-metals as spin centers, where a representative example is the two-dimensional square lattice with antiparallel D2h magnetic blocks related by a pi/2 rotation. Despite the fact that there is no strong requirement for the magnetic atoms to be metals, the construction of an altermagnetic framework with light elements like carbon is challenging due to symmetric constrictions. We show how it is possible to overcome this by including non-alternant rings in pi-conjugated nanographenes. More specifically, dibenzo[ef,kl]heptalene, an S = 1 pi-conjugated hydrocarbon consisting of a graph of two fused heptagons and hexagons, represents a suitable building block for an altermagnetic 2D crystal. In this work, we confirm this hypothesis with DFT calculations of the spin polarized band structure, presenting a spin compensated ground state with broken time reversal symmetry, and a d-wave symmetry of the first valence and conduction bands. Consistent results are obtained for covalent organic frameworks based on dibenzo[ef,kl]heptalene units connected by linkers, paving the way for the realization of organic altermagnetic materials.

Jiaming Hu, Zhichao Guo, Wenbin Li, Hua Wang, Kai Chang
Light-induced coherent phonons provide a powerful platform for ultrafast control of material properties. However, the microscopic theory and quantum geometric nature of this phenomenon remain underexplored. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical framework based on Feynman diagrams to systematically describe the generation of coherent phonons by light. We identify a dominant second-order, double-resonant process in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors that efficiently couples light to both electronic and phononic excitations. Crucially, we uncover the quantum geometric origin, encoded in the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) shift vector and the EPC quantum geometric tensor. Applying our theory to ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and SnSe, we demonstrate the potential for light-induced modulation of ferroelectric polarization driven by coherent phonons. This work provides fundamental insights for designing efficient optical control strategies for both coherent phonons and ferroelectric polarization.

High throughput experimentation tools, machine learning (ML) methods, and open material databases are radically changing the way new materials are discovered. From the experimentally driven approach in the past, we are moving quickly towards the artificial intelligence (AI) driven approach, realizing the 'inverse design' capabilities that allow the discovery of new materials given the desired properties. This review aims to discuss different principles of AI-driven generative models that are applicable for materials discovery, including different materials representations available for this purpose. We will also highlight specific applications of generative models in designing new catalysts, semiconductors, polymers, or crystals while addressing challenges such as data scarcity, computational cost, interpretability, synthesizability, and dataset biases. Emerging approaches to overcome limitations and integrate AI with experimental workflows will be discussed, including multimodal models, physics informed architectures, and closed-loop discovery systems. This review aims to provide insights for researchers aiming to harness AI's transformative potential in accelerating materials discovery for sustainability, healthcare, and energy innovation.

Weijie Wu, Zehua Li, Yu Wang
We present an extended two-dimensional XY rotor model specifically designed to capture the polarization dynamics of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite monolayers. This framework integrates nearest and next-nearest neighbor couplings, crystalline anisotropy inherent to perovskite lattice symmetries, external bias fields, and long-range dipolar interactions that are prominent in layered perovskite architectures. Through a combination of analytical coarse-graining and large-scale Monte Carlo simulations on 64*64 lattices, we identify two distinct thermodynamic regimes: a low-temperature quasi-ferroelectric state characterized by finite polarization and domain wall formation, and a higher-temperature Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) crossover associated with vortex-antivortex unbinding and the suppression of long-range order. Our results reproduce key experimental signatures observed in quasi-two-dimensional perovskites, including dual peaks in dielectric susceptibility, enhanced vortex density near the transition, multistable polarization hysteresis under applied fields, and the scaling behavior of domain wall widths. This minimal yet realistic model provides a unifying perspective on how topological transitions and ferroelectric ordering coexist in layered perovskite systems, offering quantitative guidance for interpreting the emergent polar vortex lattices and complex phase behavior recently reported in hybrid perovskite thin films.

Henry Davenport, Frank Schindler, Johannes Knolle
We investigate low energy excitons in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN/R5G/hBN), focusing on the regime at the experimental twist angle $\theta = 0.77^\circ$ and with an applied electric field. We introduce a new low-energy two-band model of rhombohedral graphene that captures the band structure more accurately than previous models while keeping the number of parameters low. Using this model, we show that the centres of the exciton Wannier functions are displaced from the moir\'e unit cell origin by a quantised amount -- they are instead localised at $C_3$-symmetric points on the boundary. We also find that the exciton shift is electrically tunable: by varying the electric field strength, the exciton Wannier centre can be exchanged between inequivalent corners of the moir\'e unit cell. Our results suggest the possibility of detecting excitonic corner or edge modes, as well as novel excitonic crystal defect responses in hBN/R5G/hBN. Lastly, we find that the excitons in hBN/R5G/hBN inherit excitonic Berry curvature from the underlying electronic bands, enriching their semiclassical transport properties. Our results position rhombohedral graphene as a compelling tunable platform for probing exciton topology in moir\'e materials.

Tantalum nitride (TaN) has attracted considerable attention due to its unique electronic and thermal properties, high thermal conductivity, and applications in electronic components. However, for the {\theta}-phase of TaN, significant discrepancies exist between previous experimental measurements and theoretical predictions. In this study, deep potential models for TaN in both the {\theta}-phase and amorphous phase were developed and employed in molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the thermal conductivities of bulk and nanofilms. The simulation results were compared with reported experimental and theoretical results, and the mechanism for differences were discussed. This study provides insights into the thermal transport mechanisms of TaN, offering guidance for its application in advanced electronic and thermal management devices.

The untapped potential of thermal metamaterials requires the simultaneous observation of both diffusive and wave-like heat propagation across multiple length scales that can only be realised through theories beyond Fourier. Here, we demonstrate that tailored material patterning significantly modifies heat transport dynamics with enhanced non-Fourier behaviour. By bridging phonon scattering mechanisms with macroscopic heat flux via a novel perturbation-theory approach, we derive the hyperbolic Cattaneo model directly from particle dynamics, establishing a direct link between relaxation time and phonon lifetimes. Our micro-scale patterned systems exhibit extended non-Fourier characteristics, where internal interfaces mediate wave-like energy propagation, diverging sharply from diffusive Fourier predictions. These results provide a unified framework connecting micro-scale interactions to macroscopic transport, resolving long-standing limitations of the Cattaneo model. This work underscores the transformative potential of thermal metamaterials for ultra-fast thermal management and nanoscale energy applications, laying a theoretical foundation for next-generation thermal technologies.

Small-scale plasticity and creep behavior of a Zr-based BMG were investigated using nanoindentation. Four load functions, differing only in hold times of 0, 10, 30, and 60 seconds at peak load, were applied. Results indicate spatially heterogeneous and time-sensitive plastic behavior. Machine learning clustering, based on hardness and creep displacement, suggested three clusters. Statistical analysis of plastic energy distributions enabled identification of potential deformation mechanisms within the clusters.

Driven non-equilibrium lattice models have wide-ranging applications in contexts such as mass transport, traffic flow, and transport in biological systems. In this work, we investigate the steady-state properties of a one-dimensional lattice system that allows multiple particle occupancy on each site. The particles undergo stochastic nearest-neighbor jumps influenced by both a directional bias and on-site repulsive interactions. With periodic boundary conditions, we observe a non-monotonic dependence of inter-site correlation functions on the interaction strength. At large interaction strengths, the particle current exhibits a periodic dependence on density, accompanied by the formation of ordered stacks of particles. In contrast, with open boundary conditions, the system displays step-like density profiles reminiscent of those in tilted Bose-Hubbard systems, and a regime with a macroscopic number of empty sites followed by a steep parameter-dependent increase in density. Our results highlight how the interplay between drive, interaction, and boundary conditions leads to distinctive signatures on the current and density profiles in the steady state in different regimes.} {We also study the problem on a random comb, a simple model of a disordered system.

In electrical metrology, the quantum Hall effect is accessed at the Landau level filling factor {\nu} = 2 plateau to define and disseminate the unit of electrical resistance (ohm). The robustness of the plateau is only exhibited at this Landau level filling factor and thus places a constraint on the quantized resistances that are accessible when constructing quantized Hall array resistance standards (QHARS) using epitaxial graphene on SiC. To overcome devices constrained by using Hall elements in series or in parallel, this work approaches the fabrication of a cross-square network configuration, which is similar to but departs slightly from conventional wye-delta designs and achieves significantly higher effective quantized resistance outputs. Furthermore, the use of pseudofractal-like recursion amplifies the ability to reach high resistances. QHARS devices designed as the ones here are shown to achieve an effective resistance of 55.81 M$\Omega$ in one configuration and 27.61 G$\Omega$ in another, with a hypothetically projected 317.95 T$\Omega$ that could be accessed with more specialized equipment. Teraohmmeter measurements reveal the limits of conventional wet cryogenic systems due to resistance leakage. Ultimately, this work builds on the capability of realizing exceptionally high-value quantum resistance standards.

Self-burrowing robots navigating through granular media benefit from airflow-assisted burrowing, which reduces penetration resistance. However, the mechanisms underlying airflow-granular interactions remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employ a coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) approach, supplemented by experimental cone penetration tests (CPT) under varying airflow conditions, to investigate the effects of aeration on penetration resistance. Experimental results reveal a nonlinear relationship between penetration resistance reduction and depth, wherein resistance approaches near-zero values up to a critical depth, beyond which the effectiveness of fluidization diminishes. Simulations demonstrate that higher airflow rates enhance the mobilization of overlying grains, increasing the critical depth. A detailed meso- and micro-scale analysis of particle motion, contact forces, and fluid pressure fields reveals four distinct penetration stages: particle ejection and channel formation, channel sealing, channel refill, and final compaction. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of granular aeration mechanisms and their implications for geotechnical engineering, excavation technologies, and the development of self-burrowing robotic systems.

We investigate the realization and control of subgap states by tailored altermagnetic fields on unconventional superconductors. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Furthermore, we find that the altermagnetism-induced subgap states give rise to a large spin conductance at zero net magnetization which helps identify the strength of the underlying altermagnetism and superconductivity. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting spintronic devices.

We report on the impact of manganese doping at the iron sites in Gadolinium Iron Garnet (GdIG, Gd$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$), employing temperature-dependent spin Seebeck effect and ferromagnetic resonance measurements. Our findings reveal a clear shift in the magnetic compensation temperature ($T_{comp}$) in Mn-doped GdIG, with minimal changes observed in the magnetic and damping properties. Notably, the spin Seebeck signal strength was enhanced significantly with the Mn doping. This enhancement is attributed to an increased spin mixing conductance and modifications in the magnon spectra that strengthen exchange interactions, highlighting the material's potential for room-temperature spintronic applications.

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable accurate atomistic modelling, but reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains elusive. In this study, we investigate two UQ strategies, ensemble learning and D-optimality, within the atomic cluster expansion framework. It is revealed that higher model accuracy strengthens the correlation between predicted uncertainties and actual errors and improves novelty detection, with D-optimality yielding more conservative estimates. Both methods deliver well calibrated uncertainties on homogeneous training sets, yet they underpredict errors and exhibit reduced novelty sensitivity on heterogeneous datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce clustering-enhanced local D-optimality, which partitions configuration space into clusters during training and applies D-optimality within each cluster. This approach substantially improves the detection of novel atomic environments in heterogeneous datasets. Our findings clarify the roles of model fidelity and data heterogeneity in UQ performance and provide a practical route to robust active learning and adaptive sampling strategies for MLIP development.

High-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has attracted significant interest in condensed matter physics. While early samples exhibited limited superconducting volume fractions, Pr substitution for La enabled bulk superconductivity in polycrystals under pressure and enhanced transition temperatures in thin films at ambient pressure. Beyond rare-earth doping, moderate oxygen or ozone annealing improves superconductivity by mitigating oxygen vacancies, whereas high-pressure oxygen annealing leads to a trivial, non-superconducting metallic state across all pressure regimes. These findings highlight the need to elucidate both the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry in modulating superconductivity in bilayer nickelates. Here, using multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ and high-pressure-oxygen-annealed La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$ polycrystals. We find that Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites, effectively eliminating inner-apical oxygen vacancies and ensuring near-stoichiometry in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ that is bulk-superconducting under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers into p-d hybridized orbitals, ultimately suppressing superconductivity. This behavior starkly contrasts with cuprate superconductors, where similar interstitial oxygen ordering enhances superconductivity instead. Our findings reveal a competition between striped interstitial oxygen order and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, offering key insights into their distinct pairing mechanisms and providing a roadmap for designing more robust superconducting phases.

FeSe has been one of the most intensively studied iron-based superconductors over the past two decades, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, nematic order, magnetism, orbital-selective correlations, and structural phase transitions. While topologically non-trivial phases have been identified in certain cases - such as Te-doped FeSe and monolayer FeSe - topology in bulk FeSe has largely remained unexplored. In this work, we propose a new route to realize topological phases directly in bulk FeSe. We demonstrate that breaking the in-plane $C_4$ rotational symmetry, thereby lowering the crystal symmetry, can drive FeSe into a strong topological insulating phase. To support this, we perform density functional theory calculations and analyze the band structure using topological quantum chemistry and symmetry-based indicators. Our results show that both uniaxial strain and the structural transition to the orthorhombic low-temperature phase lead to non-trivial band topology. Moreover, incorporating electronic correlations through dynamical mean field theory reveals that the topological characteristics near the Fermi level remain robust, as the relevant bands experience only moderate renormalization. These findings highlight strain as a promising mechanism to induce topological phases in FeSe.

Metastable silicon phases have attracted extensive attention these years, due to their fundamentally distinct photoelectric properties compared to the conventional diamond cubic (I) counterpart. Certain metastable phases, prepared via thermal heating method, can exhibit direct bandgap characteristics, significantly enhancing their light absorbance and quantum efficiency. Herein, we tentatively demonstrate an all-silicon photodetector working from near- to mid-infrared bands through precisely selective laser annealing strategy. We systematically investigated the optical properties and optoelectronic response of III/XII mixture, IV phase, and III/XII-I homojunctions. The obtained results reveal that III/XII composite and IV phase exhibit negative and positive photoconductivity, respectively. Furthermore, the established laser heating approach facilitates us to fabricate all-silicon homostructures with tunable photoconductive properties, such as III/XII-I and IV-I junctions. These findings can expand the potential applications of metastable semiconducting materials in optoelectronics and photodetectors.

Polymorphs are distinct structural forms of the same compound and offer unique opportunities to tailor material properties without altering chemical composition. In particular, the polymorphs of WO$_3$ have been widely explored for their molecular sensing performance; yet, the mechanistic aspects behind their different chemoresistive properties have remained elusive or poorly understood. Here, we highlight the energetic allocation of transferred charge as a critical aspect for chemoresistive response generation, providing a new perspective beyond more conventional net-transfer metrics, which are usually deployed to investigate gas-solid interactions. To this, we combined operando work function, chemisorption analysis, and in situ spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations on the example of acetone. Both gamma- and $\varepsilon$-WO$_3$ exhibit comparable surface-level activation of acetone, mediated by electron-deficient, coordinatively unsaturated tungsten sites. However, only $\varepsilon$-WO$_3$ stabilizes analyte-induced electronic states derived from W(5d) orbitals lying just below the conduction band - an energetically favourable region for conductivity modulation under operating conditions. While being associated with marginal work function shifts, these states reflect deeper subsurface electronic rearrangements that may underlie the $\varepsilon$-WO$_3$'s superior transduction efficiency despite similar receptor chemistry. Our results offer a new framework for rational transducer development rooted in intrinsic electronic structure.

Aside from recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models, specialized AI hardware is crucial to address large volumes of unstructured and dynamic data. Hardware-based AI, built on conventional complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS)-technology, faces several critical challenges including scaling limitation of devices [1, 2], separation of computation and memory units [3] and most importantly, overall system energy efficiency [4]. While numerous materials with emergent functionalities have been proposed to overcome these limitations, scalability, reproducibility, and compatibility remain critical obstacles [5, 6]. Here, we demonstrate oxide-interface based polymorphic electronic devices with programmable transistor, memristor, and memcapacitor functionalities by manipulating the quasi-two-dimensional electron gas in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures [7, 8] using lateral gates. A circuit utilizing two polymorphic functionalities of transistor and memcapacitor exhibits nonlinearity and short-term memory, enabling implementation in physical reservoir computing. An integrated circuit incorporating transistor and memristor functionalities is utilized for the transition from short- to long-term synaptic plasticity and for logic operations, along with in-situ logic output storage. The same circuit with advanced reconfigurable synaptic logic operations presents high-level multi-input decision-making tasks, such as patient-monitoring in healthcare applications. Our findings pave the way for oxide-based monolithic integrated circuits in a scalable, silicon compatible, energy efficient single platform, advancing both the polymorphic and neuromorphic computings.

Leonardo Lucchesi, Federico Paolucci
Thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions has always been studied under the hypothesis of equilibrium between the cold side and the thermal bath, usually in the linear regime. We define a more complete out-of-equilibrium nonlinear numerical model that reduces to the equilibrium linear model in the low-power limit. We find that the linear model does not correctly describe the behavior of superconducting tunnel junctions for parameters that are reasonable in practical experimental setups. Subsequently, we present the qualitative and quantitative differences between the models, discovering that for high power, the junction saturates and then inverts its behavior. Finally, we also clarify the difference between linear and nonlinear thermoelectricity and devise a new criterion to find nonlinear thermoelectricity in the parameter space.

Using molecular simulations and classical density functional theory, we study the liquid-crystalline phase behaviour of a series of bent rod-like mesogens with a controlled degree of chirality introduced through a twist at the centre of the particle. In the achiral limit, isotropic, uniaxial nematic, twist-bend nematic and smectic phases form as the packing fraction increases. On introducing chirality, the symmetry between the right- and left-handed twist-bend phases is broken. The phase with the same-handedness as the particles quickly becomes overwhelmingly favoured as the magnitude of the particle twist is increased, because the particles are then able to better follow the helical director field lines in the twist-bend phase and pack more efficiently. By contrast, the cholesteric phase is predicted to have the opposite handedness to that of the particle due to the relatively weakly-twisted nature of the particles. That the cholesteric and twist-bend phases have opposite handedness illustrates the differences in the mechanisms of chirality transfer in the two phases. We also found that doping a system of achiral mesogens with a small fraction of chiral particles led to selection of the twist-bend phase with the same chirality as the particle.

Conventional topological classification theory dictates that time-reversal symmetry confines the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, permitting only a single pair of gapless helical edge states. Here, we utilize the recently discovered altermagnetism to circumvent this fundamental constraint. We demonstrate the realization of a unique QSH phase possessing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states in altermagnetic multilayers. This exotic QSH phase, characterized by a mirror-spin Chern number, emerges from the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we identify altermagnetic Fe$_2$Se$_2$O multilayers as promising material candidates, in which the number of gapless helical edge states scales linearly with the number of layers, leading to a correspondingly large, exactly quantized, and experimentally accessible spin-Hall conductance. Our findings unveil a new mechanism for stabilizing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states, significantly expanding the scope of QSH effects, and provide a blueprint for utilizing altermagnetism to engineer desired topological phases.

High-temperature and high-pressure experiments were conducted on columbite-type ZnNb2O6, reaching temperatures up to 873 K at ambient pressure and pressures up to 30 GPa at ambient temperature, respectively. Through systematic analysis employing synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, we examined the crystal structure and phonon behavior. Within the specified temperature range, the orthorhombic phase of ZnNb2O6 (space group: Pbcn) demonstrated notable phase stability, with a thermal expansion coefficient similar to that of isomorphic compounds. Notably, a reversible phase transition was observed under compression at 10 GPa, with diffraction experiments indicating a shift to a monoclinic structure (space group P2/a), which remained stable up to 30 GPa. Changes in Raman modes, lattice parameters, and the unit-cell volume were monitored. A significant 2.5% discontinuity in the unit-cell volume at the phase transition pressure from orthorhombic to monoclinic suggests a first-order phase transition. The bulk moduli of the orthorhombic and monoclinic phases were estimated as 165(7) GPa and 230(9) GPa, respectively- We also found that both phases exhibit an anisotropic response to pressure. Furthermore, first-principles calculations support consistently with experimental observations.

A quantum mechanical Maxwell demon is proposed in a quantum dot setting. The demon avoids continuous-measurement induced decoherence by exploiting an undetailed charge detector. The control of coherent tunneling via Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana driving allows for efficient feedback operations with no work invested. The local violation of the second law achieves simultaneous power generation and cooling. We discuss the response current fluctuations, and the demon backaction deriving from failures, finding optimal performance in the nonadiabatic regime.

We present thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements for an orthopyroxene CoGeO$_3$ with magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions that form quasi-one-dimensional ladders. We show that non-collinear magnetic order below $T_N$=32 K can be stabilized by a strong local easy-axis anisotropy of $j_\text{eff}=1/2$ moments, which is induced by ligand octahedra distortions. Extraction of a magnetic Hamiltonian from inelastic neutron scattering measurements supports this interpretation and allows us to establish an effective magnetic model. The resulting exchange Hamiltonian justifies CoGeO$_3$ as a realization of an Ising spin ladder compound.

J. Austin Chunn, Ruotong Zhai, Daniel E. Sheehy
We study the low energy phonon dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with a density profile that is equivalent, via a coordinate transformation, to phonons traveling in a \lq\lq spherical\rq\rq\ curved spacetime that realizes the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. The metric of this BEC is characterized by its curvature $\kappa$ and a time-depdendent scale factor $a(t)$, with an increase in the latter corresponding to an expansion of the analog FLRW universe. We study the propagation of classical phonons in such BECs, finding that a sudden change in the scale factor induces ripples in the wave motion. In addition, we study quantum phonon creation (or vacuum amplification) due to the scale-factor modification and quantify their entanglement.

Yonit Hochberg, Dino Novko, Rotem Ovadia, Antonio Politano
We propose the use of several unconventional materials as detectors for dark matter with mass beneath the MeV scale. These include the transition-metal dichalcogenide TiSe$_2$ hosting a low-energy plasmon in the charge-density-wave phase, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ containing a low-energy acoustic demon mode, and hole-doped diamond with tunable optical and acoustic plasmon frequencies. We perform first-principles density functional theory computations of their loss functions at non-vanishing momenta and establish their reach into light dark matter parameter space. We show that due to intense low-energy plasmon modes -- of different microscopic origin in each -- the reach of detectors based on these materials could surpass existing proposals by several orders of magnitude for both dark matter scattering and absorption on electrons. The anisotropic response of these materials, which enables directional detection, renders them exceptionally strong detector candidates, motivating the design and fabrication of future devices.

Controlling the size of powder particles is pivotal in the design of many pharmaceutical forms and the related manufacturing processes and plants. One of the most common techniques for particle size reduction in process industry is powder milling, whose efficiency relates to the mechanical properties of powder particles themselves. In this work, we first characterize the elastic and plastic response of different pharmaceutical powders by measuring their Young modulus, the hardness and the brittleness index via nano-indentation. Subsequently, we analyze the behavior of those powder samples during comminution via jet-mill at different process conditions. Finally, the correlation between single particle mechanical properties and milling process results is illustrated; the possibility to build a predictive model for powder grindability, based on nano-indentation data, is critically discussed

Krishanu Ghosh, Sayan Choudhury, Diptiman Sen, K. Sengupta
We study a random and quasiperiodically driven one-dimensional non-integrable PXP spin chain in a magnetic field for two distinct drive protocols. Each of these protocols involves square pulses with two driving frequencies which are integer multiples of each other. For the first class of protocols, the duration of the pulse is changed randomly by an amplitude $dT$ while for the second class we use a random/quasiperiodic dipolar drive, where the quasiperiodicity is implemented using the Thue-Morse (TM) or Fibonacci sequences. For both protocols, we identify parameter regimes for which the thermalization of the driven chain is drastically slowed down due to proximity to a two-rate drive induced exact dynamical freezing. We also study the properties of these driven system moving slightly away from the freezing limit. For the first type of protocols, we show the existence of special value of $dT$ for which the thermalization rate remains small and provide an analytic explanation for such slow thermalization. For the second class of protocols, in contrast to random/quasiperiodic drives involving a single frequency studied earlier, we find that the TM quasiperiodic drive leads to a distinctly slower thermalization than that for drive protocols which are either periodic or follow a random or quasiperiodic Fibonacci sequence. We provide a qualitative semi-analytic understanding of these phenomena either using an exact calculation for small system sizes or carrying out a perturbative analysis in the large drive-amplitude limit. Our analysis brings out the central role of such two-frequency protocols in the reduction of heating in driven quantum systems. We discuss experiments which can test our theory.

[48]. [*Transition to chaos with conical billiards*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02786 "Transition to chaos with conical billiards")
Lara Braverman, David R. Nelson
We adapt ideas from geometrical optics and classical billiard dynamics to consider particle trajectories with constant velocity on a cone with specular reflections off an elliptical boundary formed by the intersection with a tilted plane, with tilt angle $\gamma$. We explore the dynamics as a function of $\gamma$ and the cone deficit angle $\chi$ that controls the sharpness of the apex, where a point source of positive Gaussian curvature is concentrated. We find regions of the ($\gamma, \chi$) plane where, depending on the initial conditions, either (A) the trajectories sample the entire cone base and avoid the apex region; (B) sample only a portion of the base region while again avoiding the apex; or (C) sample the entire cone surface much more uniformly, suggestive of ergodicity. The special case of an untilted cone displays only type A trajectories which form a ring caustic at the distance of closest approach to the apex. However, we observe an intricate transition to chaotic dynamics dominated by Type (C) trajectories for sufficiently large $\chi$ and $\gamma$. A Poincar\'e map that summarizes trajectories decomposed into the geodesic segments interrupted by specular reflections provides a powerful method for visualizing the transition to chaos. We then analyze the similarities and differences of the path to chaos for conical billiards with other area-preserving conservative maps.

Kabir Khanna, Romain Vasseur
Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement, especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions.

Because it is easily switched from insulator to metal either via chemical doping or electrical gating, silicon is at the core of modern information technology and remains a candidate platform for quantum computing. The metal-to-insulator transition in this material has therefore been one of the most studied phenomena in condensed matter physics, and has been revisited with considerable profit each time a new fabrication technology has been introduced. Here we take advantage of recent advances in creating ultra-thin layers of Bohr-atom-like dopants to realize the two-dimensional disordered Hubbard model at half-filling and its metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) as a function of mean distance between atoms. We use gas-phase dosing of dopant precursor molecules on silicon to create arsenic and phosphorus $\delta$-layers as thin as 0.4~nm and as dilute as 10$^{13}$~cm$^{-2}$. On approaching the insulating state, the conventional weak localization effects, prevalent at high dopant densities and due to orbital motion of the electrons in the plane, become dominated by electron-electron interaction contributions which obey a paramagnetic Zeeman scaling law. The latter make a negative contribution to the conductance, and thus cannot be interpreted in terms of an emergent Kondo regime near the MIT.

Abhishek Mund, Shubham S. Ganar, Arindam Das
In this current work, a comprehensive investigation into the impact dynamics of superhydrophobic and lubricant-impregnated aluminium sphere balls on liquid surfaces were carried out. The study delves into the hydrodynamic lubrication behavior and the resulting phenomena during impact. The Worthington jet and cavity associated give more insight into fundamental forces. The experimental analysis and theoretical modeling suggest potential applications in various fields such as fluid dynamics, tribology, and materials science. The stability investigation on an aluminum-textured sphere ball is carried out, and the evaluation of jet height and pinch-off phenomena is analyzed in detail. The experiment on entrapped air on a superhydrophobic surface and the oil inside the LIS for greater height was performed. The experimental setup involved a carefully designed apparatus for impact analysis by utilizing high-speed imaging techniques. Parameters such as impact velocity, Weber number, and sphere diameter were systematically varied to understand their influence on the observed dynamics. The lubricant viscosity is chosen such that it is comparable to water viscosity. Furthermore, the study on Lubricant Impregnated Surfaces (LIS) assessed frictional losses, i.e., drag reduction, compared to control and textured surfaces. In conclusion, the valuable insights into the impact dynamics advance our understanding of hydrodynamic lubrication and its applications. The findings presented here underscore the importance of further research in optimizing surface properties, selecting suitable lubricants, and exploring broader applications in the fields of fluid dynamics, surface engineering, and mechanical engineering.

Christopher Mastandrea, Costin Iancu, Hao Guo, Chih-Chun Chien
A spin-1 system can exhibit an intermediate-temperature topological regime with a quantized Uhlmann phase sandwiched by topologically trivial low- and high-temperature regimes. We present a quantum circuit consisting of system and ancilla qubits plus a probe qubit which prepares an initial state corresponding to the purified state of a spin-1 system at finite temperature, evolves the system according to the Uhlmann process, and measures the Uhlmann phase via expectation values of the probe qubit. Although classical simulations suggest the quantized Uhlmann phase is observable on IBM's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, an implementation of the circuit without any optimization exceeds the gate count for the error budget and results in unresolved signals. Through a series of optimization with Qiskit and BQSQit, the gate count can be substantially reduced, making the jumps of the Uhlmann phase more visible. A recent hardware upgrade of IBM quantum computers further improves the signals and leads to a clearer demonstration of interesting finite-temperature topological phenomena on NISQ hardware.

Italo L. Soares Andrade, Kleber Pirota, Amir O. Caldeira, Francisco Rouxinol
We report the observation of the Purcell effect in a cavity-metallic magnet hybrid system using electric-field-mediated coupling. In this configuration, microwave-induced axial currents in the microwire induce circular magnetic fields that drive the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the magnetized microwire. Field-dependent transmission and reflection spectroscopies reveal a clear cavity perturbation consistent with the Purcell regime, in which the magnetic loss rate exceeds the light-matter coupling strength. Despite the small magnetic volume ($\sim 10^{-13}\,\text{m}^3$), measurements performed at both room temperature and 7 mK show coupling rates as high as 56 MHz, one order of magnitude stronger than expected from conventional coupling at the magnetic antinode. Time-domain ringdown measurements directly show the magnetic-field-dependent modification of the cavity photon lifetime, in agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a versatile approach for coupling microwave fields to metallic magnets via geometric and electric-field-mediated interactions, opening new opportunities for hybrid cavity-magnet systems.

[*Simultaneous photonic and phononic bandgaps in a hexagonal lattice geometry with gradually transforming circular-to-triangular air gap holes*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03045 "Simultaneous photonic and phononic bandgaps in a hexagonal lattice geometry with gradually transforming circular-to-triangular air gap holes")
Suhas Bharadwaj, Adarsh Ganesan
The integration of photonic and phononic bandgaps within a single scalable architecture promises transformative advances in optomechanical and acousto-optic devices. Here, we design and simulate a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice in silicon with air-gap holes that transition smoothly from circular to triangular via tuneable geometrical parameters R and l. This transformation enables suppression of both electromagnetic and elastic wave modes through Bragg scattering and symmetry modulation. We demonstrate that systematic variation of R and l allows tuning of photonic and phononic bandgaps by 18% and 21% respectively. This possibility of geometrical tuning of bandgaps provide strong foundations for applications in Bragg filters, sensors etc. without the need for complex defects and exotic materials.

William Tuxbury, Lucas Fernandez-Alcazar, Tsampikos Kottos
We propose a new kind of physically realizable exceptional point degeneracies (EPDs) corresponding to synthetic reflectionless modes (SRM). These are solutions of an auxiliary wave operator that is defined in synthetic frequency dimensions and describe incoming reflectionless waves onto a Floquet-driven cavity. The SRM-EPD emerges as a consequence of a spontaneous local PT-symmetry imposed on the auxiliary operator via appropriate Floquet driving. Its presence signifies the possibility to design wavefronts and time-modulated schemes with up/down targeted frequency conversion and flat transmission spectra. The theory is validated via simulations with driven RF resonators.

Eunghyun Lee, Temirlan Raimbekov
We study one dimensional stochastic particle systems with exclusion interaction that each site can be occupied by at most one particle, and homogeneous jumping rates. Alimohammadi and Ahmadi previously classified 28 Yang-Baxter integrable two-particle interaction rules for the two species models with homogeneous rates. In this work, we show that 7 of these 28 cases can be naturally extended to integrable models with an arbitrary number of species $N \geq 2$. Moreover, we discover new integrable models with one or two parameters that generalize these 7 cases. For 8 of the remaining 21 cases, we propose an alternative extension scheme that yields integrable $N$ species models.

Kristian Arjas, Grazia Salerno, P\"aivi T\"orm\"a
Topology in photonics comes in two distinct flavors: global and local. Global topology considers invariants that are obtained by integrating over the energy band, whereas local topology considers defects, typically vortices, in the far-field emission. These topologies are described by a wide range of models built in both real and momentum space, which are connected only by computationally expensive numerical methods that lack physical intuition. Here we propose a general framework based on a real-space Hamiltonian capable of describing electric field as a vector in both near- and far fields, allowing us to bridge between topological defects in the far-field and global topological invariants. The proposed Hamiltonian is constructed from the symmetry-representations of the lattice, is deformable to both atomic localized-mode (tight-binding) and photonic delocalized-mode (long-range) limits, and allows for independent control over the energies of eigenmodes of different symmetries at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. This symmetry-based approach enables the design of structures with almost arbitrary topological properties and is not limited to photonic systems, but could apply to any system with engineered real-space couplings.

This study demonstrates that two-dimensional (2D) Bi2Te3 exhibits strong light-matter interaction, enabling a broadband Kerr nonlinear optical response. This characteristic is advantageous for nonreciprocal light propagation in passive photonic isolators. Using Spatial Self-Phase Modulation (SSPM) spectroscopy, self-induced diffraction patterns in the far field were observed at excitation wavelengths of 650 nm, 532 nm, and 405 nm to calculate the nonlinear refractive index (n2) and the third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (chi^(3)) of the synthesized 2D Bi2Te3.
  The results show that 2D Bi2Te3 possesses a significantly higher nonlinear refractive index than graphene. The laser-induced hole coherence effect is responsible for the large magnitude of the third-order nonlinear susceptibility. Surface engineering techniques were also employed to enhance the response speed of the photonic system.
  Complementary ab initio simulations were performed to gain further insight into the observed nonlinear behavior. Leveraging the strong Kerr nonlinearity of 2D Bi2Te3, a nonlinear photonic isolator that breaks time-reversal symmetry and enables unidirectional light propagation was demonstrated. This work establishes Bi2Te3 as a novel 2D material for nonlinear photonics, expanding its potential applications in detectors, modulators, and optical switches.

Severin Angerpointner, Richard Swiderski, Erwin Frey
Self-assembly processes in biological and synthetic biomolecular systems are often governed by the spatial separation of biochemical processes. While previous work has focused on optimizing self-assembly through fine-tuned reaction parameters or using phase-separated liquid compartments with fast particle exchange, the role of slow inter-compartmental exchange remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that slow particle exchange between reaction domains can enhance self-assembly efficiency through a cooperative mechanism: delay-facilitated assembly. Using a minimal model of irreversible self-assembly in two compartments with distinct reaction and exchange dynamics, we identify scenarios that maximize yield and minimize assembly time, even under conditions where isolated compartments would fail to facilitate any self-assembly. The mechanism relies on a separation of timescales between intra-compartmental reactions and inter-compartmental exchange and is robust across a wide range of geometries, including spatially extended domains with diffusive transport. We demonstrate that this effect enables geometric control of self-assembly processes through compartment volumes and exchange rates, eliminating the need for fine-tuning local reaction rates. These results offer a conceptual framework for leveraging spatial separation in synthetic self-assembly design and suggest that biological systems may use slow particle exchange to improve assembly efficiency.

Rahul Gupta, Huaiyang Yuan, Himadri Shekhar Dhar
We present a scheme for generating stable and tunable entanglement between two localized Bloch domain walls in nanomagnetic strips kept inside a chiral optical cavity. The entanglement is mediated by the effective optomechanical interaction between the cavity photons and the two macroscopic, collective modes of the pinned domain walls. By controlling the pinning potential and optical driving frequency, the robust, steady-state entanglement between the two macroscopic domain walls can survive beyond the typical milli-Kelvin temperature range.

We discuss the low-energy dynamics of massless Dirac fermions interacting with a propagating, relativistic photon in 2+1 spacetime dimensions, when we turn on a uniform magnetic field. This problem can be solved when the magnetic field is sufficiently strong. As observed previously, we find that the vacuum spontaneously breaks some of the global symmetries. We also determine the spectrum of excitations around this vacuum, and compute the resulting low-energy effective action. We use techniques that were previously developed for quantum Hall ferromagnets in condensed matter physics.

Small molecules that interact strongly with water were the subject of this molecular dynamics (MD) study. These solutes include a cryoprotectant (DMSO), a polyalcohol [CH$_2$(OH)$_2$], carboxylic acid conjugates (HCOOH and HCOONa), an ammonium salt (NH$_4$Cl), and two alkyl halide salts (NaCl and NaF). MD simulations were carried out for bulk supercooled liquids and solutions in contact with ice. Solute and water hydrogen bonding, orientational and translational order, and hydrogen bond jump dynamics were compared in bulk and as a function of distance from the solute molecules. Reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) simulations were used to determine interfacial widths, friction coefficients ($\kappa$) with ice, and solution phase viscosities ($\eta$). Ionic solutes were found to reduce orientational and translational ordering near the ice interfaces. However, in bulk liquids, we find a correlation between orientational ordering and the statistics of water hydrogen bonds -- a donor-acceptor imbalance in water has the greatest impact on ordering in the bulk liquids. Although ionic solutions exhibited similar effects on the water structure, the effect on dynamics depends most directly on donor-acceptor imbalance. Solutes that are hydrogen bond acceptors were found to slow hydrogen bond lifetimes relative to hydrogen bond donors. We also observed a direct correlation between the liquid phase hydrogen-bond jump times and shear viscosity. Finally, of all the solutes studied, only DMSO and sodium formate exhibited increased friction at the ice-water interface.

Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is an advanced cancer treatment modality that offers significant advantages over conventional X-ray therapies, particularly in its ability to minimize radiation dose beyond the tumor target. This reduction in unnecessary irradiation exposure significantly lowers the risk to surrounding healthy tissue and reduces side effects compared to conventional X-ray treatments. However, due to the high complexity of IMPT plans, each plan must be independently validated to ensure the safety and efficacy of the radiation exposure to the patient. While ion chambers are currently used for this purpose, their limitations-particularly in angled-beam measurements and multi-depth assessments-hinder their effectiveness. Silicon-based detectors, commonly used in X-ray therapy, are unsuitable for IMPT due to their rapid degradation under proton irradiation. In this study, a $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) detector was evaluated and compared with a commercial ion chamber using a MEVION S250i proton accelerator. The $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ detector demonstrated reliable detection of single-pulse proton doses as low as 0.26 MU and exhibited a linear charge-to-dose relationship across a wide range of irradiation conditions. Furthermore, its measurement variability was comparable to that of the ion chamber, with improved sensitivity observed at higher bias voltages. These results highlight the strong potential of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ as a radiation-hard detector material for accurate dose verification in IMPT.

Hironari Isshiki, Prasanta Muduli, Junyeon Kim, Kouta Kondou, YoshiChika Otani
We have developed a phenomenological model that connects the direct and the inverse Edelstein effects. Our model implies a trade-off relation between the conversion coefficients for the direct and inverse effects. Thus, a large conversion coefficient for the inverse effect does not necessarily bring a large conversion coefficient for the direct effect. Instead of these coefficients, we propose a figure of merit of Edelstein effects which consists of two factors; one of them represents the magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling, and the other represents the strength of the hybridization between bulk and interface states. Both of them are quit important for the efficient conversion through Edelstein effects. To test our model, we measured the inverse and direct Edelstein effects at the Bi2O3/Cu interface using spin absorption method with a non-local spin valve structure and calculated the conversion coefficients. The effective spin Hall angle reaches ~0.09 in this system. This relatively large value is attributable to not only the large spin-orbit coupling but also the strong hybridization between the interface and bulk states at the Bi2O3/Cu interface.

David H. Wolpert
One of the major resource requirements of computers - ranging from biological cells to human brains to high-performance (engineered) computers - is the energy used to run them. Those costs of performing a computation have long been a focus of research in physics, going back to the early work of Landauer. One of the most prominent aspects of computers is that they are inherently nonequilibrium systems. However, the early research was done when nonequilibrium statistical physics was in its infancy, which meant the work was formulated in terms of equilibrium statistical physics. Since then there have been major breakthroughs in nonequilibrium statistical physics, which are allowing us to investigate the myriad aspects of the relationship between statistical physics and computation, extending well beyond the issue of how much work is required to erase a bit. In this paper I review some of this recent work on the `stochastic thermodynamics of computation'. After reviewing the salient parts of information theory, computer science theory, and stochastic thermodynamics, I summarize what has been learned about the entropic costs of performing a broad range of computations, extending from bit erasure to loop-free circuits to logically reversible circuits to information ratchets to Turing machines. These results reveal new, challenging engineering problems for how to design computers to have minimal thermodynamic costs. They also allow us to start to combine computer science theory and stochastic thermodynamics at a foundational level, thereby expanding both.

Gen Yue, Longye Wang, Tian Lan
We review the condensation completion of a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$, which yields a fusion 2-category $\Sigma\mathcal{C}$ of separable algebras, bimodules over algebras and bimodule maps in $\mathcal{C}$. Physically, $\Sigma\mathcal{C}$ is the fusion 2-category of codimension-1 defects, codimension-2 defects and instantons in the $2+1$D topological order $\mathcal{C}$. We realize the rough-rough wall and $e$-$m$ exchange wall in Toric Code model on the lattice by deforming the Hamiltonian based on the corresponding algebraic data. We apply condensation completion to Toric Code, $3\mathbf{F}$, two-laryer semion and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological orders, and explicitly enumerate their $1$d and $0$d defects along with fusion rules. We also mention other applications of condensation completion: alternative interpretations of condensation completion of a braided fusion category; condensation completion of the category of symmetry charges and its correspondence to gapped phases with symmetry; for a topological order $\mathcal{C}$, one can find all gapped boundaries of the stacking of $\mathcal{C}$ with its time-reversal conjugate through computing the condensation completion of $\mathcal{C}$.

Longjun Xiang, Hao Jin, Jian Wang
We present the framework of \textit{spin quantum geometry}, which is fundamentally linked to the spin degree of freedom of Bloch electrons and incorporates both the spin quantum geometric tensor (QGT) and the recently introduced Zeeman QGT, to elucidate the spin transport. We show that the spin and Zeeman QGTs, respectively, provide a unified framework for revealing known spin currents, such as the intrinsic spin Hall effect, and spin magnetization, such as the Edelstein effect, of Bloch electrons under an electric field. In addition, we predict the linear displacement spin Hall effect, wherein an AC electric field induces a transverse spin current in insulating systems. Furthermore, we propose two novel nonlinear spin responses: the nonlinear Drude spin current (NDSC) and the nonlinear Drude spin magnetization (NDSM), both of which exhibit a quadratic dependence on the relaxation time, like the nonlinear Drude charge current, and are governed by the \textit{spin quantum geometry}. Finally, we evaluate the NDSC and NDSM with Dirac models of topological insulators and find that, in the moderately dirty regime, the NDSC and NDSM can exceed their respective nonlinear intrinsic counterparts, which have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics.

Oliver Franke, Duje Akrap, Piet W. Brouwer
Electron-magnon coupling at the interface between a normal metal and a magnetically ordered insulator modifies the electrical conductivity of the normal metal, an effect known as spin-Hall magnetoresistance. It can also facilitate magnon-mediated current drag, the nonlocal electric current response of two normal metal layers separated by a magnetic insulator. Additionally, spin and heat transport are coupled both in the magnetic insulator and across the interfaces to normal metals. In this article, we present a theory of these spintronic and spin-caloritronic effects for time-dependent applied electric fields $E(\omega)$, with driving frequencies $\omega$ up to the THz regime. Our model describes how the dominant transport mechanism, coherent or incoherent magnons, evolves with the driving frequency $\omega$.

Orazio Scarlatella, Nigel R. Cooper
Quantum emitter arrays have emerged as important platforms in which strong light-matter interactions can be achieved and precisely controlled. In subwavelength regimes, they are characterised by a manifold of subradiant eigenstates, which can host novel quantum many-body states and are promising for several applications. Nevertheless, their excitation under a weak far-field driving is prevented by their subradiant nature. Consequently, the weak-drive regime has been widely regarded as a linear regime, well described by classical equations. In this work, we find that, suprisingly, the weak-drive regime is instead strongly non-linear for regular geometries, due to the important contribution of higher-order, resonant and momentum-conserving processes exciting subradiant states. Using a Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) we show that these processes lead to a steady state of interacting subradiant excitation pairs, with quantum correlations of two-mode squeezing and long-range character, realising a novel strongly-correlated driven-dissipative state. These findings have potential impact for non-linear optics and quantum metrology.

Wei Qin, Wen-Xuan Qiu, Fengcheng Wu
Motivated by the recent observations of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$), we theoretically investigate the superconductivity driven by electronic mechanism. We first demonstrate that the multi-band screened Coulomb interaction within the random phase approximation is insufficient to induce observable pairing instability. Nevertheless, by further including the intervalley antiferromagnetic fluctuations, the pairing interaction is substantially enhanced, yielding superconductivity with critical temperature $T_c$ of hundreds of millikelvin at van Hove singularities. The predicted $T_c$ increases with increasing the displacement field and corresponds to a doubly-degenerate $d$-wave-like pairing, which evolves into topological chiral $d \pm id$ superconductor below $T_c$. The interplay between superconductivity and intervalley antiferromagnetism results in a phase diagram consistent with experimental observations.These findings establish intervalley fluctuations as the primary pairing glue in tWSe$_2$.

Chi Sun, Johanne Bratland Tjernshaugen, Jacob Linder
The superconducting version of a diode effect has been the subject of extensive research in the past few years. So far, the focus has almost exclusively been on charge transport, but a natural question is whether it is possible to obtain nonreciprocal spin transport without dissipation. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to generate electrically tunable nonreciprocal spin transport carried by a supercurrent using superconductor/ferromagnet multilayers. The nonreciprocal spin supercurrent reaches an ideal efficiency of 100%, meaning that the spin-polarization of the critical current is finite in one flow direction whereas it vanishes in the other direction. We explain the underlying physics generating this phenomenon. This result provides a way to integrate nonreciprocal supercurrents with spin-polarization, offering new functionality in quantum technologies based on Josephson junctions.

Marius Lemm, Bruno Nachtergaele, Simone Warzel, Amanda Young
Past studies of fractional quantum Hall systems have found that the charge gap dominates the neutral gap for all relevant parameter choices. We report a wide-ranging proof that this domination is in fact a universal property of any Hamiltonian that satisfies a few simple structural properties: translation-invariance, charge conservation, dipole conservation, and a fractionally filled ground state. The result applies to both fermions and bosons. Our main tool is a new mathematical scheme, the gap comparison method, which provides a sequence of inequalities that relate the spectral gaps in successive particle number sectors. Our finding sheds new light on dipole conservation's profound effects on many-body physics.

We consider the relaxation of finite-wavevector density waves in a facilitated classical lattice gas. Linear hydrodynamics predicts that such perturbations should relax exponentially, but nonlinear effects were predicted to cause subexponential relaxation via nonperturbative long-time tails. We present a detailed numerical study of this effect. While our results clearly indicate the importance of nonlinear effects, we find that the wavevector-dependence of the late-time relaxation is clearly inconsistent with theoretical predictions. We discuss manifestations of hydrodynamic nonlinearities in mesoscopic samples and at short times.

Ido Siovitz, Anna-Maria E. Gl\"uck, Yannick Deller, Alexander Schmutz, Felix Klein, Helmut Strobel, Markus K. Oberthaler, Thomas Gasenzer
Far from equilibrium, universal dynamics prevails in many different situations, from pattern coarsening to turbulence. A central longstanding problem concerns the development of a theory of coarsening that rests on the microscopic properties of the system and allows identifying the interaction mechanisms underlying a possible overarching universality class of the associated scaling dynamics. In quantum systems, this is complicated by the existence of nonlinear and topological excitations due to the compact nature of phase degrees of freedom. We show that the double sine-Gordon model as a noncompact low-energy effective model of the spin-1 Bose gas accounts for subdiffusive coarsening dynamics, identifying field configurations spread over multiple wells of the sinusoidal potential as a precondition for the slow scaling. This is in contrast to diffusion-type scaling which the model is known to exhibit as well, where field configurations are seen to not extend over more than two wells. Experimental observations of a spinor BEC support these characteristics, thus constituting a platform for the investigation of sine-Gordon dynamics. Our results point to a path towards a classification of pattern coarsening in many-body systems on the basis of microscopic models.

Naoya Katayama, Takahiro Sakaue
When probe molecules of interest are embedded in a container or aggregate under stochastic motion, one needs to rely on the so-called two-point mean square displacement (MSD) measurement to extract the intrinsic mobility of the probes. We discuss two versions, based on the time series of relative vector or distance between two probes, and summarize their basic properties compared to the standard MSD. We also propose a way to extract (i) the non-Gaussianity in the displacement statistics and (ii) the motional correlation between probes from the two-point MSD. The results are presented not only for independent probes, but also for intramolecular probes within a long polymer, which could be useful in quantifying the dynamics of chromatin loci in living cell nucleus.

Pritam Chatterjee, Vladimir Juri\v{c}i\'c
We propose a theoretical model to investigate the interplay between altermagnetism and $p$-wave superconductivity, with a particular focus on topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both chiral and helical phases. Our study reveals that the emergence of helical and chiral Majorana states can be tuned by the amplitude of a $d-$wave altermagnetic order parameter, with the outcome depending on the nature of the superconducting state. In the helical superconductor, such an altermagnet can induce a topological phase transition into a gapless topological superconductor hosting Majorana flat edge modes. On the other hand, in the chiral superconductor, the topological transition takes place between a topologically nontrivial gapped phase and a gapless nodal-line superconductor, where the Bogoliubov quasiparticle bands intersect at an isolated line in momentum space. Remarkably, we show that when such an altermagnet is coupled to a mixed-pairing superconductor, with both chiral and helical components, a hybrid topological phase emerges, featuring dispersive Majorana edge modes that coexist with nearly flat Majorana edge states. Our findings therefore establish a novel platform for controlling and manipulating Majorana modes in unconventional superconductors with vanishing total magnetization.

Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.

Nandagopal Manoj
A 2+1D superfluid in a rapidly rotating trap forms an array of vortices, with collective excitations called Tkachenko modes. Du et al. (2024) argued from an effective field theory viewpoint that these excitations are described by a field theory living on a non-commutative space. We elucidate the microscopic origin of these non-commutative fields, and present a novel derivation of the effective field theory for this superfluid using a lowest Landau level projected coherent state path integral approach. Besides conceptual clarity, this approach makes quantitative predictions about the long-wavelength, low-energy behavior in terms of the microscopic parameters of the short-range interacting lowest Landau level superfluid -- relevant to trapped Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.

Wen-Xuan Qiu, Fengcheng Wu
We theoretically investigate the magnetic excitations in the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at a hole filling factor of $\nu=1$, focusing on magnon and domain wall excitations. Using a generalized interacting Kane-Mele model, we obtain the quantum anomalous Hall insualtor ground state with spin polarization. The magnon spectrum is then computed via the Bethe-Salpeter equation, revealing two low-energy topological magnon bands with opposite Chern numbers. To further explore the magnon topology, we construct a tight-binding model for the magnon bands, which is analogous to the Haldane model. We also calculate the energy cost of domain walls that separate regions with opposite Chern numbers and bind chiral edge states. Finally, we propose an effective spin model that describes both magnon and domain wall excitations, incorporating Heisenberg spin interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The coupling constants in this model are determined from the numerical results for magnons and domain walls. This model accounts for the Ising anisotropy of the system, captures the magnon topology, and allows for the estimation of the magnetic ordering temperature. Our findings provide a comprehensive analysis of magnetic excitations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and offer new insights into collective excitations in moir\'e systems.

[*Energy profile and hopping barriers for small electron polarons at ferroelectric domain walls in bismuth ferrite from first principles*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04394 "Energy profile and hopping barriers for small electron polarons at ferroelectric domain walls in bismuth ferrite from first principles")
Sabine K\"orbel
Evidence from first-principles calculations indicates that excess electrons in BiFeO$_3$ form small polarons with energy levels deep inside the electronic band gap. Hence, $n$-type electronic transport could occur by hopping of small electron polarons rather than by band-like transport. Here, by means of first-principles calculations, small electron polaron hopping in BiFeO$_3$ is investigated. Both bulk BiFeO$_3$ and a typical ferroelectric domain wall, the neutral 71{\deg} domain wall, are considered. The latter is included to account for experimental observations of electrical conductivity at domain walls in otherwise insulating ferroelectrics. The object of this study is to shed light on the intrinsic electron conduction in rhombohedral BiFeO$_3$ and the effect of pristine neutral ferroelectric domain walls. The computed energy barriers for small electron polaron hopping are near 0.2 eV, similar to other perovskite oxides, both in the bulk and within the neutral 71\deg\ domain wall. Trapping energies of small electron polarons at the three prevalent domain walls, the 71\deg, the 109\deg, and the 180\deg\ wall, were determined. The domain walls are found to act as two-dimensional traps for small electron polarons, with a trap depth of about two times the thermal energy at room temperature. Based on these findings, the intrinsic $n$-type mobility and the diffusion constant in BiFeO$_3$ at room temperature are estimated, and experimental conductivity data for BiFeO$_3$ are discussed.

Abhijat Sarma, Yimu Bao, Nayan Myerson-Jain, Thomas Kiely, Cenke Xu
We demonstrate that the fidelity between two states with different Chern numbers $\mathcal Z = \mathrm{tr} \{ \rho \rho' \} $ serves as a generating theory for an effective conformal field theory (CFT) at the $(2+0)d$ temporal interface. $\rho$ can be chosen as a pure trivial insulator, and $\rho'$ can be taken as a pure or dephased Chern insulator density matrix. More specifically, we obtain the following results: (1) through evaluation of the effective central charge, stiffness, and correlation function (the ``strange correlators"), we demonstrate that the fidelity between a trivial insulator and an insulator with Chern number $C=1$ maps to a CFT with effective central charge $c_{\rm eff} = 1$; while the fidelity between two Chern insulators with Chern numbers $C = \pm 1$ maps to a CFT with $c_{\rm eff} = 2$. (2) The density matrix of the Chern insulator becomes a quantum spin Hall insulator in the doubled Hilbert space, and the dephasing acts as interaction between the two spin species. (3) In the limit of infinite dephasing the Chern insulator becomes a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert space, featuring the ``strong-weak" U(1) spontaneous symmetry breaking. The analysis based on Laughlin wave function and previous studies of projected wave function of quantum spin Hall insulator suggest this is a power-law superconductor. (4) With increasing strength of dephasing, the amplitude of single particle strange correlator is suppressed, while the Cooper pair strange correlator is enhanced, consistent with the trend of emerging superconductivity.

Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have greatly extended the reach of atomic-scale simulations, offering the accuracy of first-principles calculations at a fraction of the cost. Leveraging large quantum mechanical databases and expressive architectures, recent ''universal'' models deliver qualitative accuracy across the periodic table but are often biased toward low-energy configurations. We introduce PET-MAD, a generally applicable MLIP trained on a dataset combining stable inorganic and organic solids, systematically modified to enhance atomic diversity. Using a moderate but highly-consistent level of electronic-structure theory, we assess PET-MAD's accuracy on established benchmarks and advanced simulations of six materials. Despite the small training set and lightweight architecture, PET-MAD is competitive with state-of-the-art MLIPs for inorganic solids, while also being reliable for molecules, organic materials, and surfaces. It is stable and fast, enabling the near-quantitative study of thermal and quantum mechanical fluctuations, functional properties, and phase transitions out of the box. It can be efficiently fine-tuned to deliver full quantum mechanical accuracy with a minimal number of targeted calculations.

Jos\'e Giral-Barajas, Paul C Bressloff
We study the accumulation of resources within a target due to the interplay between continual delivery, driven by 1D stochastic search processes, and sequential consumption. The assumption of sequential consumption is key because it changes the commonly used $G/M/\infty$ queue to a $G/M/c$ queue. Combining the theory of $G/M/c$ queues with the theory of first-passage times, we derive general conditions for the search process to ensure that the number of resources within the queue converges to a steady state and compute explicit expressions for the mean and variance of the number of resources within the queue at steady state. We then compare the performance of the $G/M/c$ queue with that of the $G/M/\infty$ queue for an increasing number of servers. We extend the model to consider two competing targets and show that, under specific scenarios, an additional target is beneficial to the original target. Finally, we study the effects of multiple searchers. Using renewal theory, we numerically compute the inter-arrival time density for $M$ searchers in the Laplace space, which allows us to exploit the explicit expressions for the steady-state statistics of the number of resources within $G/M/1$ and $G/M/\infty$ queues, and compare their behaviour with different numbers of searchers. Overall, the $G/M/c$ queue shows a tighter dependence on the configuration of the search process than the $G/M/\infty$ queue does.

Finn L. Temmen, Evan Berkowitz, Anthony Kennedy, Thomas Luu, Johann Ostmeyer, Xinhao Yu
A sensible application of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method is often hindered by the presence of large - or even infinite - potential barriers. These potential barriers separate the configuration space into distinct sectors and can lead to ergodicity violations that bias measurements. In this work, we address this problem by augmenting HMC with a multiplicative Metropolis-Hastings update in a so-called ''radial direction'' of the fields which enables crossing the potential barriers and ensures ergodicity of the sampling algorithm at comparably low computational cost. We demonstrate the algorithm on a simple toy model and show how it can be applied to the fermionic Hubbard model describing physics ranging from an exactly-solvable two-site system to the $C_{20}H_{12}$ perylene molecule. Our numerical results show that the radial updates successfully remove ergodicity violations, while simultaneously reducing autocorrelation times.

R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, Mehdi Biderang, Jesko Sirker
We investigate the effects of uncorrelated noise on dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in fermionic two-band models following a quantum ramp across critical points. We consider a generalized Loschmidt echo for the noise-averaged density matrix $\bar\rho$, which is a mixed state in general, as well as the pure state Loschmidt echo calculated for each noise realization with the average performed over the corresponding return rates. $\bar\rho$ can be obtained from a master equation and we show that for two-band models noise destroys its coherences which typically drives $\bar\rho$ towards the completely mixed state which is an attractive fixed point. DQPTs are thus always smoothed out for finite noise. For single noise realizations, on the other hand, we find that DQPTs under certain conditions are always present irrespective of the noise level. This leads to remarkable stable though slightly broadened DQPT-like features in the averaged return rate. We illustrate our results for the XY model by considering a noisy ramp as well as noise in the energy levels of the final Hamiltonian.

Ashland Knowles, R. Ganesh
Dimer models are well known as prototypes for locally constrained physics. They describe systems in which every site on a lattice must be attached to one dimer. Loop models are an extension of this idea, with the constraint that two dimers must touch at each site. Here, we present a further generalization where every site must have three dimers attached -- a trivalent network model. As concrete physical realizations, we discuss d$^3$ transition metal dichalcogenides in the 1T structure -- materials with the structural formula MX$_2$ (M = Tc, Re) or AM$'$X$_2$ (A = Li or Na; M$'$ = Mo, W), where X is a chalcogen atom. These materials have a triangular layer of transition metal atoms, each with three valence electrons in $t_{2g}$ orbitals. Each atom forms valence bonds with three of its nearest neighbours. The geometry of the 1T structure imbues each bond with sharp orbital character. We argue that this enforces a ``bending constraint'' so that two dimers attached to the same site cannot be parallel. This leads to a highly structured space of configurations, with alternating bonds along each line of the underlying triangular lattice. There is no dynamics, as constraints forbid local rearrangements of dimers. We construct a phase diagram, identifying configurations that minimize potential energy. We find a rhombus-stripe phase that explains a distortion pattern seen across several materials. Remarkably, the local constraints in this model lead to a simple example of holography. The bonding configuration in the bulk is completely determined by the configuration at the boundary. We recast the model in terms of three Ising chains that are defined on the boundaries of a triangular cluster. As a testable prediction, we propose that a single impurity will generate long-ranged domain walls.

David M T Kuo
In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of 13-11-13 and 15-13-15 armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) superlattices (SLs) using a tight-binding model. We demonstrate that the conduction and valence subbands of 15-13-15 AGNR SLs can be accurately described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, with topologically protected interface states emerging at the junctions between 15-AGNR and 13-AGNR segments. These interface states enable the formation of quantum dot arrays with energy levels well separated from bulk states, making them promising candidates for high-temperature solid-state quantum processors. For 15-13-15 AGNRH segments, we observe both localized zigzag edge states and topologically protected interface states under longitudinal electric fields, with the latter providing efficient tunneling channels in contrast to the less conductive edge states. We further explore nonlinear charge transport through these interface states under Pauli spin blockade, showing that tunneling current spectra reveal charge stability diagrams and Coulomb blockade oscillations, consistent with experimental findings in other serial double quantum dot systems. Additionally, we examine the impact of orbital offsets on tunneling current rectification and demonstrate that significant current rectification is achieved over a wide temperature range when level broadening is optimized. These results highlight the potential of 15-13-15 AGNRHs for robust spin-current conversion and applications in quantum devices, offering advantages over other proposed structures due to precise tunability of key parameters via bottom-up synthesis techniques and the ease of two-gate electrode integration.

[89]. [*Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09553 "Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates")
S. S. Gavrilov
We consider coherent states of weakly interacting bosons under the conditions of external resonant excitation, with a focus on a two-dimensional polariton fluid driven by a plane electromagnetic wave near the ground state. The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction.

We extend the previously defined many-body marker for two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators [I. Gilardoni {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 106}, L161106 (2022)] to distinguish trivial, weak-, and strong-topological insulators in three dimensions, in presence of the inversion symmetry. The marker is written in term of ground-state expectation values of position operators and can be employed to detect topological phases of interacting systems beyond mean-field approximations, e.g., within quantum Monte Carlo techniques. Here, we show that the correct results of the non-interacting limit are reproduced by the many-body marker.

Collective turns in starling flocks propagate linearly with negligible attenuation, indicating the existence of an underdamped sector in the dispersion relation. Beside granting linear propagation of the phase perturbations, the real part of the frequency should also yield a spin-wave form of the unperturbed correlation function. However, new high-resolution experiments on real flocks show that underdamped traveling waves coexist with an overdamped Lorentzian correlation. Theory and experiments are reconciled once we add to the dynamics a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou term.

Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image, underpinning diverse functionalities across all scales of matter-from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover two universal geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. These mechanisms operate effectively even in amorphous chiral media under isotropic illumination and persist at weak spin-orbit coupling, underscoring fundamental aspects of spin-chirality interplay. We further identify an unreported phenomenon central to CISS: locking of photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. Our findings provide a unified geometric framework with broad implications, extending from CISS and asymmetric catalysis to spin textures in chiral crystals and chiral quantum materials such as Weyl semimetals.

We resort to first-principles molecular dynamics, in synergy with experiments, to study structural evolution and Na$^+$ cation diffusion inside (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ (x = 0.10-0.40) glasses. Experimental and modeling results show a fair quantitative agreement in terms of total X-ray structure factors and pair distribution functions, thereby setting the ground for a comprehensive analysis of the glassy matrix evolution. We find that the structure of (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ glasses deviates drastically from that of pure TeO$_2$ glass. Specifically, increasing the Na$_2$O concentration leads to a reduction of the coordination number of Te atoms, reflecting the occurrence of a structural depolymerization upon introduction of the Na$_2$O modifier oxide. The depolymerization phenomenon is ascribed to the transformation of Te-O-Te bridges into terminal Te-O non bridging oxygen atoms (NBO). Consequently, the concentration of NBO increases in these systems as the concentration of the modifier increases, accompanied by a concomitant reduction in the coordination number of Na atoms. The structure factors results show a prominent peak at 1.4 A, that becomes more and more pronounced as the Na2O concentration increases. The occurrence of this first sharp diffraction peak is attributed to the growth of Na-rich channels inside the amorphous network, acting as preferential routes for alkali-ion conduction inside the relatively stable Te-O matrix. These channels enhance the ion mobility.

Colloidal particles at fluid interfaces can enhance the stability of drops and bubbles. Yet, their effect on mass transfer in these multiphase systems remains ambiguous, with some experiments reporting strongly hindered diffusion, while others show nearly no effect, even at near-complete surface coverage. To resolve this ambiguity, we solve the Fick-Jacobs equation for unsteady diffusion, allowing us to treat the particle-laden interface as a locally reduced cross-sectional area for mass transfer. Our numerical solutions reveal two limiting regimes, with the particle layer hindering diffusion only at short times. Guided by analytical solutions for a homogeneous layer with reduced diffusivity, we derive quantitative expressions for the transport regimes and associated transition times for diffusion across the particle layer. This analysis yields a simple criterion for long-term hindrance that accurately distinguishes between conflicting experimental results, providing a unifying framework for mass transfer in particle-laden multiphase systems.

This review synthesizes recent advancements in the study of moir\'e magnetism. This emerging field, at the intersection of twistronics, topology, and strongly correlated systems, explores novel phenomena that arise when moir\'e potentials influence the magnetism of two-dimensional systems. The manuscript presents recent advances highlighting the interfacial incongruity as a novel mechanism for regulating the magnetism of two-dimensional materials and for the manifestation of various phenomena in twisted and mismatched magnetic two-dimensional interfaces. The manuscript addresses seminal and recent experimental and theoretical advances associated with both small- and large-period magnetic moir\'e lattices, including novel magnetic phases, low-energy and topological magnetic excitations, magnetic and electronic transport, optical properties, phase transitions, and prospective applications of these materials. Moir\'e magnetism signifies a promising frontier for manipulating complex quantum states in quantum matter.

Radiation hardness of scintillating nanocomposites consisting of inorganic scintillating nanocrystalline powders dispersed in organic matrices was studied under electron, X-ray and {\gamma}-ray irradiation. Samples including pure press-compacted pellets of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce, and the nanocomposites of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce embedded in polystyrene matrix with different fillings were investigated. Effects of radiation on radioluminescence and other optical properties of studied materials were evaluated. Bright burn effect related to nanocrystalline powder scintillators was observed at lower doses. Radiation damage in nanocomposite materials is related to the formation of radicals in polystyrene matrix. Extent of radiation damage decreases with ZnO:Ga filling. Presented results show the importance of systematic and complex study of the radiation stability of composite scintillators.

The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.

[98]. [*Natural super-orbitals representation of many-body operators*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10690 "Natural super-orbitals representation of many-body operators")
Maxime Debertolis
We introduce the concept of natural super-orbitals for many-body operators, defined as the eigenvectors of the one-body super-density matrix associated with a vectorized operator. We relate these objects to measures of non-Gaussianity of operators associated to the occupations of the natural super-orbitals, and define how the non-stabilizerness of operators can be affected by such a basis rotation. We first analyze the general analytical properties of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution operator of non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then perform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding to both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing on two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity model, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the $t\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity model, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay exponentially at all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals contribute significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact matrix-product-operator representation and a reduced non-stabilizerness in the natural orbital basis. Finally, we examine the spatial spread of the natural orbitals for time-evolved local operators in the impurity model and show that the complexity of this operator in the natural orbital basis saturates over time. This new framework opens the door to future research that leverages the compressed structure of operators in their natural super-orbital basis, enabling for instance the computation of out-of-time-order correlators in large interacting systems over extended time scales.

Hesam Arabzadeh, Carol Griswold Hoover, William Graham Hoover
We revisit a two-temperature Nos\'e-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners at $(x,y) = (\pm 1, \pm 1)$ to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, grows nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy and follows a superquadratic power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, deviating from linear-response theory, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2}$. We compare this behavior to a quartic correction to the linear-response prediction and discuss both fits in light of their empirical and theoretical implications. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear dissipation scaling emerges naturally even in minimal driven systems. The approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension reveals a fractal attractor that concentrates as $|T_x - T_y|$ increases. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.

Haoshen Ye, Shuai Dong
Twisting layers provide a rich ore for exotic physics in low dimensions. Despite the abundant discoveries of twistronics from the aspect of electronic structures, ferroic moir\'e textures are more plain and thus less concerned. Rigid lattice models are straightforward which can give a rough but intuitional description in most cases. However, taking CrI$_3$ as a model system, here we will demonstrate that the interlayer stacking potential can spontaneously lead to structural relaxation, which plays a vital role to understand the ferroicity in the twisted superlattices. The magnetic ground state is sensitive to the stacking mode and twisting angles, which can be seriously affected by the structural relaxation. In particular, the expected magnetic bubbles are annihilated in its bilayer. In contrast, due to topological protection, the ferroelectric vortices are more robust to structural relaxation, as well as twisting angle and thickness.Due to the universal existence of spontaneous structural relaxation in twisted superlattices, our work may lead to a general revisitation of emerging physics of twistronics.

Granular materials exhibit intricate force networks, often concentrated in chains rather than being uniformly distributed. These meso-scale structures are complex to characterize, owing to their heterogeneous and anisotropic nature. We present a topological analysis in which we characterize force networks by studying the connectivity of contact forces in granular materials. We obtain the force network data during the isotropic compression of a 2D granular ensemble, which comprises of bidisperse photoelastic disks. The force chains are visualized using a bright-field polariscope, which are then analyzed using photoelasticity techniques to get contact force information across all the particles in the granular ensemble. The forces and contact network are studied using topological descriptors. We analyze the evolution of these descriptors using methods developed in the areas of computational topology and persistent homology. Specifically, we evaluate the number of homology class generators to capture critical changes in network connectivity with the evolution of packing fraction. Building on previous applications of persistent homology, our topological analysis of the force network provides valuable insights by distinguishing different phases of particle interactions and revealing unique structural transitions around jamming and thus help enhance our understanding of the stability and jamming dynamics in granular systems.

Exploring the intricate interplay between magnetism and charge density waves has long been a fundamental pursuit at the forefront of condensed matter research. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we propose for the first time that anomalous charge density wave can be realized in two-dimensional altermagnetic WO. The anomalous charge density wave is characterized by three key features: (i) Unlike conventional charge density wave, whose stabilization is driven by the opening of a gap near the Fermi level, the anomalous charge density wave is stabilized by the occupied states with energies shifting lower far away from the Fermi level; (ii) the anomalous charge density wave increases the density of states near the Fermi level and then enhances-rather than diminishes-the metallicity of materials; (iii) altermagnetism plays a crucial role in stabilizing anomalous charge density wave. Thus, our work offers a pathway for exploring both the realization and the underlying mechanisms of anomalous charge density waves in magnetic systems.

Discontinuity of dielectric constants at the interface is a common feature of all nanostructures and semiconductor heterostructures. Near such interfaces, a charged particle creates a singular self-interaction potential which may be attributed to interaction with fictitious mirror charges. The singularity of this interaction at the interface presents an obstruction to a perturbative approach. In several limiting cases, this problem can be avoided by zeroing out the carrier wave function at the interface. In this paper, we developed a non-perturbative theory which gives a self-consistent description of carrier propagation through an interface with dielectric discontinuity. It is based on conservation of the current density propagating through the interface, and it is formulated in terms of general boundary conditions (GBC) for the wave function at the interface with a single phenomenological parameter W. For these GBC, we find exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation near the interface and the carrier energy spectrum including resonances. Using these results, we describe the photo effect at the semiconductor/vacuum interface and the electron energy spectrum in the interface quantum well, as well as the dependence of these two phenomena on the interface parameter W.

Recent studies have drawn growing attention on non-relativistic odd-parity magnetism in the wake of altermagnets. Nevertheless, odd-parity spin splitting is often believed to appear in non-collinear magnetic configurations. Here, using symmetry arguments and effective model analysis, we show that Floquet engineering offers a universal strategy for achieving odd-parity magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) collinear antiferromagnets under irradiation of periodic driving light fields such as circularly polarized light, elliptically polarized light, and bicircular light. A comprehensive classification of potential candidates for collinear monolayer or bilayer antiferromagnets is established. Strikingly, the light-induced odd-parity spin splitting can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the crystalline symmetry or the polarization state of incident light, enabling the reversal or conversion of spin-splitting. By combining first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we present illustrative examples of 2D collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials to verify the light-induced odd-parity magnetism. Our work not only offers a powerful approach for uniquely achieving odd-parity spin-splitting with high tunability, but also expands the potential of Floquet engineering in designing unconventional compensated magnetism.

We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.

T. Karabassov, I. V. Bobkova, A. M. Bobkov, A. S. Vasenko, A. A. Golubov
We develop a linear response theory for the dynamical proximity effect in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) hybrid structures. Our approach combines the nonequilibrium quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel equations for the electronic Green's functions in the TS with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation governing the magnetization dynamics in the FI. Within this framework, we study the proximity-induced coupling between magnons and superconducting collective excitations. We find that the spin-momentum locking intrinsic to the surface state of the TS leads to a hybridization between the superconducting Nambu-Goldstone (phase) collective mode and magnons, resulting in the emergence of composite magnon-Nambu-Goldstone excitations. The dependence of the coupling strength on relevant physical parameters is analyzed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, we show that the Higgs (amplitude) mode does not couple to magnons at linear order and therefore does not participate in the formation of hybrid collective excitations.

Many combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are naturally expressed using variables that take on more than two discrete values. To solve such problems using Ising machines (IMs) - specialized analog or digital devices designed to solve COPs efficiently - these multi-valued integers must be encoded using binary spin variables. A common approach is one-hot encoding, where each variable is represented by a group of spins constrained so that exactly one spin is in the "up" state. However, this encoding introduces energy barriers: changing an integer's value requires flipping two spins and passing through an invalid intermediate state. This creates rugged energy landscapes that may hinder optimization. We propose a higher-order Ising formulation for Max-3-Cut, which is the smallest fundamental COP with multi-valued integer variables. Our formulation preserves valid configurations under single-spin updates. The resulting energy landscapes are smoother, and we show that this remains true even when the binary variables are relaxed to continuous values, making it well-suited for analog IMs as well. Benchmarking on such an IM, we find that the higher-order formulation leads to significantly faster solutions than the Ising baseline. Interestingly, we find that an empirical rescaling of some terms in the Ising formulation - a heuristic proposed in prior work - approaches the performance of the higher-order Ising formulation, underscoring the importance of empirical parameter tuning in COP encodings.

Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15425 "Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain")
J\'ozef Ku\'sba
To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The agreement between the basic expressions of the TRMC method and the analogous expressions of the renewal theory has been demonstrated. The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail.

Julian B. Voits (Heidelberg University), Ulrich S. Schwarz (Heidelberg University)
Biological systems are remarkably susceptible to relatively small temperature changes. The most obvious example is fever, when a modest rise in body temperature of only few Kelvin has strong effects on our immune system and how it fights pathogens. Another very important example is climate change, when even smaller temperature changes lead to dramatic shifts in ecosystems. Although it is generally accepted that the main effect of an increase in temperature is the acceleration of biochemical reactions according to the Arrhenius equation, it is not clear how it affects large biochemical networks with complicated architectures. For developmental systems like fly and frog, it has been shown that the system response to temperature deviates in a characteristic manner from the linear Arrhenius plot of single reactions, but a rigorous explanation has not been given yet. Here we use a graph-theoretical interpretation of the mean first-passage times of a biochemical master equation to give a statistical description. We find that in the limit of large system size and if the network has a bias towards a target state, then the Arrhenius plot is generically quadratic, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations for large networks as well as with experimental data for developmental times in fly and frog. We also discuss under which conditions this generic response can be violated, for example for linear chains, which have only one spanning tree.

Stephon Alexander, Heliudson Bernardo, Humberto Gilmer
We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.

Tobias Haug, Leandro Aolita, M. S. Kim
Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on R\'enyi index $\alpha$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $\alpha$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $\alpha>1$, while is a constant for $\alpha<1$. This highlights that $\alpha$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $\alpha$: $\alpha$-SREs with $\alpha<1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $\alpha>1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.

F. S. Pezzicoli, V. Ros, F. P. Landes, M. Baity-Jesi
Class imbalance (CI) is a longstanding problem in machine learning, slowing down training and reducing performances. Although empirical remedies exist, it is often unclear which ones work best and when, due to the lack of an overarching theory. We address a common case of imbalance, that of anomaly (or outlier) detection. We provide a theoretical framework to analyze, interpret and address CI. It is based on an exact solution of the teacher-student perceptron model, through replica theory. Within this framework, one can distinguish several sources of CI: either intrinsic, train or test imbalance. Our analysis reveals that the optimal train imbalance is generally different from 50%, with a non trivial dependence on the intrinsic imbalance, the abundance of data and on the noise in the learning. Moreover, there is a crossover between a small noise training regime where results are independent of the noise level to a high noise regime where performances quickly degrade with noise. Our results challenge some of the conventional wisdom on CI and offer practical guidelines to address it.

Yixin Guo, Tomoya Naito, Hiroyuki Tajima, Haozhao Liang
We theoretically investigate Cooper quartet correlations in $ N = Z $ doubly-magic nuclei ($ {}^{40} \mathrm{Ca} $, $ {}^{100} \mathrm{Sn} $, and $ {}^{164} \mathrm{Pb} $). We first examine the quartet condensation fraction in infinite symmetric nuclear matter by using the quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. Together with the total nucleon density profiles of doubly-magic nuclei obtained from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation, we discuss the spatial distribution of quartet correlations in finite nuclei within the local density approximation. Large quartet condensate fractions are found at the surface region of an atomic nucleus due to the strong neutron-proton attractive interaction responsible for the deuteron formation in vacuum. Moreover, we discuss a possible microscopic origin of the Wigner term in the context of nucleon-quartet scattering in dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The nucleon-quartet scattering effect on the Wigner term is numerically estimated to be about one order of magnitude of the total empirical strength, indicating the importance of multinucleon clusters in the symmetry energy and mass formula in addition to the neutron-proton pairing.

Nonstabilizerness, also known as quantum magic, quantifies the deviation of quantum states from stabilizer states, capturing the complexity necessary for quantum computational advantage. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of quantum magic in disordered many-body localized (MBL) systems using the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). Leveraging a phenomenological description based on the $\ell$-bit model, we analytically and numerically demonstrate that interactions profoundly influence magic spreading, inducing a power-law growth of SRE that markedly contrasts with the rapid saturation observed in ergodic systems. We validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of the disordered transverse-field Ising model, showing excellent agreement across various disorder strengths, system sizes, and initial states. Additionally, we uncover a universal relationship between SRE and entanglement entropy, revealing their common scaling in the MBL regime independent of disorder strength and system size. Our results offer critical insights into the interplay of disorder, interactions, and complexity in quantum many-body systems.

[115]. [*On the generalized Langevin equation and the Mori projection operator technique*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20457 "On the generalized Langevin equation and the Mori projection operator technique")
Christoph Widder, Johannes Zimmer, Tanja Schilling
In statistical physics, the Nakajima-Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism is used to derive an integro-differential equation for observables in a Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. However, the well-posedness of the abstract Cauchy problem for the orthogonal dynamics remains an open problem. Moreover, it is rarely discussed under which assumptions the Dyson identity, which is used to derive the GLE, holds. In this article, we address this issue for rank-one projections (Mori's projection).
  For the Mori projection, the orthogonal dynamics is obtained from the bounded perturbation theorem. The variation of constants formula for strongly continuous semigroups then yields the GLE and the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT). We show that the variation of constants can be replaced by a limiting process in order to give a general proof of the GLE and 2FDT that does not require the differentiability of the fluctuating forces.
  In addition, we offer an alternative approach that does not require the bounded perturbation theorem. Our starting point is the observation that the GLE and 2FDT uniquely determine the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. Furthermore, the orbit maps for the orthogonal dynamics can be directly defined via solutions of linear Volterra equations. All desired properties of the orthogonal dynamics are then proven directly from this definition. In particular, the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\overline{\mathcal{QL}}\mathcal{Q}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\mathcal{P}=1-\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator.
  Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup.

Architecture design and optimization are challenging problems in the field of artificial neural networks. Working in this context, we here present SPARCS (SPectral ARchiteCture Search), a novel architecture search protocol which exploits the spectral attributes of the inter-layer transfer matrices. SPARCS allows one to explore the space of possible architectures by spanning continuous and differentiable manifolds, thus enabling for gradient-based optimization algorithms to be eventually employed. With reference to simple benchmark models, we show that the newly proposed method yields a self-emerging architecture with a minimal degree of expressivity to handle the task under investigation and with a reduced parameter count as compared to other viable alternatives.

Cold Rydberg atoms trapped in an array of optical tweezers can be manipulated using laser light. We investigate the fate of out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics in a model of Rydberg atoms arranged in a square ladder geometry within the strong blockade regime, with a detuning profile staggered along the longer direction. As the staggering strength is tuned, the model exhibits a wide class of dynamical phenomena, ranging from quantum many-body scars, integrability-induced slow dynamics and approximate Krylov fractures. Furthermore, by leveraging the chiral nature of the spectrum, we design Floquet protocols which result in dynamical signatures reminiscent of discrete-time-crystalline order and exact Floquet-flat-bands.

The field of superconducting qubits is constantly evolving with new circuit designs. However, when it comes to qubit readout, the use of simple transverse linear coupling remains overwhelmingly prevalent. This standard readout scheme has significant drawbacks: in addition to the Purcell effect, it suffers from a limitation on the maximal number of photons in the readout mode, which restricts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) nature of the readout. Here, we explore the high-power regime by engineering a nonlinear coupling between a transmon qubit and its readout mode. Our approach builds upon previous work by Dassonneville et al. [Physical Review X 10, 011045 (2020)], on qubit readout with a non-perturbative cross-Kerr coupling in a transmon molecule. We demonstrate a readout fidelity of 99.21% with 89 photons utilizing a parametric amplifier. At this elevated photon number, the QND nature remains high at 96.7%. Even with up to 300 photons, the QNDness is only reduced by a few percent. This is qualitatively explained by deriving a critical number of photons associated with the nonlinear coupling, yielding a theoretical value of $\bar{n}_r^\text{crit} = 377$ photons for our sample's parameters. These results highlight the promising performance of the transmon molecule in the high-power regime, establishing it as a compelling platform for high-fidelity qubit readout.

Plasmonic nanostructures enable efficient light-to-energy conversion by concentrating optical energy into nanoscale volumes. A key mechanism in this process is chemical interface damping (CID), where surface plasmons are damped by adsorbed molecules, enabling the transfer of charge to adsorbed molecules. In this study, we investigate the relationship between CID and adsorbate-induced changes in DC electrical resistivity for four molecular adsorbates-adenine, 4-aminothiophenol (ATP), biphenyl thiol (BPT), and 1-dodecanethiol (DDT)-on gold surfaces. Our results reveal two distinct CID regimes. BPT causes CID via direct electronic transitions to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is centered at approx. 2 eV above the Fermi level and can be resonantly excited by the plasmon. This mechanism is dependent on plasmon energy. In contrast, ATP, adenine and DDT lead to plasmon damping through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface. This regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy since it does not involve resonant electron excitation between hybridized metal-molecule states. This same mechanism contributes to adsorbate-induced changes in DC resistivity, suggesting that resistivity measurements can serve as a probe of plasmonic energy transfer, as highlighted by the good correlation between the two effects. These findings provide new insights into the microscopic origins of plasmon damping and offer a unified framework for understanding metal-adsorbate energy transfer.

[121]. [*Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23729 "Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering")
Kazuki Doi, Tadashi Takayanagi
We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.
