The rheological behaviour of a polymer was investigated by performing numerical simulations in complex flow and comparing them to experiments. For our simulations, we employed a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics scheme, utilizing an integral fractional model based on the K-BKZ framework. The results are compared with experiments performed on melt-state isotactic polypropylene under medium and large amplitude oscillatory shear.
  The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data, and the model is able to capture and predict both the linear and the non-linear viscoelastic behaviours of the polymer melt. Results show that equipping SPH with an integral fractional model is promising approach for the simulation of complex polymeric materials under realistic conditions.

Percolation theory serves as a cornerstone for studying phase transitions and critical phenomena, with broad implications in statistical physics, materials science, and complex networks. However, most machine learning frameworks for percolation analysis have focused on two-dimensional systems, oversimplifying the spatial correlations and morphological complexity of real-world three-dimensional materials. To bridge this gap and improve label efficiency and scalability in 3D systems, we propose a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) that leverages features of the largest cluster as discriminative input. Our method achieves high predictive accuracy for both site and bond percolation thresholds and critical exponents in three dimensions, with sub-1% error margins using significantly fewer labeled samples than traditional approaches. This work establishes a robust and data-efficient framework for modeling high-dimensional critical phenomena, with potential applications in materials discovery and complex network analysis.

Darryl D. Holm, Maneesh Kumar Singh, Oliver D. Street
We introduce a stochastic perturbation of the Camassa-Holm equation such that, unlike previous formulations, energy is conserved by the stochastic flow. We compare this to a complementary approach which preserves Casimirs of the Poisson bracket. Through an energy preserving numerical implementation of the model, we study the influence of noise on the well-known 'peakon' formation behaviour of the solution. The energy conserving stochastic approach generates an ensemble of solutions which are spread around the deterministic Camassa-Holm solution, whereas the Casimir conserving alternative develops peakons which may propagate away from the deterministic solution more dramatically.

[*The fracture toughness of molybdenum at different grain sizes under and since brittle-ductile transition: computer modeling and experiment*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14273 "The fracture toughness of molybdenum at different grain sizes under and since brittle-ductile transition: computer modeling and experiment")
K. M. Borysovska, N. M. Marchenko, Yu. Koval, Yu. N. Podrezov, S. A. Firstov
The sharp growth of the fracture toughness after brittle-ductile transition happens at grain sizes approximately equal to the plastic zone size. Here we analyze the influence of the grain boundary on the evolution of the ensemble of dislocations near the crack tip using dislocation dynamics method. We show evidence that for large grain sizes, the size has little effect on the ensemble of dislocations and the fracture toughness, but when dislocations reach the grain boundary, distribution of dislocations changes, which leads to increase of the fracture toughness.

Daviti Gochitashvili, Charlsey R. Tomassetti, Elena R. Margine, Aleksey N. Kolmogorov
Hole-doping of covalent materials has long served as a blueprint for designing conventional high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors, but thermodynamic constraints severely limit the space of realizable compounds. Our {\it ab initio} results indicate that metastable Ag$_x$BC and Cu$_x$BC phases can be accessed via standard topochemical ion exchange reactions starting from Li$_x$BC precursors. Unlike all known stoichiometric layered metal borocarbides, the predicted AgBC and CuBC derivatives, comprising honeycomb layers bridged by dumbbells, are metallic rather than semiconducting. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg analysis reveals that the intrinsically hole-doped AgBC possesses a unique combination of electronic and vibrational features to exhibit two-gap superconductivity above 50 K.

Orbital effects, despite their fundamental significance and potential to engender novel physical phenomena and enable new applications, have long been underexplored compared to their spin counterparts. Recently, surging interest in the orbital degree of freedom has led to the discovery of a plethora of orbital-related effects, underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of their roles in quantum materials. Here, we report first experimental signatures of orbital magnetization in trigonal Tellurium, an elemental semiconductor with a unique helical crystal structure that serves as a natural platform for investigating orbital effects. Detailed angular dependent linear and nonlinear magnetotransport measurements, supported by theoretical Boltzmann transport analysis, reveal the coexistence of current-induced spin polarization and orbital magnetization. By disentangling the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom, this work establishes a general framework for understanding orbital magnetization in chiral crystals and beyond, paving the way for its utilization in orbitronics and spintronics.

We introduce and study a class of active matter models in which we keep track of fuel (stored energy) consumption. They are by construction, thermodynamically consistent. Using these models it is possible for us to observe and follow how active behaviour develops and also how it dissipates as the energy runs out. It is also straightforward to define, calculate and keep track of macroscopic thermodynamic quantities.

Rohan Mittal, Tom Zander, Johannes Lang, Sebastian Diehl
Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems.

Alexander D. Muratov, Vladik A. Avetisov
During our previous modeling using all-atom molecular dynamics, we have identified several foldamers whose nanoscale behavior resembles that of classic bistable machines, namely the Euler archs and Duffing oscillators. However, time limitations of the all-atom molecular dynamics prevent us from performing a full-scale investigation of long-time behavior and prompt us to develop a coarse-grained model. In this work, we summarize our recent research on developing such models using the most widely available method called Martini.

Laura Jansen, Thijs ter Rele, Marjolein Dijkstra
Interactions between charged colloidal particles are profoundly influenced by charge regulation and charge renormalization, rendering the effective potential highly sensitive to local particle density. In this work, we investigate how a dynamically evolving, density-dependent Yukawa interaction affects the stability of out-of-equilibrium colloidal structures. Motivated by a series of experiments where unexpectedly long-lived colloidal crystals have suggested the presence of like-charged attractions, we systematically explore the role of charge regulation and charge renormalization. Using Poisson-Boltzmann cell theory, we compute the effective colloidal charge and screening length as a function of packing fraction. These results are subsequently incorporated into Brownian dynamics simulations that dynamically resolve the evolving colloid charge as a function of time and local density. In the case of slow relaxation dynamics, our results show that incorporating these charging effects significantly prolongs the lifetimes of out-of-equilibrium colloidal crystals, providing an explanation for the experimental observation of long-lived crystals. These findings demonstrate that the interplay of surface charge dynamics and colloidal interactions can give rise to complex and rich nonequilibrium behavior in charged colloidal suspensions, opening new pathways for tuning colloidal stability through electrostatic feedback mechanisms.

Maxwell Wisne, Venkat Chandrasekhar
The ability to non-dissipatively tune the Josephson coupling energy of Josephson junctions is a useful tool in frequency-tunable qubits. This is typically done by threading magnetic flux through two junctions connected in a loop, a geometry that exposes the qubit to magnetic environmental noise. In this paper, we show that by biasing a junction with supercurrent from a separate pair of superconducting leads coupled to the device, the Josephson energy can be tuned without the need for a flux loop. Our multiterminal device may enable the realization of a frequency-tunable qubit with greatly reduced susceptibility to flux noise.

Natalya A Zimbovskaya
In the present work we theoretically analyze electroluminescence occurring in a biased single-molecule junction with a chiral bridge imitated by a helical chain. We show that optical transitions between electron states of the chiral linker may result in the emission of circular polarized light whose handedness depends on both direction of propagation and the polarity of the bias voltage provided that the coupling between the bridge sites is sufficiently strong. The mechanism controlling this specific light emission does not depend on the magnetic moments and spin-orbit interactions. It rather relies on the chiral properties of the bridge molecule and on the distribution of the bias voltage between the electrodes in the junction.

[13]. [*Dynamic annihilation pathways of magnetic skyrmions*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14365 "Dynamic annihilation pathways of magnetic skyrmions")
Matthew Copus, Ezio Iacocca
The investigation of magnetic solitons often relies on numerical modeling to determine key features such as stability, annihilation, nucleation, and motion. However, as soliton sizes approach atomic length scales, the accuracy of these predictions become increasingly sensitive to the details of the numerical model. Here, we study the annihilation of two-dimensional magnetic skyrmions using a pseudospectral approach and compare its performance to that of conventional micromagnetic simulations. A central distinction between the models lies in their treatment of the exchange interaction, which governs the magnon dispersion relation and plays a crucial role to balance the uniaxial anisotropy to stabilise skyrmions. We demonstrate that both the choice of model and spatial discretisation significantly influence the skyrmion dynamics and the magnetic field required for annihilation. The pseudospectral model provides a consistent description across length scales and captures complex behaviours such as skyrmion breathing on its path to annihilation. Our results have direct implications in the state-of-the-art modeling of skyrmions and other two-dimensional textures and will impact the modeling of three-dimensional textures such as hopfions.

Issam Mahraj, Andrzej Ptok
NbSi$_{2}$ crystallizes in the P6$_{2}$22 symmetry, featuring chiral chains of Si atoms. The absence of inversion symmetry, combined with its chiral structure, gives arise to unique physical properties. The breaking of inversion symmetry leads to the emergence of Weyl points, while the chiral structure enables the formation of chiral edge modes. As a result, NbSi$_{2}$ serves as an ideal platform for exploring the interplay between phonon Weyl points and chiral phonon edge modes. For example, we identify the presence of a structure consisting of three Weyl points with a Chern number of $\mathcal{C} = +1$ around the $\bar{\text{K}}$ point. These nodes form unconventional Fermi arcs connecting the $\bar{\Gamma}$ or $\bar{\text{K}}$ points, which mimic an effective Chern number of $\mathcal{C} = -2$.

Tyler D. Dole\v{z}al, Rodrigo Freitas, Ju Li
The segregation and ordering behavior of light interstitials (B, C, and N) in Cr30-Ni is examined, as these elements are critical for grain boundary stability and high-temperature mechanical performance in Ni-based superalloys. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we identify the chemical and structural preferences of these interstitials in both bulk and grain boundary (GB) environments, aligning with experimental segregation and precipitation trends. Boron strongly prefers GBs over the bulk, where it enhances GB cohesion and stabilizes the GB structure. Uniquely, boron induces a structural transformation at higher concentrations, hinting at the formation of serrated GBs where boron content is high, which improves high-temperature mechanical performance. Carbon and nitrogen form carbide and nitride motifs and exhibit limited GB solubility, reinforcing their precipitation tendencies. In support of ongoing hydrogen embrittlement mitigation strategies, we also examined hydrogen behavior. Hydrogen demonstrated chemical stability in the Cr-Ni GB zone, suggesting it may preferentially migrate inward along Cr- and Ni-rich GBs while avoiding Mo-enriched regions, further supporting Mo's role in mitigating embrittlement. These findings suggest that Mo-containing borides may serve as effective barriers against hydrogen-induced degradation by inhibiting H ingress and stabilizing GB cohesion. By elucidating the chemical and structural preferences of these light interstitials, this work provides a robust computational framework for guiding superalloy design toward improved high-temperature grain boundary stability, resistance to hydrogen embrittlement, and controlled chemical ordering.

Tyler D. Dol\v{z}al, Emre Tekoglu, Jong-Soo Bae, Gi-Dong Sim, Rodrigo Freitas, Ju Li
This study employed hybrid Monte Carlo Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate the short-range ordering behavior of Ni-based superalloys doped with boron or carbon. The simulations revealed that both boron and carbon dissociated from their host Ti atoms to achieve energetically favored ordering with Cr, Mo, and Nb. Boron clusters formed as B2, surrounded by Mo, Nb, and Cr, while carbon preferentially clustered with Cr to form a Cr23C6 local motif and with Nb to form Nb2C. Distinct preferences for interstitial sites were observed, with boron favoring tetrahedral sites and carbon occupying octahedral sites. In the presence of a vacancy, B2 shifted from the tetrahedral site to the vacancy, where it remained coordinated with Mo, Nb, and Cr. Similarly, carbon utilized vacancies to form Nb2C clusters. Excess energy calculations showed that B and C exhibited strong thermodynamic stability within their short-range ordered configurations. However, under Ti-rich conditions, C was more likely to segregate into TiC, despite preexisting ordering with Cr. This shift in stability suggests that increased Ti availability would alter carbide formation pathways, drawing C away from Cr-rich networks and promoting the development of TiC. Such redistribution may disrupt the continuity of Cr-based carbide networks, which play a critical role in stabilizing grain boundaries and impeding crack propagation. These effects further underscore the impact of interstitial-induced ordering on phase stability and microstructural evolution. This work provides an atomistic perspective on how boron- and carbon-induced ordering influences microstructure and mechanical properties. These findings highlight the critical role of interstitial-induced short-range ordering and demonstrate that this mechanism can be leveraged as a design principle to fine-tune alloy microstructures for specific engineering applications.

Water exhibits rich polymorphism, where more than 20 crystalline phases have been experimentally reported. Five of them are metastable and form at low temperatures by either heating amorphous ice or degassing clathrate hydrates. However, such metastable phases rarely crystallise directly from liquid water, making it challenging to study metastable phase relations at relatively high temperatures. Here, we report that high-pressure metastable phases of ice, including two unknown phases named ices XXI and XXII, crystallise directly from liquid water in a deeply supercooled region around the homogeneous nucleation temperature. The key is to use emulsified water to stabilise supercooled water in laboratory timescales. Ices XXI and XXII are obtained by isothermal compression of emulsified water at 295 K and 250 K, respectively. Our powder x-ray and neutron diffraction analyses combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed the surprisingly complex structures of these new phases with Z = 152 (ice XXI) and 304 (ice XXII). Ice XXI is topologically identical to 'ice T2' previously predicted by MD simulations, and our experimental structural model can be used as a benchmark for its structures in simulations, which depend on the force fields. On cooling, ice XXI transforms into an orientationally ordered counterpart named ice XXIII. Our results revealed the "hidden" structural complexity of water underlying the phase diagram, as implied by previous computational works. Further efforts at unveiling such metastable phase relations will bridge the large gaps between computational and experimental phase diagrams of water.

This study presents a comprehensive computational investigation of magnetite nanoparticles, systematically evaluating a range of force fields against experimental results. We analyze the influence of particle size, temperature, and surface-adsorbed water molecules on the structural and dynamic properties of the nanoparticles. We performed classical molecular dynamics of nanoparticles and bulk magnetite and utilized density functional theory calculations for bulk magnetite for comparison. Our results reveal that nanoparticle size and the presence of adsorbed water molecules have a pronounced impact on the density of states. Specifically, as the nanoparticle size is decreased, phonon modes exhibit significant broadening and softening, which is attributable to reduced phonon lifetimes resulting from enhanced boundary scattering. The incorporation of water further broadens the density of states and extends the spectra to higher energy regions. Temperature variations result in a slight broadening and softening of the phonon density of states, particularly in the oxygen-dominated region, which is attributed to phonon anharmonicity.

Engineering moir\'e superlattices in van der Waals heterostructures provides fundamental control over emergent electronic, structural, and optical properties allowing to affect topological and correlated phenomena. This control is achieved through imposed periodic modulation of potentials and targeted modifications of symmetries. For twisted bilayers of van der Waals materials with rectangular lattices, such as PdSe2, this work shows that one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e patterns emerge universally. This emergence is driven by a series of critical twist angles (CAs). We investigate the geometric origins of these unique 1D moir\'e patterns and develop a universal mathematical framework to predict the CAs in twisted rectangular lattices. Through a density functional theory (DFT) description of the electronic properties of twisted bilayer PdSe2, we further reveal directionally localized flat band structures, localized charge densities and strong spin-orbit coupling along the dispersive direction which points to the emergence of an effectively 1D strongly spin-orbit coupled electronic systems. This establishes twisted rectangular systems as a unique platform for engineering low-symmetry moir\'e patterns, low-dimensional strongly correlated and topological physics, and spatially selective quantum phases beyond the isotropic paradigms of hexagonal moir\'e materials.

Elucidation of the symmetry and structure of order parameter(OP) is a fundamental subject in the study of superconductors. Recently, a growing number of superconducting materials have been identified that suggest additional spontaneous symmetry breakings besides the primal breaking of U(1) gauge symmetry, including time-reversal, chiral, and rotational symmetries. Observation of collective modes in those exotic superconductors is particularly important, as they provide the fingerprints of the superconducting OP. Here we investigate the collective modes in an iron-based superconductor, FeSe, a striking example of superconductivity emergent in an electronic nematic phase where the rotational symmetry of electronic degree of freedom is spontaneously broken. By using terahertz nonlinear spectroscopy technique, we discovered a collective mode resonance located substantially below the superconducting gap energy, distinct from the amplitude Higgs mode. Comparison with theoretical calculations demonstrates that the observed mode is attributed to a collective fluctuation between the s+d-wave-like ground state and the subleading pairing channel, which corresponds to the so-called Bardasis-Schrieffer mode but also resembles an intraband Leggett mode. Our result corroborates the multicomponent pairing channels in FeSe activated in the lower space group symmetry in the electronic nematic phase.

The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent phenomenon in noncentrosymmetric systems, enables the generation of a transverse voltage without an external magnetic field through a second-order electrical response. However, achieving a sizable NLHE signal remains a critical challenge for its application in frequency-doubling and rectifying devices. Here, we report a light-induced giant enhancement of the NLHE in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the CaZrO3/KTaO3 (111) interface. Under light illumination, the second harmonic Hall voltage (V2{\omega} y) increases substantially and undergoes a sign reversal. Correspondingly,the second-order transverse conductivity increases by nearly five orders of magnitude, reaching 2.4 um V-1 omega-1, while also reversing its sign. Scaling analysis indicates that skew scattering is the dominant mechanism underlying the NLHE and is highly tunable via optical gating. Photoexcitation pumps electrons from in-gap states into the higher-lying Ta 5d conduction band, generating high-mobility photocarriers that significantly increase the cubic transport scattering time, thereby driving a dramatic enhancement of {\sigma}(2) yxx. First-principles calculations further reveal that the Berry curvature distribution on the Fermi surface strongly depends on band filling. As the Fermi level approaches a band crossing in the Ta 5d subband near the M point, the Berry curvature triple undergoes a sign change, accounting for the experimentally observed sign reversal of the nonlinear Hall response. Our work offers a new strategy to optically boost and tune the nonlinear Hall effect in oxide 2DEG systems, paving the way for applications in light-controlled rectification and nonlinear electronic devices.

Pedro Juli\'an-Salgado, Leonardo Dagdug, Denis Boyer
Brownian diffusion subject to stochastic resetting to a fixed position has been widely studied for applications to random search processes. In an unbounded domain, the mean first passage time at a target site can be minimized for a convenient choice of the resetting rate. Here we study this optimization problem in one dimension when resetting occurs to random positions, chosen from a distribution with compact support that does not include the target. Depending on the shape of this distribution, the optimal resetting rate either varies smoothly with the mean distance to the target, as in single-site resetting, or exhibits a discontinuity caused by the presence of a second local minimum in the mean first passage time. These two regimes are separated by a critical line containing a singular point that we characterize through a Ginzburg-Landau theory. To quantify how useful a given resetting position is for a search process, we calculate the distribution of the last resetting position before absorption. The discontinuous transition above separates two markedly different optimal strategies: one with a small resetting rate where the last path before absorption starts from a rather distant but likely position, while the other strategy has a large resetting rate, favoring last paths starting from not-so-likely points but which are closer to the target.

Ferrimagnetic Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ grown on the (001) surface of paramagnetic Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ experiences an exchange bias field, which has been attributed to the magnetism of an interface layer between the two materials. We report here that when grown using sputtering and with lower post-annealing temperatures than in previous works, the blocking temperature of the interface magnetic layer is lowered to about 7 K, while still displaying a strong exchange bias. This exchange bias is then found to be tunable between its two extreme values by carefully varying the field cooling protocol. This is attributed to a slow and complex dynamics of the spins of the interface-layer when it is warmed up close to its blocking (or melting) temperature, which is reminiscent of a spin glass.

Yan Gong, HuiMin Tang, Yong Yang, Yoshiyuki Kawazoe
A potential orthorhombic phase of Ta$_2$O$_5$, designated as Y-Ta$_2$O$_5$, is predicted under high-pressure conditions through density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with structural search algorithms. This phase, consisting of four formula units per unit cell ($Z = 4$), exhibits the highest known Ta-O coordination numbers. Y-Ta$_2$O$_5$ is found to be the most energetically favorable form of Ta$_2$O$_5$ in the pressure range of approximately 70 GPa to at least 200 GPa. Both standard DFT-GGA and higher-accuracy GW calculations reveal that Y-Ta$_2$O$_5$ is a wide bandgap semiconductor with a direct bandgap. Additionally, nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) introduce nontrivial corrections to external pressure at fixed volumes, underscoring their significance in high-pressure phase stability analyses.

Jinyuan Shang, Haiping Hu
Nonreciprocity breaks the symmetry between forward and backward propagation, giving rise to a range of peculiar wave phenomena. In this work, we investigate Anderson localization in higher-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices. Focusing on the two-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model, we uncover anisotropic hybrid modes (HMs) that exhibit skin localization along one direction and Anderson localization along the other. We determine the Anderson transition along different directions via the transfer matrix approach and finite-size scaling of Lyapunov exponents. This allows us to map out mobility edges that separate HMs from normal skin modes and Anderson localized modes (ALMs), revealing an ALM-HM-ALM reentrant transition. Our analysis extends to arbitrary dimensions, and we demonstrate the existence of skin-Anderson transitions on the infinite-dimensional nonreciprocal Bethe lattice using the forward-scattering approximation.

Kaile Chen, Xin Jin, Xiaolong Yang
Recent research has revealed that cubic boron arsenide (BAs) exhibits a non-monotonic pressure dependence of lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) under isotropic strain. Here, through rigorous first-principles calculations, we unveil that uniaxial tensile strain induces a monotonic reduction in the $\kappa_{\rm L}$ of BAs -- a striking contrast to the isotropic scenario. The results show that applying uniaxial (100) strain leads to the lifting of phonon band degeneracy, accompanied by an overall softening of the phonon spectrum. These modifications significantly increase phonon-phonon scattering channels by facilitating the fulfillment of selection rules, resulting in a concurrent increase in both three- and four-phonon scattering rates. Consequently, $\kappa_{\rm L}$ exhibits a dramatic suppression of nearly 80\% under large tension at room temperature. Meanwhile, we unexpectedly observe that the uniaxial strain suppresses $\kappa_{\rm L}$ much more strongly in the direction perpendicular to the strain than along the stretching direction. This work establishes the fundamental understanding of the thermal conductivity behavior of BAs under uniaxial strain and opens a promising avenue for manipulating solid-state heat transport by tuning crystal symmetry.

Aarti Lakhara, Lars Thole, Rolf J. Haug, P. A. Bhobe
We report an observation of metal-insulator transition in a thin film of SnSe$_2$. The room-temperature carrier concentration of SnSe$_2$ film was increased by electrostatic doping to 1.14$\times$ 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. A crossover from insulating phase to metallic state was clearly observed. The low-temperature charge transport mechanism is governed by two-dimensional (2D) variable-range hopping. This mechanism is influenced by band bending and gap states introduced by selenium vacancies. At low temperatures, the mobility is primarily limited by charged impurities, while at higher temperatures, it follows a power-law dependence, $\mu = T^{-\gamma}$, indicating a dominance of electron-phonon scattering. The application of a gate field shifts the Fermi level toward the conduction band, and at sufficiently high temperatures, this drives the system into a metallic state. Our findings offer insights into the charge transport mechanisms in SnSe$_2$ FET, this understanding will allow for the optimization of other 2D materials for advanced electronic device applications.

The formation of quantized vortices is a unifying feature of quantum mechanical systems, making it a premier means for fundamental and comparative studies of different quantum fluids. Being excited states of motion, vortices are normally unstable towards relaxation into lower energy states. However, here we exploit the driven-dissipative nature of polaritonic fluids of light to create stationary, multiply charged vortices. We measure the spectrum of collective excitations and observe negative energy modes at the core and positive energy modes at large radii. Their coexistence at the same frequency normally causes the dynamical instability, but here intrinsic losses stabilize the system, allowing for phase pinning by the pump on macroscopic scales. We observe common features of quantized vortices in quantum fluids and other rotating geometries like astrophysical compact objects, opening the way to the study of universal amplification phenomena.

Yang Wang, Pengjian Tan, Mingxi Chi, Boxi Wei, Anchun Ji, Jian Wang, He Wang
We investigate the anisotropic flux dynamics in 2H-NbS$_2$ single crystals through temperature-dependent resistance measurements under in-plane ($H \parallel ab$ plane) and out-of-plane ($H \perp ab$ plane) magnetic fields. Analysis of thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) resistance in the superconducting mixed state reveals stark contrasts in thermal activation energy ($U_0$) scaling and field dependence. For $H \perp ab$, $U_0(0.1 \mathrm{T}) = (1228.76 \pm 53.64)$ K follows the Arrhenius relation with a power-law field decay ($U_0\propto H^{-\alpha}$). In contrast, under $H \parallel ab$, $U_0(0.5 \mathrm{T}) = (7205.58 \pm 619.65)$ K aligns with the modified TAFF theory, where the scaling exponent $q = 2$ potentially reflects two-dimensional vortex behavior in the TAFF region, and the field dependence of $U_0$ follows parabolic relation $H^{\gamma}\left[1 - \frac{H}{H^{*}}\right]^2$. These results establish 2H-NbS$_2$ as a model system for probing the anisotropy of flux dynamics in layered superconductors.

Jasmin Imran Alsous, Brato Chakrabarti, Bryce Palmer, Michael J. Shelley
The male fruit fly produces ~1.8 mm long sperm, thousands of which can be stored until mating in a ~200 micron sac, the seminal vesicle. While the evolutionary pressures driving such extreme sperm (flagellar) lengths have long been investigated, the physical consequences of their gigantism are unstudied. Through high-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of in vivo sperm morphologies and rapid live imaging, we discovered that stored sperm are organized into a dense and highly aligned state. The packed flagella exhibit system-wide collective 'material' flows, with persistent and slow-moving topological defects; individual sperm, despite their extraordinary lengths, propagate rapidly through the flagellar material, moving in either direction along material director lines. To understand how these collective behaviors arise from the constituents' nonequilibrium dynamics, we conceptualize the motion of individual sperm as topologically confined to a reptation-like tube formed by its neighbors. Therein, sperm propagate through observed amplitude-constrained and internally driven flagellar bending waves, pushing off counter-propagating neighbors. From this conception, we derive a continuum theory that produces an extensile material stress that can sustain an aligned flagellar material. Experimental perturbations and simulations of active elastic filaments verify our theoretical predictions. Our findings suggest that active stresses in the flagellar material maintain the sperm in an unentangled, hence functional state, in both sexes, and establish giant sperm in their native habitat as a novel and physiologically relevant active matter system.

D. I. Zainutdinov, A. E. Volkov
The resistance of bulk silicon carbide (SiC) to impacts of swift heavy ions (SHI) decelerating at room temperature in the electronic stopping regime is well known. However, the effect of the SiC film thickness on the formation and structure of SHI tracks over a wide range of irradiation temperatures remains unexplored. To address this disadvantage, we utilize a model sensitive to irradiation temperature that describes all stages of ion track formation: from material excitation, considering the emission of excited electrons from the film surface (MC code TREKIS-3), to the reaction of the material's atomic system to the excitation (classical molecular dynamics). We observed the formation of two different types of nanostructures on the surface of SiC films with thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm when irradiated with 710 MeV Bi ions: craters and hills. The type of nanostructure formed depended on the irradiation temperature. The transition irradiation temperature ($T_{tr}$) from hills to craters grows with the film thickness and follows an empirical relation $T_{tr}=T_{tr}^{cr} \left(1-\left(1+\left(L/L_{cr} \right)^2 \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \right)$ with $T_{tr}^{cr}=1534$ K and $L_{cr}=2.8$ nm. That means such a transition should occur in bulk SiC at the irradiation temperature of $\approx 1534$ K.

Fangqi Cai, Mingxi Chi, Yingjie Hu, Heyao Liu, Yangyang Chen, Chao Jing, Wei Ren, He Wang
The trigonal PtBi$_2$ (t-PtBi$_2$) as a Weyl semimetal possessing triply degenerate points in its electronic bands near the Fermi level endows it with rich electronic properties. Previous studies have already measured the planar Hall effect (PHE) and in-plane anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) of t-PtBi$_2$. We noticed that their experimental results exhibited high-order features in both the PHE and AMR, yet these features were not systematically investigated. In our work, we conducted more systematic measurements and analyses of the PHE and AMR in t-PtBi$_2$. Both PHE and AMR show high-order features under low temperatures and strong magnetic fields, and these features share a similar temperature and magnetic field dependence with the turn-on behavior of resistance and temperature curves, indicating a common physical origin for them. We further summarize the critical conditions for the emergence of high-order PHE in t-PtBi$_2$, which will help to understand the origin of high-order features. In addition, we performed computational simulations on the AMR of t-PtBi$_2$, and the results were consistent with the experiments, indicating the high-order features are the result of the combined contribution of the Fermi surface anisotropy and the scaling behavior of magnetoresistance. Our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the origins of high-order features in non-magnetic topological materials.

Superfluids under specific conditions can exhibit spontaneous breaking of continuous translation symmetries and form exotic spatially ordered states of matter known as supersolids. Despite its early theoretical prediction, it took over half-a-centrury to experimentally demonstrate the supersolid phase in ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, forming due to long-range interatomic interactions. Here we propose as a promising new platform for supersolidity exciton-polariton superfluids, confined in annular optically induced traps. The supersolid phase emerges due to effective attractive interactions, mediated by the normal excitonic component of the system. Experimental demonstration of spontaneously formed spatially ordered phase is in agreement with detailed mean-field theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. The spontaneous character of the observed supersolid transition is further evidenced by the formation of specific zero-energy Nambu-Goldstone modes in the collective excitation spectrum.

Subhra Sen Gupta, Shinjini Paul, Suman Mandal, D. D. Sarma, Priya Mahadevan
We address the technologically important issue of the spin orientation on a correlated magnetic surface and how to manipulate it. We consider a prototypical strongly correlated system, NiO, and show that a single particle approach with anisotropic hoppings, or even a many-electron model with a scalar Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ fails to explain the strain driven spin reorientation transition (SRT). We set up a model treating both anisotropic single particle effects and orbital-dependent, full multipole electron-electron interaction effects at the same footing. Within this model, predictive power to explain the observed SRT is regained and the results indicate the novel possibility of using an electric field to control SRT in magnetic films grown on piezoelectric substrates.

Hong Wu, Jia-Ji Zhu, Jian Li, Xue-Min Yang, Jiang-Shan Chen, Mu Zhou
Dirac semimetals are classified into types I, II, and III based on the topological charge of their Dirac points. If a three-dimensional (3D) system can be sliced into a family of $k_z$-dependent normal and topological insulators, type I Dirac points separate a 2D normal insulator from a 2D first-order topological insulator, while type II (III) Dirac points separate a 2D normal (first-order) insulator from a 2D second-order topological insulator. To investigate the effects arising from the interplay of distinct Dirac points, one may wonder whether these Dirac points can coexist in single system. Here, we propose a scheme to induce composite Dirac semimetals in a Floquet four-band system with time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries. A general description is established to characterize Dirac semimetals in Floquet systems. The results show that Dirac semimetals hosting coexisting type I, II, and III Dirac points can be induced by delta-function or harmonic driving. Our results provide a promising new avenue for exploring novel Dirac semimetals.

Zihao Sun, Longfei Li, Chuyun Wang, Jing Wang, Huaicheng Chen, Gao Wang, Liyu Liu, Fangfu Ye, Mingcheng Yang
The identification of local pressure in active matter systems remains a subject of considerable debate. Through theoretical calculations and extensive simulations of various active systems, we demonstrate that intrinsic pressure (defined in the same way as in passive systems) is an ideal candidate for local pressure of dry active matter, while the self-propelling forces on the active particles are considered as effective external forces originating from the environment. Such a framework is universal and especially convenient for analyzing mechanics of dry active systems, and it recovers the conventional scenario of mechanical equilibrium well-known in passive systems. Thus, our work is of fundamental importance to further explore mechanics and thermodynamics of complex active systems.

Seungju Yeo, Rachel Glade, Alice Quillen, Hesam Askari
Analyses of impact provide rich insights from the evolution of granular bodies to their structural properties of the surface and subsurface layers of celestial bodies. Although chemical cohesive bonding has been observed in asteroid samples, and low-speed impact has been a subject of many studies, our understanding of the role of cohesion in these dynamics is limited, especially at small gravities such as those observed on asteroid surfaces. In this work, we use numerical discrete element method (DEM) and analytical dynamic resistive force theory (DRFT) modeling to examine the effect of cohesion on the outcome of the impact into loose granular media and explore scaling laws that predict impact behavior in the presence of cohesion under various gravitational conditions and cohesive strengths. We find that the effect of cohesion on the impact behavior becomes more significant in smaller gravitational acceleration, raising the need to scale the cohesion coefficient with gravity. We find that due to an insufficient understanding of confounding between cohesion and friction-induced quasi-static and inertial resistance, the outcomes of the DEM simulation models are incongruent with a suggested analytic model using Froude and Bond number scaling based on an additive contribution of frictional and inertial forces. Our study suggests that new dimensionless parameters and scaling are required to accurately capture the role of cohesion, given its ties to frictional behavior between the grain particles at different gravities.

Dingyanyan Zhou, Yujin Ji, Mir F. Mousavi, Youyong Li
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates as photocatalytic materials due to their large surface areas and tunable electronic properties. In this work, we systematically design and screen a series of octuple-atomic-layer M$_2$A$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers (M = Al, Ga, In; A = Si, Ge, Sn; Z = N, P, As) using first-principles calculations. 108 structures are constructed by intercalation approach, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of their thermodynamic and dynamic stability, band gaps, and band edge alignments to assess their potential for photocatalytic overall water splitting. Among them, eight candidates meet the criteria for overall water splitting under acidic condition (pH = 0), and Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$, further exhibit suitable band edge positions for photocatalysis under both acidic and neutral environments (pH = 0 and 7). Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ also show pronounced visible-light absorption and structural stability in aqueous conditions. Importantly, the introduction of N vacancies on the surfaces of Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ significantly enhances their catalytic activity for both hydrogen reduction and water oxidation reactions, further supporting their potential as photocatalysts for overall water splitting. Our study provides theoretical insights for the rational design of efficient and stable 2D photocatalysts for overall water splitting.

[39]. [*Reconciling Translational Invariance and Hierarchy*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14656 "Reconciling Translational Invariance and Hierarchy")
Olai B. Mykland, Zhao Zhang
Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they describe exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents.

Sougata Biswas, Debika Debnath, Paramita Dutta
Recent discovery of the superconducting ground state in Quasicrystals (QCs) has opened up an exciting new avenue for superconductivity based on QCs. However, theoretical studies to date have largely focused on a limited subset of quasiperiodic structures. In this work, we broaden the scope by theoretically investigating the behavior of the superconducting order parameter (OP) across a wide class of aperiodic systems, including both generalized Fibonacci and non-Fibonacci QCs based on the attractive Hubbard model. We begin with a one-dimensional toy model, and for the generality of our findings, we extend our analysis to two-dimensional QCs. Remarkably, despite the increased dimensionality, the qualitative features of the OP remain largely preserved. By systematically analyzing models generated through various growth rules, we elucidate the influence of quasiperiodicity on the OP amplitudes. We study the evolution of the OP with respect to the temperature, strength of the interaction, and nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude. Our numerical analysis identifies the most favorable QC structure and parameter regime that supports enhanced onsite pairing amplitudes. Additionally, we provide a comparative analysis of the superconducting transition temperatures across the range of quasiperiodic configurations. To gain further insight into these systems, we compute key thermodynamic quantities: the entropy and electronic specific heat, and examine their dependence on the underlying structural sequences. This analysis enables us to determine which QC structures are most conducive to Cooper pair formation.

San\'e Erasmus, Charalampos Skokos, George Kalosakas
Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.

Altermagnets are a novel type of magnetic system that has a spin-polarised electric band structure in the absence of a net magnetic moment, leading to exciting prospects in potential device applications. Hexagonal MnTe, a prototypical altermagnet, has arguably shown the most properties consistent with theoretical predictions, including an anomalous Hall effect despite no net magnetisation, and strong altermagnet-induced spin splitting in the electronic band structure. Here we present muon-spin spectroscopy measurements of a single crystal of MnTe. Below room temperature we observe pronounced anomalies in the muon-spin depolarisation, as well as the onset of a second, non-proportional internal field in the absence of an applied field. These findings point to a change in the magnetic structure around $T\simeq250$ K, which coincides with other changes in reported properties, such as transport.

Vic Vander Linden, Boris De Vos, Kevin Vervoort, Frank Verstraete, Atsushi Ueda
The quantum $5$-state Potts model is known to possess a perturbative description using complex conformal field theory (CCFT), the analytic continuation of ``theory space" to a complex plane. To study the corresponding complex fixed point on the lattice, the model must be deformed by an additional non-Hermitian term due to its complex coefficient $\lambda$. Although the variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings. Moreover, we reconstruct the full boundary CCFT spectrum through the entanglement Hamiltonian encoded in the ground state. Our work demonstrates how tensor networks are the correct approach to capturing the approximate conformal invariance of weakly first-order phase transitions.

Nils Bruch, Michael Eikerling, Tobias Binninger
The electric double layer (EDL) that forms at the interface between metals and ionic solutions is at the heart of various energy technologies. Recent experimental data have challenged our traditional understanding of the EDL charging behavior, which is based on mean-field Gouy-Chapman-Stern-type (GCS) models. In this article, we present a classical theory for the EDL, derived from first-principles statistical mechanics, that accounts for electron-ion correlation effects using the method of image charges and systematically extends beyond the mean-field level. Such electron-ion correlations introduce an additional interaction between the metal surface and electrolyte ions, significantly altering the EDL structure. Our theory, valid in the limit of dilute electrolyte solutions and weakly charged metal surfaces, achieves quantitative agreement with experimental capacitance data across a wide range of electrode materials and electrolyte solvents, and thus resolves long-standing questions on the origin of discrepancies to GCS predictions. Thereby, the framework conceptually unifies the processes of double-layer charging and ion adsorption (electrosorption), which are typically considered as distinct phenomena, but are shown to be manifestations of the same fundamental electrostatic principles.

Daigo Oue, M\'ario G. Silveirinha
Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall current. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.

J. Boy, R. Mitdank, A. Popp, Z. Galazka, S. F. Fischer
Phonon drag may be harnessed for thermoelectric generators and devices. Here, we demonstrate the geometric control of the phonon-drag contribution to the thermopower. In nanometer-thin electrically conducting $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films homoepitaxially-grown on insulating substrates it is enhanced from -0,4 mV/K to up to -3 mV/K at 100 K by choice of the film thickness. Analysis of the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficients reveal that a crossover from three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional electron-phonon interaction occurs for film thicknesses below 75~nm. The ratio of phonon-phonon to electron-phonon relaxation times in these confined structures is $10$ times larger than that of bulk. Generally the phonon drag can be tuned depending on the relations between the phonon-drag interaction length $\lambda_\text{PD}$, the phonon mean free path $\lambda$ and the film thickness $d$. Phonon drag can be enhanced for $\lambda_\text{PD}\gg\lambda>d$.

Dimitris Iordanidis, Fernanda F. Fontenele, Konstantinos Poulios, Michalis Agoras, Nikolaos Bouklas
The main objective of this work is to numerically investigate the effect of geometric imperfections on the macroscopic response and domain formation in soft biological composites that exhibit plasticity in the stiff (fiber) phase.This work builds on the corresponding bifurcation analysis in Part I of this study for simple laminates with perfectly flat layers under plane strain, nonmonotonic loading conditions, aligned with the layer direction. The post-bifurcation solution obtained in Part I for these materials corresponds physically to the formation of twin lamellar domains perpendicular to the loading axis, which is consistent with the chevron like deformation patterns that develop in tendons under cyclic loading. As biological materials are highly imperfect, and specifically tendons exhibit a high degree of so called crimp in the collagen fibers, in this study the effect of imperfections to the response is explored. For all composites with small initial imperfections that have been considered, the results of this work have been found to be in complete agreement with the corresponding analytical results of Part I, and, domains have been found to emerge at a macroscopically compressive state. However, as the imperfection amplitude is increased and becomes of the order to the layer width, or greater, domains begin to develop at macroscopically tensile stresses, which is in agreement with the fact that the loading of soft biological materials such as tendons and ligaments is tensile in nature. Thus, the findings of this work suggest strongly that plasticity and geometric imperfections of collagen fibers may play a key role on the onset and evolution of domains in actual soft biological composites.

Yuta Nozaki, Darian Hall, Ivan I. Smalyukh, Yuya Koda
The Hopf index, a topological invariant that quantifies the linking of preimage fibers, is fundamental to the structure and stability of hopfions. In this work, we propose a new mathematical framework for modeling hopfions with high Hopf index, drawing on the language of singularity theory and the topology of differentiable maps. At the core of our approach is the notion of a generalized Hopf map of order $n$, whose structure is captured via fold maps and their Stein factorizations. We demonstrate that this theoretical construction not only aligns closely with recent experimental observations of high-Hopf-index hopfions, but also offers a precise classification of the possible configurations of fiber pairs associated to distinct points. Our results thus establish a robust bridge between the geometry of singular maps and the experimentally observed topology of complex field configurations of hopfions in materials and other physical systems.

Geometric frustration is a widespread phenomenon in physics, materials science, and biology, occurring when the geometry of a system prevents local interactions from being all accommodated. The resulting manifold of nearly degenerate configurations can lead to complex collective behaviors and emergent pseudosymmetry in diverse systems such as frustrated magnets, mechanical metamaterials, and protein assemblies. In synthetic multi-twinned nanomaterials, similar pseudosymmetric features have also been observed and manifest as intrinsic lattice strain. Despite extensive interest in the stability of these nanostructures, a fundamental understanding remains limited due to the lack of detailed structural characterization across varying sizes and geometries. In this work, we apply four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy strain mapping over a total of 23 decahedral nanoparticles with edge lengths, d, between 20 and 55 nm. From maps of full 2D strain tensor at nanometer spatial resolution, we reveal the prevalence of heterogeneity in different modes of lattice distortions, which homogenizes and restores symmetry with increasing size. Knowing the particle crystallography, we reveal distinctive spatial patterns of local lattice phase transformation between face-centered cubic and body-centered tetragonal symmetries, with a contrast between particles below and above d of 35 nm. The results suggest a cross-over size of the internal structure occurs, as particles shape transition from modified-Wulff shape favored at nanoscale to faceted, pentagonal bipyramidal shape. Ultimately, our 4D-STEM mapping provides new insight to long-standing mysteries of this historic system and can be widely applicable to study nanocrystalline solids and material phase transformation that are important in catalysis, metallurgy, electronic devices, and energy storage materials.

Terahertz spintronic devices combine ultrafast operation with low power consumption, making them strong candidates for next-generation memory technologies. In this study, we use time-domain terahertz emission spectroscopy to investigate spin-to-charge conversion (SCC) in bilayer heterostructures comprising topological insulators (TIs) or Weyl semimetals (WSMs) with ferromagnetic metals (FMs). SCC is studied in TI materials \ce{Bi2Se3}, Pb-doped \ce{Bi2Se3}, and (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$, and the WSM NbP. Our results reveal that the dependence of SCC on TI thickness varies with interface quality, indicating that thickness dependence alone is not a reliable criterion for distinguishing between inverse spin Hall effect and the inverse Rashba--Edelstein effect mechanisms. We find efficient SCC in TIs depends on both \textit{in-situ} growth to prevent surface oxidation and proper composition. In NbP$\vert$FM bilayers, we observe THz emission with efficiency and bandwidth comparable to that of TIs, highlighting the broader potential of topological materials. Finally, broadband spectral measurements demonstrate that both TIs and WSMs can generate THz pulses with frequencies extending up to 8\,THz. These findings underscore the promise of topological materials as efficient platforms for ultrafast, broadband spintronic applications.

We introduce a minimal model consisting of a two-body system with stochastically broken reciprocity (i.e., random violation of Newton's third law) and then investigate its statistical behaviors, including correlation functions, time evolution of probability distribution functions, energy gain, and entropy production. The effective temperature of this two-body system immersed in a thermal bath is derived. Furthermore, we heuristically present an extremely minimal model where the relative motion adheres to the same rules as in classical mechanics, while the effect of stochastically broken reciprocity only manifests in the fluctuating motion of the center of mass.

The interference patterns of ultracold atoms, observed after ballistic expansion from optical lattices, encode essential information about strongly correlated lattice systems, including phase coherence and non-local correlations. While the interference of lattice bosons has been extensively investigated, quantitative studies of the lattice fermion interference remain challenging. Here, we report the observation and quantitative characterization of interference patterns in low-temperature, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases. We develop a novel method to extract first-order correlations from interference patterns, which directly reflect the short-range phase coherence of lattice fermions. Mapping the nearest-neighbor correlations as a function of lattice filling and interaction strength, we observe a crossover from a metal to a Mott insulator. Moreover, at half filling, the measured correlations agree well with quantum Monte Carlo calculations and remain finite in the regime of strong repulsion, revealing virtual tunneling processes driven by quantum fluctuations.

NiPS3 is an exfoliable van-der-Waals intralayer antiferromagnet with zigzag-type spin arrangement. It is distinct from other TMPS3 (TM: transition metal) materials by optical excitations into a strongly correlated state that is tied to the magnetic properties. However, the related, fundamental band structure across the antiferromagnetic phase transition has not been probed yet. Here, we use angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with {\mu}m resolution in combination with DFT+U calculations for that purpose. We identify a characteristic band shift across TN. It is attributed to bands of mixed Ni and S character related to the superexchange interaction of Ni 3t2g orbitals. Moreover, we find a structure above the valence band maximum with little angular dispersion that could not be reproduced by the calculations. The discrepancy suggests the influence of many-body interactions beyond the DFT+U approximations in striking contrast to the results on MnPS3 and FePS3, where these calculations were sufficient for an adequate description.

Shubham Agarwal, Martin H. M\"user
The Frenkel-Kontorova model is a simple yet generic framework for the description of tribological phenomena and processes, including dry solid friction and the motion of adsorbed layers. As revealed in this work, it also reproduces qualitatively various features of complex liquids, such as, power-law sub-diffusion between the ballistic and the diffusive regimes as well as a cross-over from a non-Arrhenius to an Arrhenius dependence of the diffusion coefficient near the temperature, where the specific heat assumes its maximum. The study of these and related thermal and kinetic properties highlights several misconceptions prevalent in the literature. Most notably, shear thinning with a shear-thinning exponent close to zero can be the natural consequence from enforced basin hopping: the energy drops caused by shear-induced instabilities dictate the friction-velocity dependence at medium shear rates rather than the way how shear forces reduce the free energy barriers for directed motion. Thus, even if the rheology is described by semi-empirical theories such as the Eyring model, any agreement with experimental data, whether past, present, or future, may be purely coincidental.

Chaimae Chrirou, Abderrahim El Allati, Robert S Whitney
Quantum thermodynamics defines the ideal quantum thermoelectric, with maximum possible efficiency at finite power output. However, such an ideal thermoelectric is challenging to implement experimentally. Instead, here we consider two types of thermoelectrics regularly implemented in experiments: (i) finite-height potential barriers or quantum point contacts, and (ii) double-barrier structures or single-level quantum dots. We model them with Landauer scattering theory as (i) step transmissions and (ii) Lorentzian transmissions. We optimize their thermodynamic efficiency for any given power output, when they are used as thermoelectric heat-engines or refrigerators. The Lorentzian's efficiency is excellent at vanishing power, but we find that it is poor at the finite powers of practical interest. In contrast, the step transmission is remarkably close to ideal efficiency (typically within 15%) at all power outputs. The step transmission is also close to ideal in the presence of phonons and other heat-leaks, for which the Lorentzian performs very poorly. Thus, a simple nanoscale thermoelectric - made with a potential barrier or quantum point contact - is almost as efficient as an ideal thermoelectric.

Chong-Sun Chu, Alfian Gunawan
We consider quantum mechanics in spacetime with time anisotropy. Such Lifshitz quantum mechanics is characterized by a kinetic term with fractional derivatives. We show that, contrary to popular belief, local conservation of probability is respected when the probability current is properly identified. As an application we consider a Josephson Junction with an anisotropic insulating layer. We show that anisotropy affects the tunneling rate and can greatly enhance the working of Josephson Junction.

Saumen Acharjee
We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of gas sensing in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) based field-effect transistors (FET) using the non-equilibrium Green function formalism and Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker approach. Moving beyond conventional density functional theory analyses, our framework captures the full device level response by incorporating field-dependent quantum transport and temperature effects. We model the impact of NO, H$_2$S, HF and CO$_2$ gases on the band structure and density of states (DOS), carrier concentration, quantum capacitance and I-V characteristics. The results indicate that CO$_2$ followed by NO induce strongest perturbations via mid-gap states and band edge shifts, leading to the appearance of asymmetric Van-Hove singularities with enhanced carrier modulation and quantum capacitance. It is observed that HF induce moderate perturbation while H$_2$S induce weakest response for all temperature and biasing condition. It is found that an applied vertical electric field narrows the band gap via the Stark effect, further boosting mobility and tunability. Temperature influences sensing response by enhancing charge transfer at moderate levels and causing desorption at higher temperatures. We found that CO$_2$ consistently show the highest sensitivity and selectivity followed by NO and HF, while H$_2$S display the weakest response. This study offers a comprehensive framework to engineer h-BN based FET sensors by harnessing intrinsic band modulation and quantum capacitance for molecule discrimination and temperature optimization.

Carson Rivard, Albrecht Jander, Pallavi Dhagat
Parametric amplification offers a route to overcoming intrinsic damping in spin-wave systems, a key challenge in the development of magnonic signal processing and computing technologies. Here we demonstrate the sustained amplification of coherent forward volume magnetostatic spin waves in a yttrium-iron-garnet thin film using a traveling surface acoustic wave as a nonstationary pump. A gain of up to 6 dB is achieved under continuous pumping below the threshold for parametric instability. The interaction generates an idler wave at a distinct frequency, consistent with three-wave mixing governed by energy and momentum conservation. This approach enables stable, frequency- and wavevector-selective spin-wave gain using practical pump power levels, establishing acoustic wave pumping as a viable mechanism for realizing active components in integrated magnonic circuits.

Zihao Sun, Longfei Li, Fangfu Ye, Mingcheng Yang
Interfacial phenomena of motility-induced phase separation of active particles challenge our conventional understanding of phase coexistence. Despite the ubiquity of nonmechanical communication couplings among real active particles, most works on active interface have concentrated on active Brownian systems with steric interparticle interactions. Here, we study the interfacial behavior of phase-separated active particles interacting solely via quorum-sensing communications using both theory and simulations. Strikingly, we find that the quorum-sensing active system exhibits vanishing mechanical surface tension but nonzero effective capillary surface tension. We further demonstrate that the mechanical equilibrium of the tensionless interface is sustained by polarization force at the interface; while its dynamics is governed by the surface stiffness, which arises from tangential particle flux induced by local interfacial deformation. Our work reveals the fundamental distinction between mechanical and capillary surface tensions in active matter and paves the way for future exploration of active interface phenomena.

Joshua Reed, S\'eforah Carolina Marques Silva, Philipp Gutfreund, Joachim Venzmer, Tatiana Gambaryan-Roisman, Emanuel Schneck
Certain trisiloxane surfactants have the remarkable property of being able to superspread: Small volumes of water rapidly wet large areas of hydrophobic surfaces. The molecular properties of the surfactants which govern this technologically relevant effect are still under debate. To gain a deeper understanding, the surfactant behaviour during the spreading process needs to be studied at molecular length scales. Here, we present neutron reflectivity analyses of two trisiloxane surfactants of similar chemical structure, of which only one exhibits superspreading properties. We present an approach to determining the composition of the adsorbed surfactant layer in spread surfactant films at the solid-liquid interface, accounting for contributions from attenuated back-reflections of the neutron beam in films with thicknesses in the range of several tens to hundreds of micrometers. Differences between superspreading and non-superspreading surfactants with regard to their volume fraction profiles at the solid/liquid interface obtained in the self-consistent analysis of the reflectivity curves are in agreement with a simple explanation of the difference in spreading behaviour based on thermodynamics.

Suman Mahakal, Pallabi Sardar, Diptasikha Das, Subrata Jana, Swapnava Mukherjee, Biplab Ghosh, Shamima Hussain, Santanu K. Maiti, Kartick Malik
We report a significant enhancement (~269%) in the power factor (PF) and a local structural transition in Ni-doped TiCoSb samples (TiCo_{1-x}Ni_xSb, (x= 0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06). First-principles calculations reveal that even minute Ni doping induces a substantial shift in the Fermi level (EF) and alters the density of states (DOS). Structural analysis via Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data shows anomalous behavior at x = 0.02, supported by Williamson-Hall and modified methods. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ti and Co K-edges further confirms a pronounced local structural change at this composition. These structural transitions are consistent with temperature-dependent resistivity (\rho(T)) and thermopower (S(T)) data, which reflect changes in EF and disorder. Analysis of Lorentz number and scattering parameters reinforces the observed modifications in the electronic structure. The simultaneous enhancement of S and electrical conductivity at x = 0.02 is attributed to the disorder-to-order transition, leading to the marked rise in PF.

V. R. Shaginyan, A. Z. Msezane, S. A. Artamonov
The physics of high-$T_c$ superconductors, which has been a major topic in condensed matter physics for more than thirty years, reveals some features of conventional superconductors. We analyze the scaling of the condensation energy $E_{\Delta}$ divided by $\gamma$, $E_{\Delta}/\gamma\simeq N(0)\Delta_1^2/\gamma$, that equally applicable to both conventional and unconventional high-$T_c$ superconductors. Here $N(0)$ is the density of states, $\Delta_1$ is the maximum value of the superconducting gap and $\gamma$ is the Sommerfeld coefficient. Basing on this observation, we analyze experimental facts that reveal the general scaling properties of both high-$T_c$ and ordinary superconductors, and theoretically explain that the Homes' law $\rho_{s0}= (1/2\pi\lambda_D)^2= T_c\sigma(T_c)$ is applicable to the both types of superconductors. Here $\rho_{s0}$ is the superconducting electron density, $\lambda_D$ is the zero-$T$ penetration depth, $\sigma$ is the normal state conductivity, $T$ is temperature and $T_c$ is the temperature of superconduction phase transition. For the first time, we also explain the reason of violation of the Homes' law. Our theoretical results agree well with experimental facts.

Antonin Brossollet, Giulio Biroli
Entropy production quantifies the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in non-equilibrium systems. Here, we develop a direct method to obtain closed, tractable expressions for entropy production in a broad class of dynamical density functional theories, from Dean's exact stochastic equation for microscopic densities to coarse-grained fluctuating-hydrodynamics models with density-dependent mobility. The method employs an Onsager-Machlup path-integral formulation. Our results reproduce particle-level calculations and matches recent Doi-Peliti treatments, confirming that the irregular noise structure of Dean's equation poses no obstacle when handled consistently. We further extend the framework to active mixtures with non-reciprocal interactions and to run-and-tumble or active-Brownian suspensions, generalizations that require a careful treatment of the spurious-drift. Our method furnishes a practical route to quantify irreversibility in density functional field theories and paves the way for systematic studies of entropy production in multi-field active fluids that couple density, momentum and orientation.

Leiming Chen, Chiu Fan Lee, John Toner
Dry active matter in an anisotropic medium is of experimental relevance, and the interplay between anisotropy and the dynamics of the active matter remains under-explored. Here, we derive the hydrodynamic equations of a generic dry polar active fluid that preferentially flows along a particular axis induced by the anisotropy of the medium. We then study its critical behavior at the order-disorder transition in which the symmetry between ``forward" and ``back" along the special axis is spontaneously broken. We obtain the critical static and dynamic exponents, mean velocity, and two point correlation functions exactly in three dimensions, and to two-loop level in two dimensions, by mapping our class of systems to the equilibrium Ising model with dipolar interactions.

In light of recent improvements in the theory of rare earth magnets, as well as the availability of improved neutron powder diffraction data on these materials, we revisit the magnetic single-ion properties of SmCo$_5$ and the magnetic structures of YCo$_5$ and NdCo$_5$. From neutron diffraction patterns in a wide range of temperatures between 3 K and 800 K, we obtain the thermal coefficient expansion and the magnetic moment values for the latter two materials. For SmCo$_5$, we fit existing neutron spectroscopy data with a model recently used for NdCo$_5$ to obtain the crystal field parameters, which are essential to determine the low-lying energy scales that set the Hamiltonian. Our results may trigger new experimental and theoretical studies towards a new route for the realization of permanent magnets.

Deep Patel
Heusler alloys were discovered in 1903, and materials with half-metallic characteristics have drawn more attention from researchers since the advances in semiconductor industry. Heusler alloys have found application as spin-filters, tunnel junctions or giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices in technological applications. In this work, the electronic structures, phonon dispersion, thermal properties, and electrical conductivities of PdMnSn and six novel alloys (AuCrSn, AuMnGe, Au2MnSn, Cu2NiGe, Pd2NiGe and Pt2CoSn) along with their magnetic moments are studied using ab initio calculations to understand the roots of half-metallicity in these alloys of Heusler family. From the phonon dispersion, the thermodynamic stability of the alloys in their respective phases is assessed. Phonon modes were also used to further understand the electrical transport in the crystals of these seven alloys. This study evaluates the relationship between materials' electrical conductivity and minority-spin bandgap in the band structure, and it provides suggestions for selecting constituent elements when designing new half-metallic Heusler alloys of C1b and L21 structures.

Wei Nong, Ruiming Zhu, Zekun Ren, Martin Hoffmann Petersen, Shuya Yamazaki, Nikita Kazeev, Andrey Ustyuzhanin, Gang Wu, Shuo-Wang Yang, Kedar Hippalgaonkar
Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating materials simulations with near-density functional theory (DFT) accuracy. However, despite significant advances, we identify a critical yet overlooked issue undermining their reliability: a systematic energy underprediction. This problem becomes starkly evident in large-scale thermodynamic stability assessments. By performing over 12 million calculations using nine MLIAPs for over 150,000 inorganic crystals in the Materials Project, we demonstrate that most frontier models consistently underpredict energy above hull (Ehull), a key metric for thermodynamic stability, total energy, and formation energy, despite the fact that over 90\% of test structures (DFT-relaxed) are in the training data. The mean absolute errors (MAE) for Ehull exceed ~30 meV/atom even by the best model, directly challenging claims of achieving ``DFT accuracy'' for property predictions central to materials discovery, especially related to (meta-)stability. Crucially, we trace this underprediction to insufficient handling of symmetry degrees of freedom (DOF), constituting both lattice symmetry and Wyckoff site symmetries for the space group. MLIAPs exhibit pronounced errors (MAE for Ehull $>$ ~40 meV/atom) in structures with high symmetry DOF, where subtle atomic displacements significantly impact energy landscapes. Further analysis also indicates that the MLIAPs show severe energy underprediction for a large proportion of near-hull materials. We argue for improvements on symmetry-aware models such as explicit DOF encoding or symmetry-regularized loss functions, and more robust MLIAPs for predicting crystal properties where the preservation and breaking of symmetry are pivotal.

Ali Kefayati, Branislav Nikolic, Yafei Ren
The magnetization dynamics driven by the femtosecond laser pulse of antiferromagnet van der Waals semiconductor CrSBr is studied within time-dependent density functional theory. We investigate the effect of laser fluence as well as the excitation frequency on the ultrafast dynamics of spins. In low fluence, the local magnetic moment of Cr increases when the laser frequency is below the band gap, whereas it decreases when the laser frequency is below the band gap. In high fluence, we find strong demagnetization independent of excitation frequency. We find that the ultrafast demagnetization in CrSBr is dominated by intralayer and interlayer optical intersite spin transfer, and spin flip via the spin-orbit coupling plays a minor role. Our results reveal hole excitation in the low-fluence regime and electron excitation in the high-fluence regime. Further, we investigate the effect of the external static magnetic field on the dynamics. We demonstrate even and odd high harmonic generation in the local magnetic moments and electric current, respectively. The external magnetic field results in an out-of-plane charge current via the inverse spin Hall effect as well as odd harmonics in the local magnetic moment dynamics as a result of breaking the time-reversal symmetry.

Siwei Zhang, Weijun Yuan, Niccol\`o Bigagli, Haneul Kwak, Tijs Karman, Ian Stevenson, Sebastian Will
Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.

Fengxian Ma, Zeying Zhang, Zhen Gao, Xiaobei Wan, Yandong Ma, Yalong Jiao, Shengyuan A. Yang
Superatoms, stable atomic clusters acting as building blocks for new materials, offer unique opportunities due to their rich properties and potential for 2D material assembly. While extensive research has focused on their similarities to ordinary atoms, the role of their internal degrees of freedom (IDOF) remains largely unexplored. Concurrently, compensated antiferromagnets (AFMs) with intrinsic spin-split band structures have emerged as a promising class of materials for spintronics, yet their experimental realization, particularly in two dimensions, is limited. Here, we bridge these two fields by proposing a novel strategy to achieve spin-split AFMs using superatoms with IDOFs. We establish our core concept using a simple model, demonstrating how superatom IDOFs can be leveraged to engineer system symmetry and induce spin splitting in AFM states. We concretely illustrate this strategy by first-principles calculations on a Mo-decorated carborophene sheets, constructed from closo-carborane superatoms. We show that the distinct IDOFs of carborane isomers (electric-dipole-like and nematic) are critical in determining the symmetry of the resulting 2D superatomic crystal and, consequently, the spin splitting pattern of its AFM states. Our findings underscore the profound significance of superatom IDOFs-a feature absent in ordinary atoms-and introduce a new paradigm for engineering spin splitting in AFM lattices. This work opens novel avenues for the design of advanced spintronic and quantum materials based on superatoms.

Masamichi Ishihara
We studied the thermodynamic quantities and the probability distribution, expressing the probability distribution as a function of the energy, in the canonical ensemble within the framework of the Tsallis statistics, which is characterized by the entropic parameter $q$, with the conventional expectation value. We treat the power-law-like distribution. The equilibrium temperature, which is often called the physical temperature, is employed to describe the probability distribution. The Tsallis statistics represented by the equilibrium temperature was applied to $N$ harmonic oscillators, where $N$ is the number of the oscillators. The expressions of the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity were obtained. The expressions of these quantities and the expression of the probability distribution were obtained when the differences between adjacent energy levels are the same. These quantities and the distributions were numerically calculated. The $q$ dependences of the energy, the R\'enyi entropy, and the heat capacity are weak. In contrast, the Tsallis entropy depends on $q$. The probability distribution as a function of the energy depends on $N$ and $q$.

Shixiang Chen, Hongguang Liang, Juan Wang, Yan Li
We investigate the spin Faraday pattern formation in a periodically driven, pancake-shaped spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) prepared with stripe phase. By modulating atomic interactions using $in$-$phase$ and $out$-$of$-$phase$ protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation frequency, $out$-$of$-$phase$ modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern, whereas $in$-$phase$ modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also excites higher-order modes (L $\ge $ 6). Unlike conventional binary BECs, Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating quantum fluid dynamics. This work establishes a platform for exploring supersolidity and nonlinear excitations in SOC systems with stripe phase.

Ruijie Xu, Sergei Nechaev
We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional model of a fluctuating interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is described by the $N$-step directed 1D random walk on a discrete half-line $m \ge 0$, and the interaction with the wall is modeled by a quenched site-dependent short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j=1,...,N$) located at $m=0$, with distribution $Q(u_j)$. By computing the first two moments, $\la G_N \ra$ and $\la G_N^2 \ra$, of the partition function $G_N$ averaged over the disorder, we show that the pinning transition for $\la G_N^2 \ra$ may or may not coincide with that of $\la G_N \ra$, depending on the details of the disorder distribution $Q(u_j)$. This result reconciles opposite viewpoints on whether the pinning transition points in models with annealed and quenched disorder coincide or not.

Xuejun Gong, Andrea Dal Corso
We present a systematic ab initio study of the thermoelastic properties of hcp osmium as functions of temperature and pressure within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). The precision of the Zero Static Internal Stress Approximation (ZSISA) and of the volume-constrained ZSISA (V-ZSISA) are rigorously assessed. For osmium, we find negligible deviations between ZSISA and a full free energy minimization (FFEM) approach. Also, the V-ZSISA approximation influences the results very little, as we found already in beryllium, despite the markedly different behavior of the c/a ratio with temperature in the two metals. Our QHA-derived ECs show excellent agreement with available experimental data in the temperature range of 5-301 K, outperforming the results obtained from the quasi-static approximation (QSA). Additionally, we report the pressure-dependent QHA ECs at 5 K, 301 K, and 1000 K, spanning pressures from 0 to 150 kbar.

Birte Beier, Erik Walendy, Jan Arneth, Eva Br\"ucher, Reinhard K. Kremer, R\"udiger Klingeler
We report a detailed high-field/high-frequency ferromagnetic resonance (HF-FMR) study of low-energy magnon excitations in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. At 2 K, the field dependence of the magnon branches is well described by a semiclassical domain-based model, from which we extract key microscopic parameters including the anisotropy gap $\Delta = 170\pm 4$ GHz, the anisotropy field $B_{\rm A} = 5.85\pm 0.08$ T, and the effective $g$-factor $g_{\rm ab}\simeq g_{\rm c} = 2.07(4)$. Furthermore the uniaxial anisotropy constant was determined to be $K = (10.5\pm 0.23) \times 10^{-6}$ erg/cm$^3$. Anisotropic short-range magnetic order persists above $T_{\rm C}$ up to approximately 270 K, as evidenced by a finite anisotropy gap and anisotropic shifts in the FMR resonance fields. Both results clearly show the presence of anisotropic local magnetic fields well above $T_{\rm C}$. Our findings underscore the crucial role of magneto-crystalline anisotropy in driving long-range magnetic order in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$.

Rapidly developing science and technology demand new materials with versatile and promising properties for practical applications. In this context, pseudo-octahedral iron(II) spin crossover (SCO) complexes are particularly appealing - not only for their fundamental scientific interest but also for their potential as key components in the development of multifunctional switchable molecular materials and novel technological applications. This work presents the synthesis and structure of a new mononuclear SCO complex [FeII(L)2]0*nMeOH (n = 2, 0) where L is the asymmetrically substituted tridentate ligand [4-trifluoromethylphenyl-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-6-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine]. Due to high trigonal distortion, the solvated form (n = 2) remains high spin (HS) at all temperatures. In contrast, the more regular Oh geometry of the unsolvated form, 4CF3, favors a complete spin transition (ST) at room temperature, which has been investigated, in the pressure interval 0-0.64 GPa, by means of its magnetic and optical properties. Contrary to intuition and experience, the increase of pressure on 4CF3 denotes a radically abnormal behavior of this ST, involving: i) decrease of the characteristic temperatures, ii) increase of the high-spin molar fraction in the temperature range where the low-spin state is stable at ambient pressure; iii) increase of the thermal hysteresis width; and iv) above certain threshold pressure, full stabilization of the high-spin state. All these observations have been explained in the framework of a thermodynamic that model based on the elastic interactions.

Nano-acoustic strain generation in thin metallic films via ultrafast laser excitation is widely used in material science, imaging and medical applications. Recently, it was shown that transition metals, such as Titanium, exhibit enhanced photoacoustic transduction properties compared to noble metals, such as Silver. This work presents experimental results and simulations that demonstrate that among transition metals Tantalum exhibits superior photoacoustic properties. Experiments of nano-acoustic strain generation by femtosecond laser pulses focused on thin Tantalum films deposited on Silicon substrates are presented. The nano-acoustic strains are measured via pump-probe transient reflectivity that captures the Brillouin oscillations produced by photon-phonon interactions. The observed Brillouin oscillations are correlated to the photoacoustic transduction efficiency of the Tantalum thin film and compared to the performance of Titanium thin films, clearly demonstrating the superior photoacoustic transduction efficiency of Tantalum. The findings are supported by computational results on the laser-induced strains and their propagation in these thin metal film/substrate systems using a Two-Temperature Model in combination with thermo-mechanical Finite Element Analysis. Finally, the role of the metal transducer-substrate acoustic impedance matching is discussed and the possibility to generate appropriately modulated acoustic pulse trains inside the crystalline substrate structures for the development of crystalline undulators used for {\gamma}-ray generation is presented.

Simphony is an open-source software package designed for the topological analysis of lattice vibrations based on Wannier tight-binding models. Its primary function is to classify the topology of novel materials by computing bulk and slab phonon band structures, extracting phonon surface spectra, and providing analysis tools such as Wilson loop calculations and Weyl node detection. The workflow is analogous to that of established electronic topology codes like Wannier90 and WannierTools. It also incorporates long-range polar interactions during the wannierization process, making Simphony one of the first tools capable of diagnosing topology in polar insulators.

Recently, the study of novel physical properties arising from the combination of altermagnetism and other matter phases has attracted widespread attention, such as the integration of altermagnetism and topology. However, research on the combination of altermagnetism and charge density waves remains relatively sparse. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate for the first time that altermagnetism and charge density waves can coexist in a two-dimensional material and predict monolayer WO to be such a material. Moreover, our calculations reveal that the altermagnetic order in monolayer WO stabilizes the $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave. Further, the $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave is not driven by Fermi-surface nesting but rather by strong electron-phonon coupling. More importantly, the $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave in monolayer WO leads to an anomalous transition from semimetal to metal. Therefore, we realize an anomalous charge density wave phase in altermagnetic WO. Considering the strong electron-phonon coupling and good metallic properties in the altermagnetic charge density wave state, our work may provide new insights into the realization of nontrivial altermagnetic superconductivity.

Photovoltaic materials facilitate the conversion of sunlight into electricity by harnessing the interaction between light and matter, offering an eco-friendly and cost-efficient energy solution. Combining data-driven approaches with static and time-dependent density functional theories and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, we predict 14 high-performance photoabsorber materials from a family of known quaternary semiconductors. Among these, we investigate four compounds - SrCuGdSe3, SrCuDyTe3, BaCuLaSe3, and BaCuLaTe3 in greater detail. Hybrid density functional theory calculations including spin-orbit coupling reveal that SrCuGdSe3, SrCuDyTe3, BaCuLaSe3 and BaCuLaTe3 possess direct band gaps of 1.65, 1.79, 1.05, and 1.01 eV, respectively. These band gap values lie close to an optimal range ideal for visible-light absorption. Consequently, the calculated optical absorption coefficient and spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency for these compounds become comparable or larger than crystalline silicon, GaAs, and methylammonium lead iodide. Calculated exciton binding energies for these compounds are relatively small (30-32 meV), signifying easy separation of the electron-hole pairs, and hence enhanced power conversion efficiencies. Investigations of photoexcited carrier dynamics reveal a relatively long carrier lifetime (~ 30-40 ns), suggesting suppressed nonradiative recombination and enhanced photo-conversion efficiencies. We further determined the defect formation energies in these compounds, which showed that despite the likely formation of cation vacancies and interstitial defects, midgap states remain absent making these defects non-detrimental to carrier recombination. Our theoretical predictions invite experimental verification and encourage further investigations of these and similar compounds in this quaternary semiconductor family.

Soichiro Tottori, Rohit Karnik
Biological systems rely on ions and molecules as information carriers rather than electrons, motivating the development of devices that interface with biochemical systems for sensing, information processing, and actuation via spatiotemporal control of ions and molecules. Iontronics aims to achieve this vision by constructing devices composed of ion-conducting materials such as polyelectrolyte hydrogels, but advancing beyond simple single-stage circuit configurations that operate under steady-state conditions is a challenge. Here, we propose and model more complex ionic circuits, namely bistable flip-flop and ring oscillators, consisting of multiple ionic bipolar junction transistors (IBJTs). We begin by modeling and characterizing single IBJTs using both a simplified one-dimensional Nernst-Planck model and a more-detailed two-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, elucidating the effects of geometry, size, and fixed charge on the IBJT performance and response time. The one- and two-dimensional models exhibit good agreement, indicating negligible transverse inhomogeneities. Additionally, these models show that reducing the base width improves current amplification, a behavior analogous to electronic BJTs. Building on this understanding, by using the IBJTs as voltage inverters and buffers, we design and model more complex ionic circuits that dynamically change their states in response to ionic signals. Specifically, we demonstrate that the ionic flip-flop retains one-bit memory and that the ring oscillator achieves autonomous periodic self-oscillation without an external clock. Our work provides a foundation for designing dynamic iontronic circuitry using ionic conductors, enabling biochemical signal processing and logic operations based on ionic transport.

The microstructural stability and mechanical properties of superalloys at high temperatures are significantly influenced by the composition and nature of the solutes they contain. Most of the alloys with high solvus temperature have higher gamma prime coarsening resistance, while the larger lattice misfit is attributed to higher gamma prime coarsening rate. In this work, we explore the influence of Co on the microstructure evolution, thermophysical/mechanical properties and gamma prime precipitate coarsening kinetics in a Ti-rich Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Ti based alloy. More specifically, we focus on the effect of partitioning of Co into the gamma matrix on the redistribution of other solutes across the interface. We observe a significant increase in the coarsening resistance and a twofold increase in the activation energy with the increase in the Co composition from 10at.%Co to 30at.%Co, even though the gamma prime solvus reduces by 75C. As otherwise, a higher solvus, usually, indicates better microstructural stability at high temperatures. We employed a combined experimental and theoretical approach by atom probe tomography (APT) and CALPHAD simulations to probe the critical role of Co partitioning to gamma matrix on the solute transport in the gamma matrix and flux across the gamma/gamma prime interfaces, which is found to control the overall gamma prime coarsening behavior in the alloy. The observed behavior was rationlised by the proposition of a simplistic unified coarsening rate expression that successfully decouples thermodynamic and kinetic contributions. Additionally, we also observe that the gamma prime volume fraction dominates over the gamma prime precipitate size on the 0.2% yield strength (YS) of the alloys.

Yichen Chu, Qizhong Zhu
Trions, charged quasiparticles formed by binding an exciton to an excess charge carrier, dominate the optical response of doped transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and the study of the transport properties of trions in TMDs may have application in developing high-speed excitonic and optoelectronic devices. However, an important building block for low-dissipation optoelectronic devices that provides dissipationless transport channels for trions has remained elusive. Here, we propose the concept of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological trion insulator that features helical dissipationless edge states for trions. This is realized for intralayer trions, which inherit the valley-orbit coupling of intralayer excitons in TMDs subject to a moir\'e periodic potential. We find that under certain circumstances, the moir\'e trion band becomes topological, characterized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological number. We further provide two specific material realizations of this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator: a doped monolayer TMD placed on top of a twisted hBN substrate, and a generic twisted TMD heterobilayer. We also examine the effect of charge screening and find that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological trion insulator remains robust. Our work paves the way toward realizing dissipationless excitonic devices.

Antonio Patr\'on Castro, John Bechhoefer, David A. Sivak
We study the optimal performance of an information engine consisting of an overdamped Brownian bead confined in a controllable, $d$-dimensional harmonic trap and additionally subjected to gravity. The trap's center is updated dynamically via a feedback protocol designed such that no external work is done by the trap on the bead, while maximizing the extraction of gravitational potential energy and achieving directed motion. We show that performance strikingly improves when thermal fluctuations in directions perpendicular to gravity are harnessed. This improvement arises from feedback cooling of these transverse degrees of freedom, along which all heat is extracted; comparable performance can be achieved even without vertical measurements. This engine design modularizes the functions of harnessing fluctuations and storing free energy, drawing a close analogy to the Szilard engine.

The origin of charge transport and magnetization anisotropy was studied in DyB12, an antiferromagnetic (AF) metal with Neel temperature TN = 16.3 K that exhibits both cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions of the fcc crystal structure and nanoscale electronic instabilities (dynamic charge stripes). Based on the results obtained the magnetic field (H) vs temperature (T) phase diagrams have been constructed. Moreover, from angle dependent magnetoresistance and magnetization measurements the butterfly-type patterns of the H-phi magnetic phase diagram in the (110) plane were created, which include a number of different magnetic phases separated from each other by radial and circular boundaries. Several positive and negative contributions to magnetoresistance were separated and analyzed, providing arguments in favor of the important role of the spin density wave 5d-component in the magnetic structure of AF state. We argue that charge fluctuations in stripes are responsible for the suppression of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) indirect exchange between the nearest neighbored Dy3+ ions located along the same 110 directions, as these dynamic charge stripes produce the magnetic phase diversity and the butterfly-type anisotropy in DyB12.

Mathias S. Scheurer, Harley D. Scammell
Recent experiments on the kagome metal Cs$_3$Sb$_5$ reveal a curious phase transition-like feature: a nematic magnetic torque response that abruptly sets in at $T_\tau \approx 130$~K, above the known charge density wave transition at $T_\text{CDW} \approx 100$~K. Counterintuitively, elastoresistance measurements--a standard probe of nematicity--show no corresponding signal, ruling out a nematic phase transition and placing strong constraints on possible explanations. Beyond nematicity, the torque is paramagnetic for in-plane magnetic field, while above a critical out-of-plane field, an in-plane magnetisation appears, accompanied by hysteresis. We show that this combination of features cannot be accounted for by charge density waves or intraband magnetic order. Instead, we propose that interband ordering--via a symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling and a time-reversal and spatial symmetry-breaking interband order parameter--together with a background strain field, consistent with typical experimental conditions, provides a natural explanation; in our picture, the behaviour at $T_\tau$ is understood as a crossover in the symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling strength. Our theory accounts for the nematic magnetic torque, hysteresis, and the transition-like onset at $T_\tau$, while also making testable predictions, including strain-induced magnetisation. In doing so, it challenges the prevailing view of the normal state.

Mu-Kun Lee, Javier A. V\'elez, Rub\'en M. Otxoa, Masahito Mochizuki
The commonly believed absence of skyrmion Hall effect for topologically trivial magnetic skyrmions is reconsidered for bilayer skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets driven by spin-transfer and spin-orbit torques. Using a general Lagrangian formalism, we show that Bloch-type bilayer skyrmions acquire a finite Hall angle when driven by spin-orbit torque, while N\'{e}el-type skyrmions do not, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations. Both types of skyrmions exhibit current-induced elliptical deformation with minor and major axes aligned longitudinally and transversely to their velocity, respectively. A linear relation between velocity and longitudinal radius is derived with a coefficient proportional to the strength of spin-orbit torque. These effects are critical for antiferromagnetic skyrmion-based applications such as skyrmion racetrack memory. The Lagrange equations also reproduce the linear Hall angle-helicity relation reported by Msiska et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 17, 064015 (2022). An intuitive explanation of the skyrmion Hall effect for arbitrary helicity based on the antiferromagnetic exchange torque is also provided.

Shuta Kikuchi, Nozomu Togawa, Shu Tanaka
To enhance the performance of quantum annealing machines, several methods have been proposed to reduce the number of spins by fixing spin values through preprocessing. We proposed a hybrid optimization method that combines a simulated annealing (SA)-based non-quantum-type Ising machine with a quantum annealing machine. However, its applicability remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the hybrid method on large-size Ising models and analyzed its characteristics. The results indicate that the hybrid method improves upon solutions obtained by the preprocessing SA, even if the Ising models cannot be embedded in the quantum annealing machine. We analyzed the method from three perspectives: preprocessing, spin-fixed sub-Ising model generation method, and the accuracy of the quantum annealing machine. From the viewpoint of the minimum energy gap, we found that solving the sub-Ising model with a quantum annealing machine results in a higher solution accuracy than solving the original Ising model. Additionally, we demonstrated that the number of fixed spins and the accuracy of the quantum annealing machine affect the dependency of the solution accuracy on the sub-Ising model size.

We report the synthesis, crystal structure and magnetic properties of the triply-capped, slightly distorted trigonal-prismatic complex [Er(PPTMP)$_2$(H$_2$O)][OTf]$_3$ (PPTMP = (4-(6-(1,10-phenanthrolin-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)methyl pivalate) ($\mathbf{1}$). Complex $\mathbf{1}$ is shown to exhibit field-induced slow relaxation of the magnetisation at $B = 0.1\,\mathrm{T}$ via two distinct relaxation paths. Using tunable high-frequency/high-field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we experimentally determine the effective $g$-factors and zero field splittings of the two energetically lowest Kramers doublets (KD). Our data reveal that the triply-capped, slightly distorted trigonal-prismatic ligand field favours an $m \simeq \pm 9/2$ magnetic ground state, while the main contribution to the first excited KD at $\Delta_{1 \rightarrow 2} = 780(5)\,\mathrm{GHz}$ is suggested to be $m \simeq \pm 5/2$. The ground state $g$-tensor has generally axial form but hosts significant transversal components, which we conclude to be the source of SMM-silent behaviour in zero field. Our findings are backed up by ab-initio spin-orbit configuration interaction calculations showing excellent agreement with the experimental data.

Spin shuttling offers a promising approach for developing scalable silicon-based quantum processors by addressing the connectivity limitations of quantum dots (QDs). In this work, we demonstrate high-fidelity bucket-brigade (BB) spin shuttling in a silicon MOS device, utilizing Pauli Spin Blockade (PSB) readout. We achieve an average shuttling fidelity of \SI{99.8}{\percent}. The residual shuttling error is highly sensitive to the ratio between interdot tunnel coupling and Zeeman splitting, with tuning of these parameters enabling up to a twenty-fold variation in error rate. An appropriate four-level Hamiltonian model supports our findings. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing high-performance spin shuttling systems in future quantum architectures.

Recently observed signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity of dipolar excitons have drawn enormous attention to excitonic semiconductor bilayers. In superfluids, stabilization and observation of vortex matter is usually a decisive proof of coherent condensation order. However to date, the vortex behavior in a 2D excitonic system with aligned dipole-like interactions that are long-range and everywhere repulsive has not been addressed. We here provide a theoretical description of the vortex characteristics, interaction, and lattices in a dipolar exciton superfluid, solving the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii equation, while varying the exciton dipole moments and the exciton density - both tunable in the experiment, by interlayer separation and gating, respectively. We draw particular attention to the appearance of a maximum in the density redistribution around the edge of each vortex, in the phase-space region where the dipole interactions are particularly strong, and where a transition to an incompressible exciton supersolid is expected.

Xiaotong Chen, Jianda Wu
We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain driven by a periodic magnetic field. Based on its instantaneous integrability and inherent symmetry, we analytically study the magnetization and many-body tunneling (MBT). Both of them exhibit periodicity distinct from the driving period. The magnetization is shown to be independent of the initial state and robust against perturbations, signaling the formation of discrete time crystal (DTC) order. The DTC phase is found to be continuously tunable through magnetic field. The system exhibits perfect MBT, manifested as exactly vanishing Loschmidt echo (LE) thus divergent LE rate function at half period of the DTC. Remarkably, the perfect MBT is independent of the system size, and can be traced to an effective gap closure induced by quantum geometric effects. Furthermore, the Loschmidt echo spectra entropy shows logarithmic-dependence on system size, consistent with non-thermal nature of the DTC phase. We propose a protocol using ultracold atoms for experimental realization of the DTC and MBT.

Y. M. Beltukov, A. V. Rodina, A. Alekseev, Al. L. Efros
Discontinuity of dielectric constants at the interface is a common feature of all nanostructures and semiconductor heterostructures. It gives rise to a divergence of the self-interaction potential acting on a charge near the interface, and it presents an obstruction to a perturbative description. In several limiting cases, this problem can be avoided by zeroing out the carrier wave function at the interface. In this paper, we developed a non-perturbative theory which gives a self-consistent description of carrier propagation through an interface with dielectric discontinuity. It is based on conservation of the current density propagating through the interface, and it is formulated in terms of general boundary conditions (GBC) for the wave function at the interface with a single phenomenological parameter W. For these GBC, we find exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation near the interface and the carrier energy spectrum including resonances. Using these results, we describe the photo effect at the semiconductor/vacuum interface and the electron energy spectrum in the interface quantum well, as well as the dependence of these two phenomena on the interface parameter W.

Heterostructures involving transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted significant research interest due to the richness and versatility of the underlying physical phenomena. In this work, we investigate a heterostructure consisting of a rare-earth material, specifically a Gd monolayer, interfaced with WSe$_2$. We explore its electronic structure, magnetic properties, and transport behavior, with particular emphasis on the emergence of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Both Gd and W are heavy elements, providing strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which plays a crucial role in triggering the AHE. The combination of strong SOC and inversion symmetry breaking leads to pronounced asymmetries between the $\Gamma-K$ and $\Gamma-K^\prime$ directions in the Brillouin zone. Our calculations reveal a substantial anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) at the ferromagnetic interface, primarily originating from numerous avoided crossings involving the d-states of both Gd and W near the Fermi level. Moreover, we demonstrate that the AHC is highly tunable, either by adjusting the in-plane lattice constant or by reducing the separation between Gd and WSe$_2$.

Multigap superconductivity emerges when superconducting gaps form on distinct Fermi surfaces. Arising from locally overlapping atomic orbitals, multiple superconducting bands introduce a new internal degree of freedom in the material that, however, escapes external control due to their coexistence in real space in the known multigap superconductors. Here, we show that the layered superconductor 4Hb-TaSSe - composed of alternating trigonal (H) and octahedral (T) polymorph layers - is a multigap superconductor, featuring two weakly coupled superconducting condensates with distinct properties, spatially separated in alternating layers. Using high-resolution quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection spectroscopy in the two polymorph layers, we identify two superconducting gaps that vary in size and internal structure. The intrinsic Cooper pairing in each polymorph is corroborated by the temperatures and magnetic fields at which the gaps open up, which differ in each polymorph layer and show opposing resilience to these parameters. This behavior enables selective external actuation upon the condensates. Our theoretical model based on ab-initio calculations reproduces key features of the observed superconducting gaps in the presence of finite interlayer hybridization and explains the unusually high critical field observed in the T-layer. Our results establish TMD polymorphs as platforms for engineering tunable multigap superconductors, offering new opportunities in layered superconducting device architectures.

Zi Hong Liu, Hongyu Lu, Zi Yang Meng, Lukas Janssen
Electronic systems with quadratic band touchings, commonly found in two- and three-dimensional materials such as Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, kagome metals, HgTe, and pyrochlore iridates, have attracted significant interest concerning the role of interactions in shaping their electronic properties. However, even in the simplest model of spinless fermions on a two-dimensional checkerboard lattice, the quantum phase diagram as a function of nearest-neighbor interaction remains under debate. We employ constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo simulations (CP-QMC) simulations to investigate the problem using a two-dimensional torus geometry. We cross-validate our results on small lattices by comparing them with density-matrix renormalization group calculations, finding quantitative agreement. In particular, we implement an improved optimization scheme within the CP-QMC simulations, enabling the identification of a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal phase that was found in tensor-network studies on cylindrical geometries, but remains inaccessible to Hartree-Fock mean-field methods. The CP-QMC approach makes it possible to establish the emergence of this phase in a geometry that preserves lattice rotational symmetry and permits extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Our results show that the quantum phase diagram of spinless fermions on the checkerboard lattice with nearest-neighbor repulsion features three interaction-induced phases at half filling: a quantum anomalous Hall insulator at weak coupling, a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal at intermediate coupling, and a site-nematic insulator at strong coupling.

Organic--inorganic hybrid perovskites with giant piezoelectric responses, exemplified by TMCM-CdCl$_3$, represent a promising platform for flexible and environmentally friendly electromechanical materials. However, the microscopic origin of such exceptional performance in this weakly polar system has remained elusive. Here, using deep-learning-assisted large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we resolve this paradox by reproducing the experimentally measured piezoelectric coefficient $d_{33} \approx 220$~pC/N, and demonstrating that the giant response arises from the collective contribution of multiple intrinsic components, particularly the shear component $d_{15}$. This effect does not stem from conventional polarization rotation or phase switching, but instead originates from stochastic 120$^\circ$ in-plane rotational hopping of a small fraction of organic cations. This discrete hopping mechanism is governed by the local C$_3$-symmetric halogen-bonding network between the host framework and the guest cation. The Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of $d_{15}$ further confirms the role of thermally activated dipole hopping. This work provides a clear pathway to enhance piezoelectric performance of hybrid materials through rational engineering of host--guest interactions.

We revisit the modeling framework introduced in [N. Loy and L. Preziosi: Bull. Math. Bio., 85, 2023] to describe the dynamics of cell orientation under cyclic stretch. We propose a reformulation based on the principles of Stochastic Thermodynamics with Internal Variables introduced in [T. Leadbetter, P. Purohit, and C. Reina: PNAS Nexus, 2, 2023]. This approach allows us to describe not only the evolution of the orientation distribution, but also the observed spreading phenomenon. The insight provided by our model reveals an interesting phenomenon, which we call two-stage reorientation: when cells begin aligned with an energy maximum, their orientations spread before concentrating at the energy minimum. This theoretical prediction suggests a new experiment to test this modeling framework.

[*Evaluation of hydrogen diffusion and trapping in ferritic steels containing (Ti,Cr)C particles using electrochemical permeation and thermal desorption spectroscopy*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15711 "Evaluation of hydrogen diffusion and trapping in ferritic steels containing (Ti,Cr)C particles using electrochemical permeation and thermal desorption spectroscopy")
Nicholas Winzer
Hydrogen diffusion and trapping in ferritic steels containing (Ti,Cr)C particles was investigated using electrochemical permeation (EP) and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). The trapping parameters for the test materials were evaluated by fitting the measurements with a finite element model based on the McNabb-Foster equations using least-squares optimisation. The measurements showed that hydrogen diffusion in ferrite is slowed significantly by the presence of fine (<5 nm) (Ti,Cr)C particles; coarser particles had little or no effect. The TDS measurements were consistent with hydrogen traps with a high energy barrier. The uniqueness of the hydrogen trapping parameters obtained using the fitting procedure was evaluated. It was found that the system was overdetermined; the measurements could be fitted with multiple combinations of trapping parameters. Consequently, it was not possible to determine the individual trapping parameters using this procedure. Trapping parameters were also evaluated from TDS measurements by applying Kissinger's equation. Using this procedure a trap binding energy of 0.24 eV was calculated for all materials, albeit with a high degree of uncertainty.

Thin-film solar cells based on kesterite (Cu2ZnSnSe4) material are a promising alternative for photovoltaic devices due to their composition consisting of earth abundant elements, ease of production at a relatively low temperatures and excellent optical absorption properties. Additionally, this absorber compound allows a tuneable bandgap energy in the 1 to 1.5 eV window range, which makes it an attractive candidate either as a top or a bottom solar cell in tandem technologies combined with transparent carrier-selective contacts. However, conventional kesterite devices use a toxic CdS layer as an electron-selective contact, resulting in the difficultto-dispose chemical waste. This work explores the use of a stack of ZnO and Al-doped ZnO (AZO) films deposited by ALD to replace the CdS-based contacts in kesterite devices. The inclusion of a polyethylenimine (PEI) interlayer as dipole to enhance the overall electrical contact performance is also discussed. The transparent back contact is formed by an ALD V2Ox thin layer over a FTO conductive electrode. Fabricated kesterite solar cells exhibit remarkable photocurrent density values of 35 mAcm-2, open-circuit voltage around 260 mV and efficiencies up to 3.5% using front illumination. The aforementioned photovoltaic parameters yield to 5.3 mAcm-2, 160 mV and 0.3% respectively under back illumination, demonstrating the bifaciality of the proposed structure.

Edwin A. Bedolla-Montiel, Susana Mar\'in-Aguilar, Marjolein Dijkstra
We present a comprehensive study of the structure, formation, and dynamics of a one-component model system that self-assembles into an icosahedral quasicrystal (IQC). Using molecular dynamics simulations combined with unsupervised machine learning techniques, we identify and characterize the unique structural motifs of IQCs, including icosahedral and dodecahedral arrangements, and quantify the evolution of local environments during the IQC formation process. Our analysis reveals that the formation of the IQC is driven by the emergence of distinct local clusters that serve as precursors to the fully developed quasicrystalline phase. Additionally, we examine the dynamics of the system across a range of temperatures, identifying transitions from vibrationally restricted motion to activated diffusion, and uncovering signatures of dynamic heterogeneity inherent to the quasicrystalline state. To directly connect structure and dynamics, we use a machine-learning-based order parameter to quantify the presence of distinct local environments across temperatures. We find that regions with high structural order, as captured by specific machine-learned classes, correlate with suppressed self-diffusion and minimal dynamical heterogeneity, consistent with phason-like motion within the IQC. In contrast, regions with lower structural order exhibit enhanced collective motion and increased dynamical heterogeneity. These results establish a quantitative framework for understanding the coupling between structural organization and dynamical processes in quasicrystals, providing new insights into the mechanisms governing IQC stability and dynamics.

Mathew Pollard, Visakha Ho, Clarissa Wisner, Eric Bohannan, Yew San Hor
We report the synthesis of high-quality 2H-TaS2 nanowires via a controlled two-step conversion process from TaS3 precursors, achieving robust superconductivity with a transition temperature Tc ~ 3.6 K which is significantly higher than bulk 2H-TaS2 (Tc ~ 0.8 K). Structural and compositional analyses confirm phase purity and preserved 1D morphology, while magnetotransport measurements reveal an enhanced upper critical field {\mu}oHc2 (2 K) ~ 5 T, far exceeding the bulk value ({\mu}oHc2 (0) ~ 1.17 T), attributed to dimensional confinement and suppression of charge density wave order. Magnetic characterization demonstrates complex vortex dynamics, including flux jumps and a second magnetization peak, indicative of strong pinning and crossover from elastic to plastic vortex regimes. These findings establish TaS2 nanowires as a versatile platform for studying superconductivity in reduced dimensions and exploiting confinement-driven quantum phenomena for advanced applications.

The R$_5$Pb$_3$O family was discovered decades ago, but has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report single crystal growth and basic characterization for the La and Ce members of this family. At room temperature, these compounds adopt a tetragonal structure (I4/mcm), where R and Pb atoms form linear chains along the c-axis. We identify a second-order structural phase transition at 260 K and 145 K for R = La and Ce, respectively. Single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals a lattice modulation below the transition temperature, resulting in R-Pb pairs in the z direction. The broken symmetry in the low-temperature phases results in a primitive structure with space group P4/ncc. Transport and diffraction measurements, in agreement with density functional theory calculations, support that the R$_5$Pb$_3$O (R = La and Ce) series hosts an electron-phonon coupling driven charge density wave (CDW) at low temperatures. The CDW ordering temperature is suppressed by more than 100 K by the La to Ce substitution, suggesting high pressure-sensitivity. Therefore, this family offers the potential for investigating competing orders in oxides, with heavier rare-earth members still to be explored.

Shuwen Sun, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero
Moir\'e superlattices constitute a versatile platform to investigate emergent phenomena arising from the interplay of strong correlations and topology, while offering flexible in situ tunability. However, the fabrication of such moir\'e superlattices is challenging. It is difficult to achieve highly uniform devices with a precise twist angle because of the unintentional introduction of heterostrain, twist angle disorder, and angle/lattice relaxation during the nanofabrication process. This article introduces an optimized, experience-informed protocol for fabricating high-quality graphene-based moir\'e superlattice devices, focusing on a modified dry transfer technique. The transfer process is performed in a highly tunable, custom-built transfer setup that enables precise position, angle, and temperature control. By combining rigorous flake selection criteria, pre-cleaned bubble-free bottom gates, and graphene laser ablation, the moir\'e superlattice is constructed by deliberately overlaying twisted graphene flakes at a submicron speed at room temperature. Through precise control of the transfer process, the resulting graphene moir\'e superlattice devices exhibit high uniformity and desired twist angles. This optimized protocol addresses existing challenges in the fabrication of graphene-based moir\'e superlattice devices and paves the way for further advances in the rapidly evolving field of moir\'e materials.

Kengo Anzai, Hiroaki Matsueda, Yoshihito Kuno
Noise is inevitable in realistic quantum circuits. It arises randomly in space. Inspired by spatial non-uniformity of the noise, we investigate the effects of spatial modulation on purification phase transitions in a hybrid random Clifford circuit. As an efficient observable for extracting quantum entanglement in mixed states, we employ many-body negativity. The behavior of the many-body negativity well characterizes the presence of the purification phase transitions and its criticality. We find the effect of spatial non-uniformity in measurement probability on purification phase transition. The criticality of the purification phase transition changes from that of uniform probability, which is elucidated from the argument of the Harris criterion. The critical correlation length exponent $\nu$ changes from $\nu < 2$ for uniform probability to $\nu > 2$ for spatially modulated probability. We further investigate a setting where two-site random Clifford gate becomes spatially (quasi-)modulated. We find that the modulation induces a phase transition, leading to a different pure phase where a short-range quantum entanglement remains.

Ge Li, Astrid S. de Wijn
Quick clay is a highly sensitive soil that transforms rapidly from solid to liquid under minor stress, as a result of long-term salt leaching that drastically reduces shear strength. Stabilizing it is both costly and carbon-intensive, significantly impacting construction emissions in regions like Norway. Developing greener stabilization methods is challenging due to limited understanding of the weakening mechanisms and the specific roles of different salts. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the sliding behavior of illite platelets, the key component in Norwegian quick clay, and how it is affected by the different ions in the solution surrounding the surface. We examine the impact of monovalent (NaCl, KCl, CsCl) and divalent (MgCl2 and CaCl2) salts on platelet-surface interactions, focusing on the friction enhancement brought by divalent salts and how the electric double layer (EDL) structure mediates frictional behavior. We find that divalent cations sit higher on top of the surface, and lead to an increase in friction, while monovalent cations sit closer to the surface. By providing a detailed analysis of these interactions, the study offers a novel framework for understanding the role of salts in clay mechanics and highlights opportunities to design environmentally friendly stabilizers as alternatives to traditional lime and cement.

Sang-Wook Cheong, Fei-Ting Huang
The flow of time moves in one direction in any spatial position and orientation in this universe. Chiral objects, which lack mirror symmetry, retain their chirality regardless of their position or orientation. Despite being seemingly independent, time and chirality share common features such as universality -- applying to 'any position and orientation' -- and a binary nature, such as forward/backward time flow versus left/right chirality. We introduce the concept of Time Chirality and discuss the conjugate relationship between time chirality and traditional chirality. We explore how time chirality can manifest in certain magnetic states, and examine the novel physical phenomena associated with time-chiral magnetic states. This discussion offers a fresh perspective on true time reversal symmetry breaking and temporal nonreciprocity.

The Big Data revolution has heightened the demand for robust, energy-efficient security hardware capable of withstanding increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Conventional encryption schemes, reliant on complex algorithms, are resource-intensive and remain vulnerable. To fortify sensitive information, society needs innovative anti-hacking and anti-counterfeiting technologies that exploit new materials and designs. Here, we present a magneto-ionic strategy for hardware-level security based on fully selective voltage-controlled N3- ion migration within pre-defined, initially paramagnetic FeCoN dots. This process generates ferromagnetic sublayers of tuneable thickness, resulting in either deterministic (single-domain or vortex) or probabilistic states (with coexisting magnetic configurations and voltage-adjustable probabilities), each exhibiting stochastic orientation and chirality, thereby providing a rich platform for magnetic fingerprinting. This approach enables self-protected primitives, including true random number generators, physical unclonable functions, and in-memory probabilistic inference. The resulting reconfigurable architecture combines tamper resistance, low energy consumption, and scalability, marking a significant leap toward next-generation hardware security rooted in emergent magnetic phenomena.

Shuai Lu, Shuzhe Shi
The Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy provides a time-reversal-symmetric framework for describing the nonequilibrium evolution of many-body systems. Despite the success of Boltzmann-based numerical approaches, systematically extending beyond this lowest-order truncation to the full nonlinear BBGKY hierarchy remains a major challenge. Moreover, even at the Boltzmann level, accurately treating the nonlinear collision term still presents significant difficulties. Here we propose the spectral BBGKY hierarchy, an analytically equivalent and numerically tractable reformulation of the conventional BBGKY hierarchy. The spectral formulation reduces the original 6n-dimensional phase-space problem to the evolution of spectral coefficients over the 3n-dimensional coordinate space. We also develop an analytic scheme for computing the collision integrals, which achieves high accuracy and removes the need for ensemble averaging over repeated stochastic evolutions from the same initial state. The scheme evaluates the full eight-fold integral exactly for massless particles, and reduces it to a three-fold one for massive particles. The validity of the spectral BBGKY hierarchy is verified through conservation law analysis, comparison with an analytical solution, convergence tests, and analysis of spectral coefficient leakage. At minimal truncation, the spectral BBGKY yields a spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation that captures full dynamics with a computational cost comparable to that of linearized approaches. When extended to higher-order truncations, the spectral BBGKY hierarchy provides a flexible framework for studying multiparticle correlations. This framework advances our ability to investigate the early thermalization puzzle in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and to elucidate the applicability of hydrodynamics at remarkably early stages of quark-gluon plasma evolution.

Unlocking the potential of nanomaterials in medicine and environmental science hinges on understanding their interactions with proteins, a complex decision space where AI is poised to make a transformative impact. However, progress has been hindered by limited datasets and the restricted generalizability of existing models. Here, we propose NanoPro-3M, the largest nanomaterial-protein interaction dataset to date, comprising over 3.2 million samples and 37,000 unique proteins. Leveraging this, we present NanoProFormer, a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization, handling missing features, and unseen nanomaterials or proteins. We show that multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference and fine-tuning. Together, this work establishes a solid foundation for high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro applications.

Ziqi Wang, Hongshuo Huang, Hancheng Zhao, Changwen Xu, Shang Zhu, Jan Janssen, Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan
Materials discovery relies on high-throughput, high-fidelity simulation techniques such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), which require years of training, extensive parameter fine-tuning and systematic error handling. To address these challenges, we introduce the DFT-based Research Engine for Agentic Materials Screening (DREAMS), a hierarchical, multi-agent framework for DFT simulation that combines a central Large Language Model (LLM) planner agent with domain-specific LLM agents for atomistic structure generation, systematic DFT convergence testing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) scheduling, and error handling. In addition, a shared canvas helps the LLM agents to structure their discussions, preserve context and prevent hallucination. We validate DREAMS capabilities on the Sol27LC lattice-constant benchmark, achieving average errors below 1\% compared to the results of human DFT experts. Furthermore, we apply DREAMS to the long-standing CO/Pt(111) adsorption puzzle, demonstrating its long-term and complex problem-solving capabilities. The framework again reproduces expert-level literature adsorption-energy differences. Finally, DREAMS is employed to quantify functional-driven uncertainties with Bayesian ensemble sampling, confirming the Face Centered Cubic (FCC)-site preference at the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) DFT level. In conclusion, DREAMS approaches L3-level automation - autonomous exploration of a defined design space - and significantly reduces the reliance on human expertise and intervention, offering a scalable path toward democratized, high-throughput, high-fidelity computational materials discovery.

This paper presents a comparative analysis of algorithmic strategies for fitting tessellation models to 3D image data of materials such as polycrystals and foams. In this steadily advancing field, we review and assess optimization-based methods -- including linear and nonlinear programming, stochastic optimization via the cross-entropy method, and gradient descent -- for generating Voronoi, Laguerre, and generalized balanced power diagrams (GBPDs) that approximate voxelbased grain structures. The quality of fit is evaluated on real-world datasets using discrepancy measures that quantify differences in grain volume, surface area, and topology. Our results highlight trade-offs between model complexity, the complexity of the optimization routines involved, and the quality of approximation, providing guidance for selecting appropriate methods based on data characteristics and application needs.

Ant\'onio Antunes, Junchen Rong
Irrational CFTs in 1+1d with a discrete spectrum and no conserved currents other than the stress-tensor are expected to be generic, unsolvable by standard methods, and hard to construct explicitly. We introduce a lattice model that realizes a candidate for such a CFT as a conformal phase of matter without fine-tuning. The model is constructed by coupling $N\geq2$ golden anyon chains together, preserving $N$ copies of the Fibonacci non-invertible symmetry. We use the MPS/DMRG approach to study this model numerically, which allows us to calculate the corresponding conformal data, obtaining hints of its irrationality. As a byproduct of our analysis, we provide an extensive list of rational CFTs with $1<2.1$.

We determine whether excitonic effects affect predictions of dark matter (DM)-electron scattering rates by calculating the energy- and momentum-dependent energy-loss function, including electron-hole interaction excitonic effects, for the dark-matter scintillating detector materials GaAs and NaI. By comparing our results using the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the framework of many-body perturbation theory, which explicitly includes excitonic effects, with those using the quasiparticle random-phase approximation, which includes only electron-electron interaction and crystal local-field effects, we find that excitonic effects in NaI significantly increase the predicted scattering rate at low energy and as a result improve the cross-section sensitivity considering a realistic background. In contrast, the predicted scattering rate and the DM-electron scattering cross-section for GaAs are minimally affected by excitonic effects.

Nadav Shaibe, Jared M. Erb, Steven M. Anlage
Vortex singularities and their speckle patterns in random superpositions of waves are an inevitable consequence of destructive interference and are consequently generic and ubiquitous. Singularities are topologically stable, they persist under small perturbations and can only be removed via pairwise annihilation. They have found application in optical, acoustic, elastic, and fluid wave fields, among others. We generalize the concept of singularity speckle patterns to arbitrary two dimensional parameter spaces and any complex scalar function that describes wave phenomena involving complicated scattering. In scattering systems specifically, we are often concerned with singularities associated with complex zeros of the scattering matrix S. Some examples are Coherent Perfect Absorption (CPA), Reflectionless Scattering Modes (RSMs), Transmissionless Scattering Modes (TSMs), and S-matrix Exceptional Points (EPs). All scattering singularities empirically share a universal statistical property: the tail of the probability distribution function of a quantity that diverges only at a singularity has the form of a -3 power law. The heavy tail of the distribution provides an estimate for the likelihood of finding a given singularity in a generic scattering system. We use these universal statistical results to determine that homogeneous system loss is the most important parameter determining singularity density in a given parameter space. Finally, we discuss events where distinct singularities coincide in parameter space, which result in higher order singularities that have new applications. These higher order singularities are not topologically protected, and we do not find universal statistical properties for them. We support our empirical results from microwave experiments with Random Matrix Theory simulations and conclude that all results presented are found in all generic scattering systems.

Noah M. MacKay
In this study, we model a spin-network in loop quantum gravity as a regular tetrahedral lattice, applying lattice physics techniques to study its structure and vertex dynamics. Using the area eigenvalue, $A\propto 8\pi l_P^2$, we derive a lattice constant $a = 2.707\,l_P$ and construct a vertex Hamiltonian incorporating a Lennard-Jones potential, zero-point energy, and simple harmonic oscillations. A foliation approach enforces the Wheeler-DeWitt constraint via locally non-zero Hamiltonians that globally cancel. Graviton-like perturbations (treated here as spin-0 bosons) modify the vertex energy spectrum, with variational analysis suggesting twelve coherent excitations per vertex. This model frames flat spacetime as a graviton-rich lattice while enforcing a Brownian-like stochastic picture for the gravitons, and offers a basis for extension into curved quantum geometries.

Optical imaging below the limit of light diffraction offers an unprecedented opportunity to study outlook, organization, interactions or in-situ functioning of sub-micrometer, highly transparent objects such as subcellular structures in vitro, thin layers or nano-engineered devices. However, most of current methodologies require to use specially designed luminescent labels, which not only may affect the properties of the sample itself, but often are (photo)toxic, susceptible to photobleaching, offer limited color combinations or specificity of labeling. Moreover, the dedicated fluorescence based super-resolution optical techniques are often technically complex and cumbersome to use. The existing non-destructive, non-invasive and label-free super-resolution imaging (SRI) methods are also challenging, complex and elusive to apply. To address these issues, here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new concept of label-free sub-diffraction optical imaging. The transmission avalanche backlight (TAB) microscopy exploits huge optical non-linearities of photon avalanching materials, which are acting as a virtual near-field nano aperture - a diffraction limited backlight of the actual sample. Such approach enables to augment imaging contrast of highly transparent samples and thin layers, by translating small attenuation and scattering loses occurring on these translucent samples into amplified modulation of luminescence intensity of the avalanche backlighted substrate (ABS). At no additional cost, sub-diffraction imaging is achieved with simple, single beam laser scanning microscopy setup, leading to ca. 70 nm optical resolution. This far-field, label-free, raster scanning imaging technique, with augmented contrast and optical imaging resolution below diffraction limit, may become pivotal for studies in biology, physics, materials science, nanophotonics and nanoengineering

Light-matter interactions in two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant interest due to their distinctive optical and electronic properties. Recently, silicates have emerged as a promising new class of 2D materials, but their nonlinear optical properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate layer-dependent nonlinear absorption and optical limiting capabilities of 2D muscovite using femtosecond laser excitation at 450 nm. The two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient is highly sensitive to both the number of layers and excitation intensity, increasing markedly from (3.91+/-0.06)x10^3 cm GW^-1 in multilayer structures to (6.94+/-0.17)x10^5 cm GW^-1 in the monolayer limit at a peak intensity of 68 GW cm^-2, highlighting a strong layer-dependent enhancement in nonlinear absorption. Additionally, monolayer muscovite exhibits an optical limiting threshold of 1.46 mJ cm^-2, outperforming graphene and other 2D dichalcogenides. This enhanced TPA arises from quantum confinement and intrinsic lattice defects that facilitate nonlinear optical transitions. Density functional theory reveals that liquid-phase exfoliation disrupts potassium interlayers and induces oxygen vacancies, generating mid-gap electronic states that significantly enhance TPA. These insights open new avenues for designing low-fluence, high-efficiency optical limiters using 2D silicates.

Saurav Samanta, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Entropy of matter in a very strong gravity depends on cross-sectional area of the container of the system -- is being further bolstered by calculating entropy of a monoatomic gas kept under uniform strong gravity at Newtonian scale. This bypasses the earlier analysis where existence of horizon is crucial. Also the extensivity of this entropy has been discussed in the light of the same of a two-space dimensional ultra-relativistic non-interacting gas without gravity. The whole analysis, as far as entropy is concerned, indicates that under strong gravity the microscopic degrees of freedom of the system are effectively contributed by the cross-sectional area of the system.

Dhiman Bhowmick, Wen Wei Ho
In a work by Granovskii and Zhedanov, a surprising scar state exhibiting zero entanglement and long periodicity was discovered in the XYZ spin chains; remarkably, nearly three decades before the concept of many-body scars became a subject of active research. In this study, we uncover the origin of the Granovskii-Zhedanov (GZ) scar within the framework of the modern understanding of quantum many-body scars. We demonstrate that the scar subspace can be effectively described using the standard spectrum-generating algebra (SGA) framework and through a group-theoretical formulation of the Hamiltonian. This description, however, is applicable only in the XXZ limit, where a quasi-$U(1)$ symmetry exists within the scar subspace. In contrast, the absence of such quasi-$U(1)$ symmetry for the GZ scar subspace restricts the applicability of these standard formulations. We propose two alternative techniques: approximated SGA and generalized SGA, which construct and describe the scar subspace in the XYZ case. Using these approaches, we can characterize the scar subspaces. We further explore the possibility of constructing lattice-independent GZ scars in higher-dimensional uniform spin-exchange systems with centrosymmetry, using graphical rules developed for GZ scar construction. Our results indicate that lattice-independent GZ scars cannot be supported on uniform lattices with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of edges, while uniform lattices featuring even coordination numbers and even-edged plaquettes can host such lattice-independent scars in specific scenarios. Remarkably, if certain bonds retain the full $SU(2)$ symmetry of the spin-exchange interaction, thereby breaking the spatial uniformity of the lattice, lattice-independent GZ scars can still emerge in systems with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of edges.

Dark current in silicon-based blocked impurity band (BIB) infrared detectors has long been a critical limitation on device performance. This work proposes a chiral-phonon-assisted spin current model at interfaces to explain the parabolic-like dark current behavior observed at low bias voltages. Concurrently, the spatially-confined charge transport theory is employed to elucidate the dark current generation mechanism across the entire operational voltage range.

We bring attention to the fact that the claim of Brambilla et.al. [Extreme Mechanics Letters 74 (2025) 102267; arXiv:2406.14502] of discovering a novel design for pentamode materials is incorrect.

[*Transversal non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes breaking the $\sqrt{N}$ distance barrier and quantum-inspired geometry with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ systolic freedom*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15056 "Transversal non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes breaking the $\sqrt{N}$ distance barrier and quantum-inspired geometry with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ systolic freedom")
Guanyu Zhu
Historically, a $\sqrt{N}log^{1/2}(N)$ distance barrier for quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with $N$ qubits persisted for nearly two decades, until the recent discovery of the fibre-bundle code. An open question is whether such a distance barrier can be broken while preserving the ability to perform transversal non-Clifford gates. In this direction, another long-standing distance barrier of $N^{1/3}$ for LDPC stabilizer codes -- present since the discovery of the 3D color code -- was only recently overcome by a construction achieving an $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ distance (arXiv:2501.19375). The present work further breaks the $\sqrt{N}$ distance barrier by taking a homological product of three good qLDPC codes, combined with the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping and the triple cup product to implement transversal CCZ gates. The resulting code achieves an $\Omega(N^{2/3})$ distance (a linear $X$-distance of $\Theta(N)$) and a dimension of $\Theta(N^{2/3})$, which enables fault-tolerant preparation of $\Theta(N^{1/3})$ independent logical CCZ magic states in a single shot, without distillation (`magic state fountain'). This new quantum code also inspires the discovery of a family of exotic $3q$-dimensional manifolds $\mathcal{M}$, which exhibit both a power-law $\mathbb{Z}_2$-($q$, $2q$)-systolic freedom and $\Theta(vol(\mathcal{M}))$ triple intersection points of $2q$-dimensional submanifolds.

Kurt Langfeld, Amanda Turner
The study of critical phenomena in one-dimensional field theories with long-range interactions has garnered significant attention following the implications of the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, which precludes phase transitions in most low-dimensional theories with local interactions. This research investigates a novel class of one-dimensional theories characterised by a distinctly defined infinite interaction range. We propose that such theories emerge naturally through a mesoscopic feedback mechanism. In this proof-of-concept study, we examine Ising-type models and demonstrate that the natural emergence of phase transitions, criticality, and previously unidentified universality classes is evident.

Nan An, Mingtong Chen, Zhengbao Yang
We propose a modular, fast and large-area fabrication of bio-piezoelectric films. The technique is based on the formation of cone-jet mode by applying a high voltage electric field to conductive spiked metal disks. And the self-assembly process of biomolecular materials through nanoconfinement with in-situ poling effect. This job achieved print speeds of up to 9.2 109 um3/s with a combination of only 2 printheads. At the same time, the modular design allows the MLSP to achieve theoretically unlimited print efficiency. It also provides flexible configuration options for different printing needs, such as preparing films of different areas and shapes. In short, MLSP demonstrates the ability of piezoelectric biomaterials to undergo ultra-fast, large-scale assembly. Demonstrates good potential as a universally applicable bio-device for the fabrication of bio-piezoelectric films

Kenichiro Tateishi, Shuji Otsuka, Akihiro Yamaji, Shunsuke Kurosawa, Tomohiro Uesaka
1H polarization of 61% was achieved by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization using photoexcited triplet electrons (Triplet-DNP) at room temperature and in 0.64 T. We introduced dibenz[a, h]anthracene as a new host molecule of the polarizing agent, pentacene-d14. Its rigid structure provides a long spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) of more than 2 hours at room temperature. The single crystal of dibenz[a, h]anthracene doped with 0.05 mol% pentacene-d14 was grown by the Bridgman method, and cut into a small piece of ~1 mg for Triplet-DNP experiment. The 1H polarization buildup and relaxation measurements indicated that paramagnetic relaxation became the major source of the relaxation than spin-lattice relaxation. Finally, two promising applications of room-temperature hyperpolarization, i .e. nuclear ordering and radiation-tolerant polarized target, are discussed.

Liang Zhang, Kong Chen, Yuen Wu
Accurately and comprehensively representing crystal structures is critical for advancing machine learning in large-scale crystal materials simulations, however, effectively capturing and leveraging the intricate geometric and topological characteristics of crystal structures remains a core, long-standing challenge for most existing methods in crystal property prediction. Here, we propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.

Pritam Das, Devarshi Chakrabarty, Neha Gill, Sajal Dhara
Anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors recently have emerged as a promising platform for polarization-controlled Raman amplification. In this study, we probe energy-dependent resonant Raman scattering in few layer ReS2 under different polarization configurations. We identify two distinct excitation regimes, each characterized by a resonance condition where either the pump or the Stokes photon energy aligns with an excitonic transition. A two-order-of-magnitude enhancement in Raman intensity is observed when the pump energy is tuned near the exciton resonance. Under Stokes-resonant conditions, additional Raman lines accompanied by excitonic photoluminescence are observed, suggesting the participation of non-Bloch intermediate states in the scattering process. These findings shed light into the influence of excitons in modulating nonlinear optical phenomena in anisotropic 2D materials, offering valuable insights for the design of tunable photonic and optoelectronic devices based on anisotropic layered materials.

[129]. [*Anatomy of Non-Hermitian Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15384 "Anatomy of Non-Hermitian Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions")
Yongxu Fu, Gao Xianlong
We establish a unified framework for dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in non-Hermitian systems that encompasses both biorthogonal and self-norm non-biorthogonal formulations for pure and mixed states. Our framework provides explicit expressions for the Loschmidt amplitude, Loschmidt echo, and rate function, revealing a universal geometric signature of DQPTs: orthogonality of two related vectors in two-dimensional real space. Strikingly, we demonstrate that non-biorthogonal quenches from non-Hermitian to Hermitian Hamiltonians under chiral symmetry exhibit emergent topological characteristics, unveiling the intrinsic topological nature of DQPTs beyond conventional Hermitian regimes. This work establishes fundamental geometric and topological principles governing quantum criticality in open systems, with implications for quantum sensing and many-body physics in dissipative environments.

Wei-Can Syu, Tien Hsieh, Da-Shin Lee
In this paper, we study the spectrum of the Regge poles (RPs), which are the counterparts of quasinormal modes, in a draining bathtub vortex within a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) system. We study the gapped excitations of the condensate with the spatially dependent energy gap term using a spatially tunable Rabi coupling, which will be treated as a perturbation. This model serves as an analogue of a rotating black hole surrounded by an environmental mass shell. We first compute the semiclassical scattering amplitude with the spatially independent mass effect due to the orbital interference. In the case of the mass-shell, bifurcation of the spectrum is observed, resulting in the destabilization of the RPs. We also study the migration of RPs by shifting the bump position. Our results show that the RPs of the co-rotating modes exhibit greater stability than those of the counter-rotating modes. Large migration and overtaking jumps of the overtone (fundamental RP) leave an imprint on the scattering amplitude at small (large) scattering angles. This can be observed in the scattering interference pattern in experiments.

Christian Copetti
Symmetry breaking of continuous symmetries by extended dynamical defects entails the existence of continuous families of defects, which form conformal manifolds in a critical setup. In the presence of bulk 't Hooft anomalies, defects are in fact required to break the symmetry: defect conformal manifolds are anomaly-enforced. We show that, by coupling the system to a modulated deformation parameter, the geometric structure of the conformal manifold is sensible to the 't Hooft anomaly. This leads to measurable effects in the presence of a boundary/defect: in (1+1)d the anomaly predicts a quantized boundary charge pumping, while in higher dimensions it gives rise to non-dissipative boundary Hall currents.

[132]. [*Linearly-polarized few-cycle pulses drive carrier envelope phase-sensitive coherent magnetization injection*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15490 "Linearly-polarized few-cycle pulses drive carrier envelope phase-sensitive coherent magnetization injection")
Ofer Neufeld
Circularly-polarized light is well-known to induce, or flip the direction of, magnetization in solids. At its heart, this arises from time-reversal symmetry breaking by the vector potential, causing inverse-Faraday or analogous physical effects. We show here that very short few-cycle pulses can cause similar phenomena even when they are linearly-polarized and off-resonant. We analyze the new effect with ab-initio calculations and demonstrate that it similarly arises due to broken time-reversal symmetry and is carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) sensitive. Coherently tuning the CEP causes the induced magnetism to oscillate from zero to few percent Bohr magneton within few femtoseconds. By changing the laser angle and intensity, the magnetization sign and magnitude can be controlled. Remarkably, due to the nature of the physical mechanism that relies on spin-orbit interactions and orbital currents, the magnetization survives CEP-averaging and the effect should be accessible even in the absence of CEP stabilization. Our work opens new routes for ultrafast coherent tuning and probing of magnetism and circumvents the need for circularly-polarized driving or external magnetic fields.

Yichun Pan, Liqing Zhu, Yongsheng Hu, Xin Kong, Tao Wang, Wei Xie, Weihang Zhou
The transport of excitons lies at the heart of excitonic devices. Probing, understanding, and manipulating excitonic transport represents a critical step prior to their technological applications. In this work, we report experimental studies on the ultrafast nonlinear transport of excitons in monolayer WS2. Under intense optical pumping, we observed an ultrafast spatial hole burning effect in the excitonic emission profile, followed by a re-brightening at even higher pumping density. By means of time- and spatially-resolved photoluminescence imaging spectroscopy, we revealed the underlying mechanism responsible for these nontrivial excitonic diffusion dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the combined effects of ultrafast exciton-exciton annihilation, efficient hole trapping by intrinsic sulfur vacancy defects, and laser-induced photo-oxidation govern the evolution of exciton transport under strong optical excitation. The observed dynamics are in excellent agreement with our diffusion model simulations, providing new insights into the nonlinear excitonic transport behaviors as well as their optical control mechanism in two-dimensional semiconductors.

Ferenc Bencs, Kuikui Liu, Guus Regts
Spin glasses are fundamental probability distributions at the core of statistical physics, the theory of average-case computational complexity, and modern high-dimensional statistical inference. In the mean-field setting, we design deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithms for estimating the partition function to arbitrarily high accuracy for nearly all inverse temperatures in the second moment regime. In particular, for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, our algorithms succeed for almost the entire replica-symmetric phase. To achieve this, we study the locations of the zeros of the partition function. Notably, our methods are conceptually simple, and apply equally well to the spherical case and the case of Ising spins.

Lorenzo Rosset, Martin Weigt, Francesco Zamponi
Accurately annotating and controlling protein function from sequence data remains a major challenge, particularly within homologous families where annotated sequences are scarce and structural variation is minimal. We present a two-stage approach for semi-supervised functional annotation and conditional sequence generation in protein families using representation learning. First, we demonstrate that protein language models, pretrained on large and diverse sequence datasets and possibly finetuned via contrastive learning, provide embeddings that robustly capture fine-grained functional specificities, even with limited labeled data. Second, we use the inferred annotations to train a generative probabilistic model, an annotation-aware Restricted Boltzmann Machine, capable of producing synthetic sequences with prescribed functional labels. Across several protein families, we show that this approach achieves highly accurate annotation quality and supports the generation of functionally coherent sequences. Our findings underscore the power of combining self-supervised learning with light supervision to overcome data scarcity in protein function prediction and design.

[*Fourier Plane Tomographic Spectroscopy Reveals Orientation-Dependent Multipolar Plasmon Modes in Micrometer-Scale Janus Particles*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15760 "Fourier Plane Tomographic Spectroscopy Reveals Orientation-Dependent Multipolar Plasmon Modes in Micrometer-Scale Janus Particles")
Felix H. Patzschke, Frank Cichos
Plasmonic Janus particles, comprising dielectric cores with thin metallic caps, exhibit complex optical properties due to their asymmetric structure. Despite applications in active matter research, their orientation-dependent scattering properties remain largely unexplored. We introduce Fourier plane tomographic spectroscopy for simultaneous four-dimensional characterization of scattering from individual micrometer-scale particles across wavelength, incident angle, scattering angle, and polarization. Combining measurements with finite-element simulations, we identify discrete spectral markers in visible and near-infrared regions that evolve predictably with cap orientation. Spherical-harmonics decomposition reveals these markers arise from three distinct multipolar modes up to fifth order: axial-propagating transverse-electric, transverse-propagating transverse-electric, and transverse-propagating axial-electric, with retardation-induced splitting. We observe progressive red-shifts and linewidth narrowing of higher-order resonances, demonstrating curvature's influence on mode dispersion. Orientation-specific scattering patterns exhibit polarization-dependent features enabling optical tracking of particle rotation. Our framework applies to diverse material combinations and geometries, offering a toolkit for designing orientation-responsive nanoantennas, reconfigurable metasurfaces, and active colloidal systems with tailored light-matter interactions.

Alexey Litvinov, Pavel Meshcheriakov, Egor Shestopalov
We study the two-particle approximation of the Ising Field Theory (IFT), formulated in terms of the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation. Derived by Fonseca and Zamolodchikov as a systematic realization of the McCoy-Wu approach, this equation captures confinement by modeling ``mesons'' as bound states of two Majorana fermions (``quarks''), in a way analogous to the integral equation in the 't Hooft model. Despite its approximate nature, the BS equation provides remarkably accurate predictions for the mass spectrum of stable mesons across a wide range of parameters. Motivated by the striking structural similarity between the BS equation in IFT and the 't Hooft equation in two-dimensional QCD, we develop a new non-perturbative analytical framework inspired by the method of Fateev, Lukyanov, and Zamolodchikov (FLZ). Within this approach, we compute spectral sums and systematically derive the large-$n$ WKB expansion for the Bethe-Salpeter equation, which governs the spectrum of an infinite tower of mesons. We further examine how our analytical results capture the known behavior of the spectrum in well-studied asymptotic regimes, such as the $E_8$ limit and the free-fermion point, where exact solutions are available for comparison. Finally, we discuss how the obtained spectral data admit a natural analytic continuation to complex values of the parameters -- an extension that was one of the primary motivations for this work.

Iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs) play a wide variety of roles in biochemical processes that are common to all domains of life on earth. The hyperfine structure of reactive ligands of these clusters can be studied experimentally and theoretically by means of hyperfine spectroscopy, which can reveal catalytic intermediates in these biochemical processes. Their theoretical prediction, however, requires either advanced methods that describe strongly correlated systems, or Hamiltonian modeling based on symmetry-broken electronic structure methods. This work shows how the addition of electron-transfer interactions to the Heisenberg-Dirac-van Vleck Hamiltonian model leads to the quantitative explanation of hyperfine coupling constants at active organic ligand sites. Comparison with experimentally available results confirms our extended approach has the potential to be used in calculations aimed at describing cutting-edge systems.

[139]. [*Thermodynamic nature of irreversibility in active matter*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03625 "Thermodynamic nature of irreversibility in active matter")
Lennart Dabelow, Ralf Eichhorn
Active matter describes systems whose constituents convert energy from their surroundings into directed motion, such as bacteria or catalytic colloids. We establish a thermodynamic law for dilute suspensions of interacting active particles in the form of a remarkable direct link between their dynamics and thermodynamics: The rate at which irreversibility is built up in the non-equilibrium steady state is a state function of the thermodynamic system parameters, namely the number of particles, the temperature and, as a distinctive characteristic of active matter, the swim pressure. Like in the famous fluctuation theorems of stochastic thermodynamics, irreversibility is a dynamical measure that quantifies the amount by which microscopic particle trajectories break time-reversal symmetry, without reference to the typically unobservable processes underlying self-propulsion. We derive the result for the paradigmatic model of active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles with short-ranged repulsive interactions. Based on numerical simulations and heuristic arguments, we furthermore present a refined relation whose validity extends from the dilute into the phase-separated (MIPS) regime.

Jacques K. Desmarais
Recently a generalization of the ``\textit{modern theory of orbital magnetization}'' to include non-local Hamiltonians (e.g. hybrid functionals of the generalized Kohn-Sham theory) was provided for magnetic response properties. Results indicated inequivalence between sampling of direct and reciprocal spaces for those calculations far from the complete basis set limit. We show that this can be explained by a hidden ``relaxation'' contribution to the reciprocal-space derivatives. The missing relaxation term is shown to (generally) affect the results of calculations of not only magnetic, but also electric response properties, within the context of the ``\textit{modern theory of polarization}''. Necessary conditions are provided to permit avoiding the calculation of the hidden relaxation term.

Yuqiang Gao, Menno Bokdam, Paul J. Kelly
We add the magnetic degrees of freedom to the widely used Gaussian Approximation Potential of machine learning (ML) and present a model that describes the potential energy surface of a crystal based on the atomic coordinates as well as their noncollinear magnetic moments. Assuming an adiabatic approximation for the spin directions and magnitudes, the ML model depends solely on spin coordinates and orientation, resulting in computational efffciency and enabling ab initio spin dynamics. Leveraging rotational symmetries of magnetic interactions, the ML model can incorporate various magnetic interactions, expanding into two-body, three-body terms, etc., following the spirit of cluster expansion. For simplicity, we implement the ML model with a two-body form for the exchange interaction. Comparing total energies and local fields predicted by the model for noncollinear spin arrangements with explicit results of constrained noncollinear density functional calculations for bcc Fe yields excellent results, within 1 meV/spin for the total energy. Further optimization, including three-body and other terms, is expected to encompass diverse magnetic interactions and enhance the model's accuracy. This will extend the model's applicability to a wide range of materials and facilitate the machine learning ab initio spin dynamics.

Zhi Zeng, Yin-Kai Yu, Zhi-Xuan Li, Zi-Xiang Li, Shuai Yin
The conventional Kibble-Zurek mechanism and the finite-time scaling provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics from gapped initial states based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario. Here we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the quantum critical point triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order parameter bosons. We find that despite the existence of the gapless initial phase, the driven dynamics can still be captured by the finite-time scaling form. This leads us to propose a criterion for the validity of Kibble-Zurek mechanism with a gapless initial state. Accordingly, our results generalize the Kibble-Zurek theory to incorporate composite fluctuations and relax its requirement for a gapped initial state to systems accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitations. Our work not only brings fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides an approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.

Brindaban Ojha, Shaktiranjan Mohanty, Bhuvneshwari Sharma, Subhankar Bedanta
Electron transport combined with magnetism has gained more attention to the spintronics community in the last few decades. Among them, the topological Hall effect (THE), which arises due to the emergent magnetic field of a non-trivial object, is found to be a promising tool for probing the presence of skyrmions. A sizeable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interfacial interaction (iDMI) with reduced effective anisotropy can stabilize skyrmions in thin films. Recently, a large iDMI has been predicted in Pt/Co/Re thin film. Here, we investigate the influence of various magnetic interactions on the THE in perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/X (X = Ta, Re) thin films. The presence of skyrmions is confirmed via THE and magnetic force microscope (MFM) imaging. Notably, two distinct types of THE signals are observed in the different samples, which are explained using micromagnetic simulations. Our results reveal that exchange interaction, iDMI, effective anisotropy, and saturation magnetization contribute significantly in determining the variations in topological Hall resistivity behavior, which arise from different skyrmionic phases. These findings contribute to the development of novel material systems featuring different skyrmionic phases with potential applications in spintronics.

Rintaro Masaoka, Tomohiro Soejima, Haruki Watanabe
This work rigorously establishes a universal lower bound $z\ge2$ for the dynamical exponent in frustration-free quantum many-body systems whose ground states exhibit power-law decaying correlations. The derivation relies on the Gosset-Huang inequality, providing a unified framework applicable across various lattice structures and spatial dimensions, independent of specific boundary conditions. Remarkably, our result can be applied to prove new bounds for dynamics of classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we utilize a well-established mapping from the time evolution of local Markov processes with detailed balance to that of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians, known as Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians. This proves $z \ge 2$ for such Markov processes, which is an improvement over existing bounds. Beyond these applications, the quantum analysis of the $z\ge2$ bound is further broadened to include systems exhibiting hidden correlations, which may not be evident from purely local operators.

L. Dal Fabbro, H. Holuigue, M. Chighizola, A. Podest\`a
In this work, we have validated the application of Hertzian contact mechanics models and corrections for the analysis of force vs indentation curves, acquired using spherical indenters on linearly elastic samples, by means of finite elements simulations and AFM nanomechanical measurements of polyacrylamide gels possessing a thickness gradient. We have systematically investigated the impact of both large indentations and vertical spatial confinement (bottom effect) on the accuracy of the nanomechanical analysis performed with the Hertz model for the parabolic indenter compared to the Sneddon model for the spherical indenter. We demonstrated the accuracy of the combined correction of large indentation and bottom effects for the Hertz model proposed in the literature in the framework of linearized force vs indentation curves acquired using spherical indenters, as well as a validation of a new linearized form of the Sneddon model. Our results show that the corrected Hertz model allows to accurately quantify the Young's modulus of elasticity of linearly elastic samples with variable thickness at arbitrarily large indentations.

Sven Bjarke Gudnason, Yuki Amari, Muneto Nitta
We study the capture of a magnetic Skyrmion into a domain wall (DW) structure in chiral magnets and find that in the respective ground states of the DW and the Skyrmion, they repel each other. This means that an isolated magnetic Skyrmion cannot a priori enter the DW and become a DW-Skyrmion. However, rotating the DW's phase away from the stable phase may cause the successful capture and hence creation of a stable bound state of a magnetic Skyrmion and a DW: the DW-Skyrmion. At certain distances, the DW may also destroy the magnetic Skyrmion by inducing shrinkage of the latter. This happens as the isolated magnetic Skyrmion has negative DMI energy, whereas the DW-Skyrmion has positive DMI energy; in a finite range from the DW, the magnetic Skyrmion can be pushed to have vanishing DMI energy, for which it collapses to a point. En passant, we find the possibility of pair creation of a Skyrmion anti-DW-Skyrmion pair and a creation of more than one DW-Skyrmions by a Kibble-like mechanism.

Joshuah T. Heath, Rufus Boyack
We study linear scaling relations in electron-phonon superconductors. By combining numerical and analytical techniques, we find linear Homes scaling relations between the zero-temperature superfluid density and the normal-state dc conductivity. This phenomenon arises via either a large impurity scattering rate or inelastic scattering of electrons and Einstein phonons at large electron-phonon coupling. Thus, our Letter shows that Homes scaling is more universal than either cuprate or BCS-like physics and is, instead, a fundamental result in a wide class of superconductors.

The identification of quantum spin liquid phases in Kitaev candidate materials remains a major experimental challenge. Since most Kitaev candidates develop antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at low temperatures, currently there are great interest on the field-induced magnetic disordered phase in these compounds, that are distinct from (partially) polarized states. Recently, a cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has emerged as a promising Kitaev candidate with high-spin $t^{5}_{2g}e^2_g$ configuration and spin-orbit entangled $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ honeycomb lattice system. There are intensive studies on field-induced magnetic states and phase transitions under in-plane magnetic fields. In this study, we identify an intermediate disordered phase induced by an out-of-plane field along the $c$-axis, through high-field magnetization and magnetocaloric effect measurements. To explain the high-field behavior of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, we develop an effective $K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma^{\prime}$ spin model featuring a dominant AFM Kitaev interaction. This framework uncovers an intermediate quantum spin liquid phase, establishing the material as a unique platform for exploring Kitaev physics and field-induced quantum-disordered states.

[149]. [*Impurity states in altermagnetic superconductors*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01008 "Impurity states in altermagnetic superconductors")
Andrea Maiani, Rub\'en Seoane Souto
Altermagnetic superconductors offer the possibility of exploring unconventional superconductivity, including topological states and finite-momentum superconductivity, with promising applications in spintronics and quantum information. However, a direct experimental confirmation of their existence remains elusive. In this work, we propose non-magnetic impurities as probes of the interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity. These impurities induce spin-polarized subgap states whose spatial extension reflects the magnetic order of the substrate material. Depending on whether or not the impurity respects the bulk symmetries, these states form spin-degenerate or spin-split doublets. An external magnetic field aligned with the N\'eel vector can further control the doublet splitting. We further demonstrate that coupling between impurity states leads to a position-dependent, spin-sensitive hybridization, enabling another approach for \textit{in situ} control of atomic-size quantum devices. These findings provide unambiguous experimental signatures of altermagnetic superconductivity accessible via local measurements such as scanning tunneling microscopy and open unexplored pathways for designing tunable quantum devices.

Gautam Nambiar, Andrey Grankin, Mohammad Hafezi
In the past couple of decades, there have been significant advances in measuring quantum properties of light, such as quadratures of squeezed light and single-photon counting. Here, we explore whether such tools can be leveraged to probe electronic correlations in the many-body quantum regime. Specifically, we show that it is possible to probe certain spin, charge, and topological orders in an electronic system by measuring the correlation functions of scattered photons. We construct a mapping from the correlators of the scattered photons to those of a correlated insulator, particularly for Mott insulators described by a single-band Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling. We show that frequency filtering before photodetection plays a crucial role in determining this mapping. We find that if the ground state of the insulator is a gapped spin liquid, a photon-pair correlation function, i.e., $G^{(2)}$, can detect the presence of anyonic excitations with fractional mutual statistics. Moreover, we show that correlations between electromagnetic quadratures can be used to detect expectation values of static spin chirality operators on both the kagome and triangular lattices, thus being useful in detecting chiral spin liquids. More generally, we show that a series of hitherto unmeasured spin-spin and spin-charge correlation functions of the material can be extracted from photonic correlations. This work opens up access to probe correlated materials, beyond the linear response paradigm, by detecting quantum properties of scattered light.

Rhombik Roy, Sunayana Dutta, Ofir E. Alon
The ground state properties of strongly rotating bosons confined in an asymmetric anharmonic potential exhibit a split density distribution. However, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of this split structure remain largely unexplored. Given that rotation is responsible for the breakup of the bosonic cloud, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics by abruptly changing the rotation frequency. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of trapped Bose-Einstein condensates in both symmetric and asymmetric anharmonic potentials under different rotation quench scenarios. In the rotationally symmetric trap, angular momentum is a good quantum number. This makes it challenging to exchange angular momentum within the system; hence, a rotation quench does practically not impact the density distribution. In contrast, the absence of angular momentum conservation in asymmetric traps results in more complex dynamics. This allows rotation quenches to either inject into or extract angular momentum from the system. We observe and analyze these intricate dynamics both for the mean-field condensed and the many-body fragmented systems. The dynamical evolution of the condensed system and the fragmented system exhibits similarities in several observables during small rotation quenches. However, these similarities diverge notably for larger quenches. Additionally, we investigate the formation and the impact of the vortices on the angular momentum dynamics of the evolving split density. All in all, our findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of trapped interacting bosons under different rotation quenches.

Noble Gluscevich, J. A. Sauls
In equilibrium, confined films of superfluid $^3$He-A have the chiral axis, $\hat{\ell}$, locked normal to the surface of the film. There are two degenerate ground states $\hat{\ell}\;||\pm\hat{z}$. However, for a temperature quench, i.e. cool down through the phase transition at a finite rate, causally disconnected regions of order parameter fluctuations develop and evolve into an inhomogeneous ordered phase that hosts both domain walls between time-reversed chiral phases as well as vortices with winding numbers $p\in\mathbb{Z}$. We present simulations based on a time-dependent generalization of Ginzburg-Landau theory for strong-coupling $^3$He that reveal both types of topological defects to be present following the temperature quench. Results for the dynamics of vortices interacting with anti-vortices as well as domain walls are presented. The vortex number density as a function of quench rate agrees well with the scaling predicted by Kibble and Zurek. We also present results for the number distribution and compare with other theoretical models for full counting statistics of the topological defect density. Finally, we present results for an asymmetry in the post-freeze-out populations of inequivalent vortex core structures that are characteristic of a chiral superfluid.

E. V. Stolyarov, V. L. Andriichuk, Andrii M. Sokolov
We consider a coupling element based on a symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and show that it mediates a two-photon interaction. This and other inductive interactions due to the SQUID can be switched off in situ. We derive the system Hamiltonian for coupled resonator and rf SQUID. The rf SQUID dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of energy states and acts as an artificial atom. We discuss how the Josephson symmetry breaks owing to magnetic fields in the superconducting loops. We assess that the two-photon coupling strength reaches 18 MHz which can exceed the single-photon capacitive interaction in the coupler.

Jiayin Gu, Fan Zhang
The current fluctuation in one-dimensional driven transport systems is conjectured to have an upper bound determined by its mean value together with the driving force. The resulting inequality arises from repulsive interactions between the transporting particles, and the bound is approached in near-equilibrium systems or far-from-equilibrium systems with weak interactions between the transporting particles. First, a coarse-grained model for one-dimensional transport systems is proposed. This model describes random particle exchanges between two reservoirs with constant rates, and the upper bound is identified from this model. Then, the inequality is rigorously proved in quantum ballistic transport systems. In addition, two specific diffusive systems are used to demonstrate the validity of the inequality. One is the exclusion process for which the inequality is proven. The other is the transport of charged particles. For this system, the inequality is numerically supported.

Benjamin Michen, Tim Pokart, Jan Carl Budich
We construct a protocol to adiabatically prepare the ground state of a widely discussed number-conserving model Hamiltonian for ultracold atoms in optical lattices that supports Majorana edge states. In particular, we introduce a symmetry breaking mass term that amounts to threading a commensurate (artificial) magnetic flux through the plaquettes of the considered two-leg ladder which opens a constant bulk gap. This enables the preparation of the topological Majorana phase from a trivial Mott insulator state with optimal asymptotic scaling of the ramp time in system size, which is linear owing to the critical nature of the target state. Using constructive bosonization techniques that account for both finite size effects and global fermion number conservation, we are able to fully explain with theory the somewhat counterintuitive necessity of the aforementioned commensurate flux for a controlled bulk gap. Our analytical predictions are corroborated and quantified by unbiased numerical matrix product states (MPS) simulations. Directly building up on previous experimental work, the crucial flux-term of the proposed protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques in atomic quantum simulators.

Mathieu Dedenon, Carles Blanch-Mercader, Karsten Kruse, Jens Elgeti
We propose an agent-based model of active flexible rods. Inspired by cytoskeletal flows, we introduce activity by an internal flow that contributes to the dissipative forces. The active force between our agents is central and reciprocal, ensuring linear and angular momentum conservation. For nematic activity, we find spontaneous, thresholdless flows and stochastic flow-reorientation, which is accompanied by the formation of topological defects. Defects appear and vanish with activity-dependent rates, and $+1/2$-defects self-propel. These hallmarks of active turbulence are present even on the scale of individual agents. The particle-based interactions lead to an emergent coupling between density and orientation that generates density dipoles around $+1/2$-defects. Finally, we highlight the versatility of our agent-based model by presenting spontaneous flows in three dimensions and tissue growth. Our framework opens the way for an integrated description of living materials, including several forms of activity in the same system.

Wenhua Zhao, Ling-Na Wu, Francesco Petiziol, Andr\'e Eckardt
We discuss the preparation of topological insulator states with fermionic ultracold atoms in optical lattices by means of measurement-based Markovian feedback control. The designed measurement and feedback operators induce an effective dissipative channel that stabilizes the desired insulator state, either in an exact way or approximately in the case where additional experimental constraints are assumed. Successful state preparation is demonstrated in one-dimensional insulators as well as for Haldane's Chern insulator, by calculating the fidelity between the target ground state and the steady state of the feedback-modified master equation. The fidelity is obtained numerically through exact diagonalization or via time evolution of the system with moderate sizes. For larger 2D systems, we compare the mean occupation of the single-particle eigenstates for the ground and steady state computed through mean-field kinetic equations.

Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE-resistant alloys.

Benshu Fan, Umberto De Giovannini, Hannes H\"ubener, Shuyun Zhou, Wenhui Duan, Angel Rubio, Peizhe Tang
Optical selection rules endorsed by symmetry are crucial for understanding the optical properties of quantum materials and the associated ultrafast spectral phenomena. Here, we introduce momentum-resolved Floquet optical selection rules using group theory to elucidate the pump-probe photoemission spectral distributions of monolayer black phosphorus (BP), which are governed by the symmetries of both the material and the lasers. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we further investigate the dynamical evolution of Floquet(-Volkov) states in the photoemission spectra of monolayer BP, revealing their spectral weights at specific momenta for each sideband. These observations are comprehensively explained by the proposed Floquet optical selection rules. Our framework not only clarifies experimental photoemission spectra but also uncovers unexplored characteristics under different pump-probe configurations. Our results are expected to deepen the understanding of light-induced ultrafast spectra in BP and can be extended to other Floquet systems.

G. D. Zhao, F. Yang, L. Q. Chen
The collective amplitude mode of the order parameter in displacive ferroelectrics, termed the ferron, represents the amplitude fluctuations of long-range ordered polarization. At temperatures well below phase transition temperature $T_c$, the energy of ferron excitation is significantly gapped in the long-wavelength limit. As $T_c$ is approached, this gap softens dramatically to minimal or gapless values, thereby should lead to a substantial contribution to thermal properties. In this context, we explore the role of ferrons in heat capacity and thermal transport by incorporating a microscopic self-consistent phase-transition theory for displacive ferroelectricity in contrast to the conventional treatment of attributing thermal properties solely to acoustic phonons. Using ferroelectric $\rm{PbTiO}_{3}$ as a case study, we show that the softening of ferrons near the phase transition is essential to accurately capturing the experimental temperature and electric-field dependencies of thermal properties.

Michael Sonner, Valentin Link, Dmitry A. Abanin
We introduce a framework for describing the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity models out of equilibrium which is based on the influence matrix approach. By replacing the dynamical map of a large fermionic quantum environment with an effective semi-group influence matrix (SGIM) which acts on a reduced auxiliary space, we overcome the limitations of previous proposals, achieving high accuracy at long evolution times. This SGIM corresponds to a uniform matrix-product state representation of the influence matrix and can be obtained by an efficient algorithm presented in this paper. We benchmark this approach by computing the spectral function of the single impurity Anderson model with high resolution. Further, the spectrum of the effective dynamical map allows us to obtain relaxation rates of the impurity towards equilibrium following a quantum quench. Finally, for a quantum impurity model with on-site two-fermion loss, we compute the spectral function and confirm the emergence of Kondo physics at large loss rates.

Tomohiro Hattori, Hirotaka Irie, Tadashi Kadowaki, Shu Tanaka
Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.

We show that a spinor traveling along a helical path develops a spin-orbit coupling because of the curvature of the path. We then estimate the magnitude of this effective geometric spin-orbit interaction for structures that showcase chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that this chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling ($\chi$-SOC), in conjunction with broken time-reversal symmetry, may be an important ingredient for the microscopic underpinning of the CISS phenomenon.

We study the frequency-resolved density response of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to a bath of dye molecules by time-periodic driving. By monitoring the photon number dynamics for different drive frequencies, we obtain the spectral response of the condensate in a phase-sensitive way. We find that as the photon number increases, the response of the coupled condensate-bath system transitions from overdamped to resonant behavior, indicating a transition from closed to open system dynamics. Our spectroscopy method paves the way for studies of collective excitations in complex driven-dissipative systems.

Jia-Jia Luo, Sagarika Basak, Han Pu, Xi-Wen Guan
The Drude weight (DW) is an essential quantity that characterizes the quantum transport properties of many-body systems. However, a rigorous understanding and exact computation of DWs, particularly for strongly correlated systems with doping, still remain elusive.
  In this Letter, taking advantage of the quantum integrability, we calculate exactly the DWs and Seebeck effect (SE) for generic filling factor in one-dimensional (1D) Fermi-Hubbard model with arbitrary interaction strengths and magnetic fields. We build up its intrinsic connection to the Luttinger parameters, and derive universal scaling laws for DWs across phase transitions. Our results provide a deep understanding of mutual influences in transport between the spin and the charge degrees of freedom, showing a counterintuitive subtle spin-charge coupling effect and uncovering the microscopic origin of the (spin) Seebeck effects in thermal conductivity. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol to measure the DWs in ultracold atomic systems.

Optically active spin defects in solids are promising platforms for quantum technologies. Here, we present a first-principles framework to investigate intersystem crossing processes, which represent crucial steps in the optical spin-polarization cycle used to address spin defects. Considering the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a case study, we demonstrate that our framework effectively captures electron correlation effects in the calculation of many-body electronic states and their spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, while systematically addressing finite-size effects. We validate our predictions by carrying out measurements of fluorescence lifetimes, finding excellent agreement between theory and experiments. The framework presented here provides a versatile and robust tool for exploring the optical cycle of varied spin defects entirely from first principles.

Sahand Seifnashri, Shu-Heng Shao, Xinping Yang
We provide a general prescription for gauging finite non-invertible symmetries in 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian systems. Our primary example is the Rep(D$_8$) fusion category generated by the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation, which is the simplest anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry on a spin chain of qubits. We explicitly compute its lattice F-symbols and illustrate our prescription for a particular (non-maximal) gauging of this symmetry. In our gauging procedure, we introduce two qubits around each link, playing the role of "gauge fields" for the non-invertible symmetry, and impose novel Gauss's laws. Similar to the Kramers-Wannier transformation for gauging an ordinary $\mathbb{Z}_2$, our gauging can be summarized by a gauging map, which is part of a larger, continuous non-invertible cosine symmetry.

Nirmalya Jana, Atasi Chakraborty, Anamitra Mukherjee, Amit Agarwal
Metallic antiferromagnets are essential for efficient spintronic applications due to their fast switching and high mobility, yet room-temperature metallic antiferromagnets are rare. Here, we investigate YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$, a room temperature antiferromagnet, and establish it as an exfoliable layered metal with altermagnetic surface states. Using multi-orbital Hubbard model calculations, we reveal that its robust metallic AFM ordering is stabilized by electronic correlations and a partially nested Fermi surface. Furthermore, we show that YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological Dirac crossings, connecting unique even-order spin-polarized surface states with parabolic and inverted Mexican-hat-like dispersion. Our findings position YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring the interplay of correlation, topology, and surface altermagnetism of layered antiferromagnets.

Benjamin Geisler, James J. Hamlin, Gregory R. Stewart, Richard G. Hennig, P. J. Hirschfeld
Motivated by the recent observation of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c \sim 40$ K in La3Ni2O7 on SrLaAlO4(001) (SLAO), we explore the structural and electronic properties as well as the spin-spin correlation function of this bilayer nickelate system by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states around the $\Gamma$ point, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations due to Fermi surface nesting of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states near the interface. These results provide insights into the emergence of superconductivity in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, suggest a possible key role of the interface, and highlight fundamental differences from the hydrostatic pressure scenario.

We perform a high-throughput computational search for novel phonon-mediated superconductors, starting from the Materials Cloud 3-dimensional structure database of experimentally known inorganic stoichiometric compounds. We first compute the Allen-Dynes critical temperature (T$_c$) for 4533 non-magnetic metals using a direct and progressively finer sampling of the electron-phonon couplings. For the candidates with the largest T$_c$, we use automated Wannierizations and electron-phonon interpolations to obtain a high-quality dataset for the most promising 250 dynamically stable structures, for which we calculate spectral functions, superconducting bandgaps, and isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg critical temperatures. For 140 of these, we also provide anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting gaps and critical temperatures. The approach is remarkably successful in finding known superconductors, and we find 24 unknown ones with a predicted anisotropic T$_{\rm c}$ above 10~K. Among them, we identify a possible double gap superconductor (p-doped BaB$_2$), a non-magnetic half-Heusler ZrRuSb, and the perovskite TaRu$_3$C, all exhibiting significant T$_{\rm c}$. Finally, we introduce a sensitivity analysis to estimate the robustness of the predictions.

Pulsed laser-deposited amorphous carbon nanofoams are potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage applications due to ultra-light weight, large volumetric void fractions, and co-existence of sp, sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridization. It is known that charge storage in carbon nanostructures containing disordered sp2-domains is determined by their wettability, surface area, and porosity. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the areal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its wettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance was enhanced by about fifty times and the device voltage increased from 0.8 to 1.1 V compared to as-grown carbon nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the first time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ measurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute this effect, observed but generally not explained in previous works in the literature, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes during the charge storage performance. This optimization of pulsed laser deposited carbon nanofoam may open an avenue for fabricating lightweight and porous nanostructures for advanced macro-to-micro-supercapacitor devices.

Wen-Tao Xu, Michael Knap, Frank Pollmann
Within the confined phase of (2+1)D lattice gauge theories a roughening transition arises between a weakly confined regime with floppy string excitations and a strongly confined regime with stiff string excitations. In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.

Bijay Kumar Sahoo, Abhiram Soori
We study a multi-terminal Josephson junction consisting of a central spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) region with an in-plane Zeeman field connected to four superconducting terminals. This setup allows for the simultaneous measurement of both longitudinal and transverse Josephson currents in response to a phase bias and provides a platform to probe the planar Hall effect in superconducting transport. We find that the system exhibits anomalous Josephson effect (AJE) and Josephson diode effect (JDE) when the symmetry between opposite momentum modes is broken in SOC region. Specifically, breaking the symmetry between $k_x$ and $-k_x$ results in JDE and AJE in the longitudinal Josephson current, while breaking the symmetry between $k_y$ and $-k_y$ leads to a finite transverse Josephson current that also exhibits JDE and AJE. Transverse Josephson diode effect coefficient attains values as large as $500\%$ for realistic set of parameters. Furthermore, for specific parameter choices, the current-phase relation in the transverse direction supports unidirectional transport, highlighting its potential for superconducting circuit applications. Our setup offers a new route to engineering nonreciprocal superconducting transport.

The fields of mechanobiology and biomechanics are expanding our understanding of the complex behavior of soft biological tissues across multiple scales. Given the intricate connection between tissue microstructure and its macroscale mechanical behavior, unraveling this mechanistic relationship remains an ongoing challenge. Reconstituted fiber networks serve as valuable in vitro models to simplify the intricacy of in vivo systems for targeted investigations. Concurrently, advances in imaging enable microstructure visualization and, through generative pipelines, modeling as discrete element networks. These mesoscale models provide insights into macroscale tissue behavior. However, there is still no clear way to systematically incorporate experimentally observed microstructural changes into in silico models of biological networks. In this work, we develop a novel framework to generate topologically-driven discrete fiber networks using high-resolution images that account for how environmental changes during polymerization influence the resulting structure. Leveraging these networks, we generate models of interconnected load-bearing fiber components that exhibit softening under compression and are bending-resistant. The generative topology framework enables control over network-level features, such as fiber volume fraction and cross-link density, along with fiber-level properties, like length distribution, to simulate changes driven by different polymerization conditions. We validate the robustness of our simulations against experimental data in a collagen-specific study case where we examine nonlinear elastic responses of collagen networks across varying conditions. TopoGEN provides a tool for tissue biomechanics and engineering, helping to bridge microstructural insights and bulk mechanical behavior by linking image-derived microstructural topological organization to soft tissue mechanics.

Polar metals, materials that exhibit both electric polarization and high conductivity, can also host topological phases. Because free carriers strongly suppress distortive polar order and change the Fermi level, controlling charge dynamics is crucial for simultaneously tuning ferroelectric and topological phases in the same material. Here, we explore the experimental conditions that enable access to these phases in bismuth-doped Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te epilayers. For samples in the topological phase at $x = 0.5$, we use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to evaluate their complex permittivity as a function of temperature. We observe a non-monotonic variation in carrier concentration with bismuth doping, indicating a change in carrier type. By tracking the transverse optical phonon mode, we identify a ferroelectric phase transition when distortive polar order emerges below a critical temperature that depends on carrier concentration. We show that bismuth doping controls the metallicity-dependent order parameters in the softening and hardening phases. Our work demonstrates a tunable platform for engineering exotic states of matter that integrate metallicity, ferroelectricity and topology.

Polynomial machine learning potentials (MLPs) based on polynomial rotational invariants have been systematically developed for various systems and applied to efficiently predict crystal structures. In this study, we propose a robust methodology founded on polynomial MLPs to comprehensively enumerate crystal structures under high-pressure conditions and to evaluate their phase stability at finite temperatures. The proposed approach involves constructing polynomial MLPs with high predictive accuracy across a broad range of pressures, conducting reliable global structure searches, and performing exhaustive self-consistent phonon calculations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by examining elemental silicon at pressures up to 100 GPa and temperatures up to 1000 K, revealing stable phases across these conditions. The framework established in this study offers a powerful strategy for predicting crystal structures and phase stability under high-pressure and finite-temperature conditions.

Spatially indirect excitons in semiconductor quantum wells are relevant to basic research and device applications because they exhibit enhanced tunability, delocalized wave functions, and potentially longer lifetimes relative to direct excitons. Here we investigate the properties of indirect excitons and their coupling interactions with direct excitons in asymmetric InGaAs double quantum wells using optical multidimensional coherent spectroscopy and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. Analyses of the spectra confirm a strong influence of many-body effects, and reveal that excited-state zero-quantum coherences between direct and indirect excitons in the quantum wells dephase faster than the much higher-energy single-quantum coherences between excitonic excited states and ground states. The results also suggest an important energy-dependent role of continuum states in mediating system dynamics, and they indicate that dephasing mechanisms are associated with uncorrelated or anticorrelated energy-level fluctuations.

We present a comprehensive study of topological phases in the SO($n$) spin chains using a combination of analytical parton construction and numerical techniques. For even $n=2l$, we identify a novel SPT$^2$ phase characterized by two distinct topological sectors, exhibiting exact degeneracy at the matrix product state (MPS) exactly solvable point. Through Gutzwiller-projected mean-field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we demonstrate that these sectors remain topologically degenerate in close chains throughout the SPT$^2$ phase, with energy gaps decaying exponentially with system size. For odd $n=2l+1$, we show that the ground state remains unique in close chains. We precisely characterize critical states using entanglement entropy scaling, confirming the central charges predicted by conformal field theories. Our results reveal fundamental differences between even and odd $n$ cases, provide numerical verification of topological protection, and establish reliable methods for studying high-symmetry quantum systems. The Gutzwiller-guided DMRG is demonstrated to be notably efficient in targeting specific topological sectors.

[*Practical considerations for crystallographic and microstructure mapping with direct electron detector-based electron backscatter diffraction*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11624 "Practical considerations for crystallographic and microstructure mapping with direct electron detector-based electron backscatter diffraction")
Tianbi Zhang, Ruth Birch, Graeme Francolini, Ebru Karakurt Uluscu, Ben Britton
Compact direct electron detectors are becoming increasingly popular in electron microscopy applications including electron backscatter diffraction, as they offer an opportunity for low cost and accessible microstructural analysis. In this work, we explore how one of these commercial devices based on the Timepix chip can be optimized to obtain high quality data quickly and easily, through careful systematic analysis of a variety of samples, including: semiconductor silicon, commercially pure nickel, a dual phase titanium-molybdenum alloy, and a silicon carbide ceramic matrix composite. Our findings provide strategies for very fast collection of orientation maps, including at low voltage (5-10 keV) and low beam current conditions. Additionally, strategies for collection of very high quality EBSD patterns are demonstrated that have significant potential for advanced EBSD applications (e.g. elastic strain mapping).

Naoto Shiraishi, Mizuki Yamaguchi
We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.grability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.

We highlight recent advances in the controlled creation of single-photon emitters in van der Waals materials and in the understanding of their atomistic origin. We focus on quantum emitters created in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which provide spectrally sharp single-photon emission at cryogenic temperatures, and the ones in insulating hBN, which provide bright and stable single-photon emission up to room temperature. After introducing the different classes of quantum emitters in terms of band-structure properties, we review the defect creation methods based on electron and ion irradiation as well as local strain engineering and plasma treatments. A main focus of the review is put on discussing the microscopic origin of the quantum emitters as revealed by various experimental platforms, including optical and scanning probe methods.

Alex Gower
We show that Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) are prime candidates for use as neuromorphic machine learning processors with Equilibrium Propagation (EP) based on-chip learning. The inherent energy gradient descent dynamics of OIMs, combined with their standard CMOS implementation using existing fabrication processes, provide a natural substrate for EP learning. Our simulations confirm that OIMs satisfy the gradient-descending update property necessary for a scalable Equilibrium Propagation implementation and achieve $\sim 97.2\pm0.1\%$ test accuracy on MNIST and $\sim 88.0\pm0.1\%$ on Fashion-MNIST without requiring any significant hardware modifications. Importantly, OIMs maintain robust performance under realistic hardware constraints, including 10-bit parameter quantization, 4-bit phase measurement precision, and moderate phase noise that can potentially be beneficial with parameter optimization. These results establish OIMs as a promising platform for fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, potentially enabling energy-based learning algorithms that have been previously constrained by computational limitations.

Zhiping Xue, Ji Zou, Chengyuan Cai, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Tao Yu
We address that the stray magnetic field emitted by the excited quantum states of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers is spin-momentum locked, such that the spin transfer to nearby ferromagnetic nanostructures is unidirectional. This may allow the controlled excitation of propagating magnons by NV centers in diamond. A pair of NV spin qubits exchange virtual magnons in a magnetic nanowire in a chiral manner that leads to directional quantum entanglement. A magnon-based ``quantum-entanglement isolator" should be a useful device in future quantum information technology.

F. O. Schumann, M. Paleschke, J. Henk, W. Widdra, C. -T. Chiang
Imaging of magnetic domains with a photoelectron emission microscope operated with photon energies in the threshold regime often suffers from low contrast. In this work we show by symmetry considerations, photoemission calculations, and imaging experiments, how the contrast can be improved significantly. The key to both domain selectivity and sizable intensity asymmetries is, guided by symmetry considerations, selecting the momenta of the photoelectrons by a properly positioned contrast aperture. By comparing computational with experimental results for an Fe(001) surface we prove the feasibility of the approach.

Anthony N. Papathanassiou, Elias Sakellis
Experimental results for a huge number of different materials published during the past fifty years confirm the validity of the Jonscher's Universal Dielectric Response Law. Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Almond - West Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed.

Electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) represent a fundamental cornerstone of condensed matter physics, commanding persistent attention due to their pivotal role in driving novel quantum phenomena within low-dimensional materials. Here, we unveil unusual anisotropic electron-phonon coupling behaviors in quasi-one-dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ nano-flakes through a powerful combination of angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy directly visualize the pronounced quasi-one-dimensional atomic chains within the crystal structure, establishing a structural foundation for the observed anisotropic interactions. Our Raman investigations reveal remarkable polarization-dependent responses in $A_g$ phonon modes that deviate significantly from conventional behavior, which our theoretical analyses attribute to complex anisotropic electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements further uncover an intriguing phonon decay mechanism involving both three- and four-phonon processes, with the latter showing significant contributions in some modes - a possible manifestation of strong anisotropic electron-phonon interactions. Beyond revealing $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ as an exceptional platform for exploring anisotropic EPIs, this work demonstrates that integrating angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy with DFPT calculations offers a powerful methodology for investigating electron-phonon interactions in emerging low-dimensional quantum materials.

Yongjian Wang, A. A. Taskin, Yoichi Ando
Nonlocal transport, which goes beyond the Ohm's law, can be a key in understanding systems with topological order or edge states. Here we report an unusual nonlocal charge transport in the nodal-line semimetal ZrTe$_5$ that occurs in the ultra-quantum limit driven by the magnetic field applied along the $a$-axis. Surprisingly, the observed decay length of the nonlocality exceeds 100 $\mu$m and it increases linearly with the sample width. This nonlocal transport is detected not only in the longitudinal configuration, but also in the transverse one as an unusual nonlocal Hall effect. Our findings demonstrate that the nonlocal response can offer unprecedented insights into topological quantum materials.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is widely studied for numerous applications and is commercially employed in the semiconductor industry, where planar substrates are the norm. However, the inherent ALD feature of coating virtually any surface geometry with atomistic thickness control is equally attractive for coating particulate materials (supports). In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the developments in this decades-old field of ALD on particulate materials, drawing on a bottom-up and quantitative analysis of 799 articles from this field. The obtained dataset is the basis for abstractions regarding reactor types (specifically for particles), coating materials, reactants, supports and processing conditions. Furthermore, the dataset enables direct access to specific processing conditions (for a given material, surface functionality, application etc.) and increases accessibility of the respective literature. We also review fundamental concepts of ALD on particles, and discuss the most common applications, i.e., catalysis (thermo-, electro-, photo-), batteries, luminescent phosphors and healthcare. Finally, we identify historical trends, and provide an outlook on prospective developments.

M. V. Sadovskii
We present a brief review of some recent work on the problem of highest achievable temperature of superconducting transition $T_c$ in electron-phonon systems. The discovery of record-breaking values of $T_c$ in quite a number of hydrides under high pressure was an impressive demonstration of capabilities of electron-phonon mechanism of Cooper pairing. This lead to an increased interest on possible limitations of Eliashberg-McMillan theory as the main theory of superconductivity in a system of electrons and phonons. We shall consider some basic conclusions following from this theory and present some remarks on the limit of very strong electron-phonon coupling. We shall discuss possible limitations on the value of the coupling constant related to possible lattice and specific heat instability and conclude that within the stable metallic phase the effective pairing constant may acquire very large values. We discuss some bounds for $T_c$ derived in the strong coupling limit and propose an elementary estimate of an upper limit for $T_c$, expressed via combination of fundamental physical constants. Finally we also briefly discuss some pessimistic estimates for $T_c$ of metallic hydrogen obtained in ``jellium'' model.

The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.

The anomalous Nernst effect is the thermoelectric counterpart of the anomalous Hall effect, which can emerge in magnetic materials or topological materials without magnetic field. Such effect is critical to both fundamental topological physics and various application fields, including energy harvesting, spintronics and optoelectronics. In this work, we observe the anomalous photo-Nernst effect, which use light excitation to generate temperature gradients for the thermoelectric response. Our experiments reveal a pronounced edge photocurrent response in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 under zero magnetic field, originating from the anomalous photo-Nernst effect. The pronounced photo-Nernst current benefits from the exceptional properties of Co3Sn2S2, including the large thermoelectric coefficient, topologically enhanced anomalous response of Weyl bands and the Shockley-Ramo nature of long-range photocurrent generation. Furthermore, by comparing the nominal anomalous Nernst coefficient under different wavelength excitations, we observe a clear enhancement in the mid-infrared region, originating from the topological contribution from the large Berry curvature of Weyl bands. Our results reveal the interplay among light, magnetism, and topological order in magnetic Weyl semimetals, which not only offers insights for fundamental physics but also advances potential applications in quantum devices.

DFT is vital for materials discovery, materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r$^2$SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r$^2$SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r$^2$SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX uses different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX enhances the r$^2$SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+$U$. The O$_2$ overbinding in r$^2$SCAN (~0.3 eV/O$_2$) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN50, minimizing r$^2$SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r$^2$SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r$^2$SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN, which is 12 to 165x faster than r$^2$SCAN10

We report a scalable and cost-effective method for fabricating high-performance Bragg mirrors using a bottom-up approach that combines evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and dip-coating. The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.

Yu Lei, Peng Wang
Electron matter interactions in electron microscopy produce both elastic and inelastic scattering, forming the basis for imaging and spectroscopy. However, the integration of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with 4D-STEM and electron ptychography remains challenging because of detector geometry conflicts. Song et al. solved this issue by introducing a hollow type pixelated detector that enables hollow ptychography and allows low angle electrons to go through to the EELS spectrometer. The single-slice approach of hollow ptychography proves effective for 2D thin materials but struggles with multiple scattering in thicker specimens. Here, we introduce multislice hollow ptychography (MHP), a robust imaging modality that overcomes these limitations by accounting for multiple scattering. MHP enables high-resolution structural imaging from hollow diffraction patterns while remaining compatible with simultaneous EELS acquisition. It potentially can provide sub-angstrom lateral resolution at intermediate doses and supports full 3D atomic-layer reconstruction at ultrahigh doses, with up to 70% of total electrons available for spectroscopy. This flexible framework facilitates correlative 3D imaging and chemical mapping in complex materials, including interfaces, defects, and dopants.

Andreas Hadjipaschalis, Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Jennifer Cano
Altermagnetism provides new routes to realize Majorana zero modes with vanishing net magnetization. We consider a recently proposed heterostructure consisting of a semiconducting wire on top of an altermagnet and with proximity-induced superconductivity. We demonstrate that rotating the wire serves as a tuning knob to induce the topological phase. For $d$-, $g$- and $i$-wave altermagnetic pairing, we derive angle-dependent topological gap-closing conditions. We derive symmetry constraints on angles where the induced altermagnetism must vanish, which we verify by explicit models. Our results imply that a bent or curved wire realizes a spatially-dependent topological invariant with Majorana zero modes pinned to positions where the topological invariant changes. This provides a new experimental set-up whereby a single wire can host both topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes without $in$ $situ$ tuning.

Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Seung-Cheol Lee
The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians, we obtain analytic phase boundaries and logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. In this work, we utilize the context-field lens, which provides physics-grounded interpretability and motivates the development of novel generative models bridging theoretical condensed matter physics and artificial intelligence.

Hemant Kumar, Praveen Kumar, Dierk Raabe, Baptiste Gault, Surendra Kumar Makineni
Lightweight, high-strength structural materials are component enablers in transportation and aerospace, improving carbon footprint and fuel efficiency. Aluminium (Al)-based eutectics have property combinations that qualify them for such applications. However, they are prone to catastrophic failure because of insufficient load transfer across the interfaces between the brittle eutectic phase and the ductile matrix. Here we present a general solution to this problem by engineering these interfaces at the atomic scale, equipping them with excellent load transfer capabilities, thus qualifying such composites for lightweight structural applications. We demonstrate the approach by adding Zr to an Al-Gd-based hypoeutectic alloy, promoting the formation of a coherent Interfacial-Ordered-Phase (IOP) around the brittle Al3Gd eutectic phase and nanosized core-shell ordered precipitates in the primary Al matrix. This enables a 400% increase in tensile plasticity while retaining a high tensile strength of 295 MPa at room temperature and 130 MPa at 250C. This exceptional increase in formability is attributed to the ability of the IOP layer to prevent dislocations from accumulating at the weak fibre/matrix interfaces, avoiding stress concentrations that would otherwise initiate fibre breakage and debonding. The core-shell precipitates in Al cause a large number of dislocation cross/multiple-slips on different {111} planes, forming ultra-fine (10 nm) dislocation networks that leverage substantial plastic strain accumulation. The approach shows how atomic interface design overcomes the ductility limitations of lightweight high-strength ductile eutectic alloys for structural applications.

Stephen Zhang, Danrui Ni, Ruyi Ke, Guangming Cheng, Nan Yao, Robert J. Cava
Superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ has been reported to emerge upon suppression of intertwined spin and charge density wave (SDW/CDW) order, suggesting a possible connection to the pairing mechanism. Here we report a systematic investigation of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3-x}$Cu$_{x}$O$_{10+\delta}$ ($0 \leq x \leq 0.7$), focusing on the evolution of the SDW/CDW order as a function of chemical substitution. Temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and Hall effect measurements reveal a linear suppression of density wave transition temperature $T{\text{dw}}$ and a concurrent enhancement of hole concentration with increasing Cu content. At higher substitution levels ($x > 0.15$), the transition-induced anomaly in the resistivity becomes undetectable while a magnetic signature persists, indicating a partial decoupling of spin and charge components and the possible survival of short-range spin correlations. The absence of superconductivity across the substitution series highlights the importance of additional factors in stabilizing the superconducting state in pressurized La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$.

Nader Mostaan, Nathan Goldman, Ata\c{c} \.Imamo\u{g}lu, Fabian Grusdt
The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.

Chi-Lun Lee, Yu-Syuan Lin, Pik-Yin Lai
We consider the finite-timestep Brownian dynamics of a single particle confined in one dimension, with a nonuniform temperature profile. In such an open-boundary scenario, one cannot observe any net probability current in the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). On the other hand, the nonequilibrium nature of this system is exhibited through the asymmetry in forward and backward transition probabilities, as is reported in this work through the stochastic simulation analysis and theoretical arguments. The irreversibility becomes prominent nearby the temperature interface. We propose that the observed irreversibility can be accounted for via a virtual-gyration scenario, while the collapse of virtual gyrations upon the one-dimensional coordinate leads to the absence of probability current.

Eugene B. Kolomeisky, Mia Kyler, Ishaan U. Patel
Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis of an $s$-wave superconductor, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth.

Arafat Rahman, Alamgir Kabir, Tareq Mahmud
The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and non trivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis predicts a superconducting transition temperature $T_c \approx 14$ K at ambient pressure, which is the highest value reported so far among cubic semimetallic superconductors. When subjected to a pressure of 15 GPa, $T_c$ increases further to 18 K. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.

Honeycomb bismuthene structures on Ag(111) were investigated using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and density functional theory. LEED I(V) analysis revealed that 0.5 monolayer (ML) of Bi forms an ultraflat honeycomb lattice with negligible buckling at ~120 K, which transforms into other structures upon warming to room temperature. A similar flat bismuthene structure also forms in Mn/Bi/Ag(111), which remains stable even at room temperature. Mn deposition on $(p\times \sqrt{3})$-rect Bi/Ag(111) induces Bi surface segregation, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, resulting in a p$(2\times2)$ honeycomb bismuthene. The detailed structural investigation provides fundamental insights into the characterization of two-dimensional topological properties of bismuthene grown on Ag(111).

Andreas Almqvist, Bo N. J. Persson
Understanding contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We test Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory for elastoplastic solids, assuming a constant penetration hardness. Using a numerical model based on the boundary element method, we simulate the contact between a flat rigid surface and an elastic-perfectly plastic half-space with a randomly rough surface. The theory's predictions for elastic, plastic, and total contact area agree quantitatively with the numerical results. The simulations also support the boundary conditions assumed in the theory, namely that the stress probability vanishes at both zero and yield stress. These findings reinforce the validity of the theory for systems with constant hardness.

Yuki Sato, Tomo Tanaka
We reconsider the criticality of the Ising model on two-dimensional dynamical triangulations based on the $N \times N$ hermitian two-matrix model with the introduction of a loop-counting parameter and linear terms in the potential. We show that in the large-N limit even though the Ising model is classical, the critical temperature can reach absolute zero by tuning the loop-counting parameter, and the corresponding continuum theory turns out to be the quantised theory of neither pure gravity nor gravity coupled to conformal matter with central charge being 1/2.

Jan Ambj{\o}rn, Yuki Sato, Tomo Tanaka
We study the zero-temperature criticality of the Ising model on two-dimensional dynamical triangulations to contemplate its physics. As it turns out, an inhomogeneous nature of the system yields an interesting phase diagram and the physics at the zero temperature is quite sensitive about how we cool down the system. We show the existence of a continuous parameter that characterizes the way we approach the zero-temperature critical point and it may enter in a critical exponent.

[207]. [*A subexponential version of Cramer's theorem*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05791 "A subexponential version of Cramer's theorem")
Gr\'egoire Ferr\'e
We consider the large deviations associated with the empirical mean of independent and identically distributed random variables under a subexponential moment condition. We show that non-trivial deviations are observable at a subexponential scale in the number of variables, and we provide the associated rate function, which is non-convex and is not derived from a Legendre-Fenchel transform. The proof adapts the one of Cramer's theorem to the case where the fluctuation is generated by a single variable. In particular, we develop a new tilting strategy for the lower bound, which leads us to introduce a condition on the second derivative of the moment generating function. Our results are illustrated by a couple of simple examples.

Tight-binding models can accurately replicate the band structure and topology of crystalline systems. They have been widely used in solid-state physics due to their versatility and low computational cost. It is straightforward to build an accurate tight-binding model of any crystalline system using the crystal's maximally localized Wannier functions as a basis. Unfortunately, in 3D photonic crystals, the transversality condition of Maxwell's equations precludes the construction of a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions via usual techniques. As a result, building reliable tight-binding models of 3D photonic crystals has not been straightforward up to now. In this work, we show how to overcome this problem using topological quantum chemistry, allowing us to express the band structure of the photonic crystal as a difference of band representations. This can be achieved by introducing a set of auxiliary modes, as recently proposed in Christensen et al., Phys. Rev. X 12, 021066 (2022), which regularizes the Gamma-point obstruction arising from the transversality constraint of Maxwell's equations. The decomposition into elementary band representations allows us to isolate a set of pseudo-orbitals that permit us to construct an accurate transversality-enforced tight-binding model that matches the dispersion, symmetry content, and topology of the 3D photonic crystal under study. Moreover, we show how to introduce the effects of a gyrotropic bias in the framework, modeled via non-minimal coupling to a static magnetic field. Our work provides the first systematic method to analytically model the photonic bands of the lowest transverse modes over the entire Brillouin zone via a transversality-enforced tight-binding model.

[209]. [*Anomalous size effects with fixed criticality in bistable flexible mechanical metamaterials*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00187 "Anomalous size effects with fixed criticality in bistable flexible mechanical metamaterials")
Zehuan Tang, Tingfeng Ma, Boyue Su, Qing Xia, Pengfei Kang, Bowei Wu
When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observed anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated due to the implied symmetries between the two steady states. On the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition modes under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effect is no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.

Gr\'egoire Ferr\'e
We study large deviations for the time average of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process raised to an arbitrary power. We prove that beyond a critical value, large deviations are subexponential in time, with a non-convex rate function whose main coefficient is given by the solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi problem. Although a similar problem was addressed in a recent work, the originality of the paper is to provide a short, self-contained proof of this result through a couple of standard large deviations arguments.

Hrushikesh Sable, Nathan M. Myers, Vito W. Scarola
A topological quantum number, the Witten index, characterizes supersymmetric models by probing for zero energy modes and the possibility of supersymmetry breaking. We propose an averaging method to infer the Witten index in quantum analog simulators. Motivated by recent work on Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays, we consider a related supersymmetric XXZ spin model. We show how to infer the Witten index from open system averaging and numerically demonstrate its topological robustness in this model. Our Letter defines a route for quantum analog simulators to directly identify many-body topological physics.

A hallmark of biological tissues, viewed as complex cellular materials, is the active generation of mechanical stresses by cellular processes, such as cell divisions. Each cellular event generates a force dipole that deforms the surrounding tissue. Therefore, a quantitative description of these force dipoles, and their consequences on tissue mechanics, is one of the central problems in understanding the overall tissue mechanics. In this work we analyze previously published experimental data on fruit fly \textit{D. melanogaster} wing epithelia to quantitatively describe the deformation fields induced by a cell-scale force dipole. We find that the measured deformation field can be explained by a simple model of fly epithelium as a linearly elastic sheet. This fact allows us to use measurements of the strain field around cellular events, such as cell divisions, to infer the magnitude and dynamics of the mechanical forces they generate. In particular, we find that cell divisions exert a transient isotropic force dipole field, corresponding to the temporary localisation of the cell nucleus to the tissue surface during the division, and traceless-symmetric force dipole field that remains detectable from the tissue strain field for up to about $3.5$ hours after the division. This is the timescale on which elastic strains are erased by other mechanical processes and therefore it corresponds to the tissue fluidization timescale. In summary, we have developed a method to infer force dipoles induced by cell divisions, by observing the strain field in the surrounding tissues. Using this method we quantitatively characterize mechanical forces generated during a cell division, and their effects on the tissue mechanics.

Light waves do not interact in vacuum, but may mix through various parametric processes when traveling in a nonlinear medium. In particular, a high-amplitude wave can be leveraged to frequency convert a low-amplitude signal, as long as the overall energy and momentum of interacting photons are conserved. These conditions are typically met when all waves propagate in the medium with comparable phase velocity along a particular axis. In this work, we investigate an alternative scheme by which an input microwave signal propagating along a 1-dimensional Josephson metamaterial is converted to an output wave propagating in the opposite direction. The interaction is mediated by a pump wave propagating at low phase velocity. In this regime, the input signal is exponentially attenuated as it travels down the device. We exploit this process to implement a robust on-chip microwave isolator that can be reconfigured into a reciprocal and tunable coupler. The device mode of operation is selected in situ, along with its working frequency over a wide microwave range. We measure an isolation over 5 dB in the 5-8.5 GHz range and over 10 dB in the 7-8.5 GHz range on a typical bandwidth of 200 MHz. Substantial margin for improvement exists through design optimization and by reducing fabrication disorder, opening new avenues for microwave routing and processing in superconducting circuits.

Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell $-$ functions that are inherently connected to their physical properties. A remarkable aspect of such condensates is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation that span about two orders of magnitude in molecular dynamics, diffusivity, and viscosity. We find that the nanoscale chain dynamics on the nano- to microsecond timescale can be accurately related to both translational diffusion and mesoscale condensate viscosity by analytical relations from polymer physics. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction $-$ a key quantity underlying these relations $-$ are caused by differences in inter-residue contact lifetimes, leading to the vastly different dynamics among the condensates. The rapid exchange of inter-residue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.

Yuchen Guo, Ke Ding, Shuo Yang
This study delves into the concept of quantum phases in open quantum systems, examining the shortcomings of existing approaches that focus on steady states of Lindbladians and highlighting their limitations in capturing key phase transitions. In contrast to these methods, we introduce the concept of imaginary-time Lindbladian evolution as an alternative framework. This new approach defines gapped quantum phases in open systems through the spectrum properties of the imaginary-Liouville superoperator. We find that, in addition to all pure gapped ground states, the Gibbs state of a stabilizer Hamiltonian at any finite temperature can also be characterized by our scheme, demonstrated through explicit construction. Moreover, the closing of the imaginary Liouville gap is associated with the divergence of the Markov length, which has recently been proposed as an indicator of phase transitions in open quantum systems. To illustrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to investigate the phase diagram for open systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry, including cases with nontrivial average symmetry protected topological order or spontaneous symmetry breaking order. Our findings demonstrate universal properties at quantum criticality, such as nonanalytic behaviors of steady-state observables, divergence of correlation lengths, and closing of the imaginary-Liouville gap. These results advance our understanding of quantum phase transitions in open quantum systems. In contrast, we find that the steady states of real-time Lindbladians do not provide an effective framework for characterizing phase transitions in open systems.

We prove that in strongly disordered, interacting, quantum chains, the conductance of a chain of length $L$ vanishes faster than $1/L$. This means that transport is anomalous in such chains. This phenomenon was first claimed in \cite{Basko2006,gornyi2005interacting} and a pioneering treatment appeared in \cite{Imbrie2016a}

Denis S. Grebenkov
We consider the mixed Steklov-Neumann spectral problem for the modified Helmholtz equation in a bounded domain when the Steklov condition is imposed on a connected subset of the smooth boundary. In order to deduce the asymptotic behavior in the limit when the size of the subset goes to zero, we reformulate the original problem in terms of an integral operator whose kernel is the restriction of a suitable Green's function (or pseudo-Green's function) to the subset. Its singular behavior on the boundary yields the asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Steklov-Neumann problem. While this analysis remains at a formal level, it is supported by extensive numerical results for two basic examples: an arc on the boundary of a disk and a spherical cap on the boundary of a ball. Solving the original Steklov-Neumann problem numerically in these domains, we validate the asymptotic formulas and reveal their high accuracy, even when the subset is not small. A straightforward application of these spectral results to first-passage processes and diffusion-controlled reactions is presented. We revisit the small-target limit of the mean first-reaction time on perfectly or partially reactive targets. The effect of multiple failed reaction attempts is quantified by a universal function for the whole range of reactivities. Moreover, we extend these results to more sophisticated surface reactions that go beyond the conventional narrow escape problem.

Alon Beck, Noam Levi, Yohai Bar-Sinai
We investigate the phenomenon of grokking -- delayed generalization accompanied by non-monotonic test loss behavior -- in a simple binary logistic classification task, for which "memorizing" and "generalizing" solutions can be strictly defined. Surprisingly, we find that grokking arises naturally even in this minimal model when the parameters of the problem are close to a critical point, and provide both empirical and analytical insights into its mechanism. Concretely, by appealing to the implicit bias of gradient descent, we show that logistic regression can exhibit grokking when the training dataset is nearly linearly separable from the origin and there is strong noise in the perpendicular directions. The underlying reason is that near the critical point, "flat" directions in the loss landscape with nearly zero gradient cause training dynamics to linger for arbitrarily long times near quasi-stable solutions before eventually reaching the global minimum. Finally, we highlight similarities between our findings and the recent literature, strengthening the conjecture that grokking generally occurs in proximity to the interpolation threshold, reminiscent of critical phenomena often observed in physical systems.

Emre Ozan Polat, Zafer Artvin, Yusuf \c{S}aki, Alpan Bek, Ramazan Sahin
We demonstrate that the decay rates of a fluorescent molecule can be controlled by electrically shifting a transparency introduced by a Fano resonance. An auxiliary quantum object (QO), located at the hotspot of a plasmonic nanoparticle, suppresses plasmonic excitation at its level spacing {\omega}_QO. As a result, the local density of states (LDOS) associated with the plasmonic spectrum is also suppressed at {\omega}={\omega}_QO. By shifting {\omega}_QO via an applied voltage, we continuously tune the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the fluorescent molecule by up to two orders of magnitude. This mechanism offers a valuable tool for integrated quantum technologies, enabling on-demand entanglement and single-photon sources, voltage-controlled quantum gate operations, and electrical control of superradiant-like phase transitions. The approach also holds promise for applications in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).

We describe a concrete device roadmap towards a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on noise-resilient, topologically protected Majorana-based qubits. Our roadmap encompasses four generations of devices: a single-qubit device that enables a measurement-based qubit benchmarking protocol; a two-qubit device that uses measurement-based braiding to perform single-qubit Clifford operations; an eight-qubit device that can be used to show an improvement of a two-qubit operation when performed on logical qubits rather than directly on physical qubits; and a topological qubit array supporting lattice surgery demonstrations on two logical qubits. Devices that enable this path require a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure that supports a topological phase, quantum dots and coupling between those quantum dots that can create the appropriate loops for interferometric measurements, and a microwave readout system that can perform fast, low-error single-shot measurements. We describe the key design components of these qubit devices, along with the associated protocols for demonstrations of single-qubit benchmarking, Clifford gate execution, quantum error detection, and quantum error correction, which differ greatly from those in more conventional qubits. Finally, we comment on implications and advantages of this architecture for utility-scale quantum computation.

Oscar W. Kennedy, Jared H. Cole, Connor D. Shelly
Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time-varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time-varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.

[222]. [*Sampling Decisions*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14549 "Sampling Decisions")
Michael Chertkov, Sungsoo Ahn, Hamidreza Behjoo
In this manuscript, we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling decisions from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI-driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in stochastic optimal control. It extends the continuous-space, continuous-time Path Integral Diffusion sampling technique of [Behjoo, Chertkov 2025] to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network (GFN) framework of [Bengio, et al 2021]. In its most basic form an explicit formulation that does not require Neural Networks (NNs), DF leverages the linear solvability of the underlying MDP [Todorov, 2007] to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse-time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model -- compare DF to Metropolis-Hastings to quantify its efficiency, discuss potential NN-based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.

Charlie Cummings
We compute various averages over bulk geometries of quantum states prepared by the Chern-Simons path integral, for any level $k$ and compact simple gauge group $G$. We do so by carefully summing over all topologically distinct bulk geometries which have $n$ disjoint boundary tori and a decomposition into space$\times$time of fixed spatial topology. We find that to leading order in the complexity of the state, the typical state contains many types of multiparty entanglement, proving a conjecture of Balasubramanian et al. Additionally, we compute an averaged wave function which captures the leading order statistics of boundary observables in the $n$ torus Chern-Simons Hilbert space.

[224]. [*Universal path decomposition of transfer and scattering matrices*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04822 "Universal path decomposition of transfer and scattering matrices")
Joaquin Garcia-Suarez
We report a universal identity: any entry of a one-dimensional transfer or scattering matrix comprising N layers equals a coherent sum of 2**(N-1) directed paths representing wave patterns with pre-defined amplitude and phase evolutions. Treating those paths as analytic building blocks, we derive closed-form results for arbitrary stratified media - optical, acoustic, elastic, or electronic - without resorting to matrix products or recursion. The combinatorial construction of paths turns layered system design into rule-based path engineering, illustrated with a design example that offers a reinterpretation of the quarter-wavelength principle. We also quantify the computational speed-up of the path method over classical transfer-matrix chaining and showcase two more cross-disciplinary applications (site-response seismology and quantum superlattices). This paradigm replaces numerical sweeps that employ the transfer matrix method with physically-transparent path-construction rules; its applicability spans across physical disciplines and scales: from nanometer optical coatings to kilometer-scale seismic strata.

Claudio Bonati, Ivan Soler Calero
We numerically investigate the multicritical behavior of the three dimensional lattice system in which a SU(2) gauge field is coupled to two flavors of scalar fields transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. In this system a multicritical point is present, where the global symmetry O(2)$\oplus$O(3) gets enlarged to O(5). Such a symmetry enlargement is hindered for generic systems by the instability of the O(5) multicritical point, but the SU(2) gauge symmetry prevents the appearance of the term triggering the instability. All the numerical results obtained in this lattice gauge model fully support the expectations coming from the O(2)$\oplus$O(3) multicritical Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theory, and we discuss possible implications of these results for some models of deconfined quantum criticality.

Can Polat, Erchin Serpedin, Mustafa Kurban, Hasan Kurban
Most materials science datasets are limited to atomic geometries (e.g., XYZ files), restricting their utility for multimodal learning and comprehensive data-centric analysis. These constraints have historically impeded the adoption of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics. MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction, and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision. Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible, versatile materials science datasets. The dataset and implementations are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/MultiCrystalSpectrumSet.

[227]. [*Dynamic Space Filling*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01128 "Dynamic Space Filling")
P. L. Krapivsky
Dynamic space filling (DSF) is a stochastic process defined on any connected graph. Each vertex can host an arbitrary number of particles forming a pile, with every arriving particle landing on the top of the pile. Particles in a pile, except for the particle at the bottom, can hop to neighboring vertices. Eligible particles hop independently and stochastically, with the overall hopping rate set to unity. When the number of vertices in a graph is equal to the total number of particles, the evolution stops when a single particle occupies every vertex. We determine the halting time distribution on complete graphs. Using the mapping of the DSF into a two-species annihilation process, we argue that on $ d$-dimensional tori with $N\gg 1$ vertices, the average halting time scales with the number of vertices as $N^{4/d}$ when $d\leq 4$ and as $N$ when $d>4$.

Version 14 of XtalOpt, an evolutionary multi-objective global optimization algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from its official website https://xtalopt.github.io, and the Computer Physics Communications Library. The new version of the code is designed to perform a ground state search for crystal structures with variable compositions by integrating a suite of ab initio methods alongside classical and machine-learning potentials for structural relaxation. The multi-objective search framework has been enhanced through the introduction of Pareto optimization, enabling efficient discovery of functional materials.

Pietro Brighi, Alberto Biella
In this work we study the dissipative quantum North-East-Center (NEC) model: a two-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice subject to chiral, kinetically constrained dissipation and coherent quantum interactions. This model combines kinetic constraints and chirality at the dissipative level, implementing local incoherent spin flips conditioned by an asymmetric majority-vote rule. Through a cluster mean-field approach, we determine the steady-state phase diagram of the NEC model under different Hamiltonians, consistently revealing the emergence of two distinct phases, bistable and normal, across all cases considered. We further investigate the stability of the steady-state with respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations in both phases, showing the emergence of instabilities at finite wavevectors in the proximity of the phase transition. Next, we study the nonergodicity of the model in the bistable phase. We characterize the dynamics of minority islands of spins surrounded by a large background of spins pointing in the opposite direction. We show that in the bistable phase, the minority islands are always reabsorbed by the surrounding at a constant velocity, irrespectively of their size. Finally, we propose and numerically benchmark an equation of motion for the reabsorption velocity of the islands where thermal and quantum fluctuations act independently at linear order.

In this contribution, we present a systematic study of the performance of two known types of compressible generalization of the incompressible neo-Hookean material model. The first type of generalization is based on the development of vol-iso neo-Hookean models and involves the additive decomposition of the elastic energy into volumetric and isochoric parts. The second simpler type of generalization is based on the development of mixed neo-Hookean models that do not use this decomposition. Theoretical studies of model performance and simulations of some homogeneous deformations have shown that when using volumetric functions $(J^q+J^{-q}-2)/(2q^2)$ ($J$ is the volume ratio, and $q\in \mathbb{R}$ is a parameter, $q\geq 0$) from the Hartmann-Neff family [Hartmann and Neff, Int. J. Solids Structures, 40: 2767-2791 (2003)] with parameter $q\geq 2$ (the preferred value is $q=5$), mixed and vol-iso models show similar performance in applications and have physically reasonable responses in extreme states, which is convenient for theoretical studies. However, contrary to vol-iso models, mixed models allow the use of a wider set of volumetric functions with physically reasonable responses in extreme states. A further feature of mixed models is simpler expressions for stresses and tangent stiffness tensors.

We study the influence of noise on the dynamics of a transverse field Ising model when quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations properties, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the absence of noise, despite the entanglement, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. When noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change dramatically: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with time scale of a ramp quench, with the exponent depending on the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.
