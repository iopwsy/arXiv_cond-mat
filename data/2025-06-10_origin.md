Owing to its high brightness, synchrotron light allows for investigating with extreme precision the physical properties of matter. The irradiation with high-dose X-ray beams may also lead to modification of the latter, thus allowing for material processing. Here we investigate the color change of topaz irradiated with synchrotron light, shedding light on the role played by secondary electrons in the formation of color centers. As a matter of fact, treatments of natural topaz to induce its color change are largely used in the jewelry industry. Nevertheless, the physical mechanisms behind the topaz's color change have not yet been fully understood. To date, it has been shown that the combined action of high-energy beam irradiation (either electrons, neutrons, or {\gamma}-rays) and thermal annealing permits to provide colorless natural topaz with an artificial blue color, which is largely appealed in the gem market. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to irreversibly provide natural topaz with a blue color even by exploiting lower energy beams, such as X-rays, provided that enough dose is absorbed, thus paving the way for developing novel protocols for making artificially blue topazes.

Micron-scale metal-based composite powders are promising for energetic applications due to their tailored ignition and combustion properties. In particular, ball-milled Al/Zr composites exhibit lower ignition thresholds than pure aluminum, driven by exothermic intermetallic formation reactions and have demonstrated enhanced combustion properties. However, the extent to which this heat release governs ignition and combustion remains unclear, especially when progressively removed through annealing. To systematically investigate this effect, we synthesized Al/Zr powders (3Al:Zr, Al:Zr, and Al:3Zr at%) via ball milling, annealed them in argon up to 1000 C to partially complete the formation reactions, and characterized their ignition and combustion behavior. Ignition thresholds were measured using a hot wire method across different environments, while high-speed hyperspectral imaging tracked single-particle burn durations and temperatures. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method was developed to quantify the frequency of microexplosions. Results show that annealing - and thus reducing available reaction heat - increases ignition thresholds, most significantly for Al-rich compositions. In contrast, Zr-rich powders exhibit little change in ignition thresholds due to oxidation aiding ignition. Despite removing the available heat that drives ignition, average combustion temperatures range from 2400-3000 K and increased with annealing for Al- and Zr-rich powders. Average maximum temperatures are 100 to 400 K higher. The frequency of microexplosions remains high (>46%) and increases with annealing for all but the Al-rich powders. These findings suggest that while homogeneous Al/Zr powders (e.g., atomized) may exhibit higher ignition thresholds, they can achieve comparable combustion performance once ignited.

[3]. [*Rheological Origin of Aging*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06365 "Rheological Origin of Aging")
Vikash Pandey
Most materials of practical applications age, and their properties change with time. The aging of materials is reflected in their mechanical responses to external stress and strain, which exhibit ubiquity in the form of logarithms and power laws, respectively. Such responses are usually described using complicated phenomenological models, including fractional viscoelastic models, but they lack physical insights. In this Letter, we postulate a linear time-varying rheological property whose constitutive relations are motivated from thermodynamic principles and experimental observations of the stick-slip-induced friction. The property satisfyingly explains the logarithmic relaxation and the three stages of universal creep behavior. Consequently, the fractional Maxwell model and the Mittag-Leffler function gain physical interpretation. Lastly, we show that viscosity emerges as a special case of the proposed property.

Colloidal lithography has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional nanofabrication techniques, offering the ability to create nanoscale patterns in a cost-effective and scalable manner. However, it has been so far limited by defects such as empty areas or multilayered regions, hindering its application. We introduce a novel "ice-assisted transfer" technique that combines rubbing-based particle assembly on elastomer substrates with ice-mediated transfer to achieve defect-free, high-quality polycrystalline particle monolayers. This approach eliminates foreign material contamination and enables precise control of particle arrangement and density. By optimizing process parameters, including surfactant concentration and water film thickness, we minimized defects and demonstrated the versatility of this method in fabricating functional nanoscale structures. We highlighted the benefits of this process through two applications: (1) antireflective "moth-eye" coatings, which achieved near-zero reflection in the mid-infrared spectrum due to improved particle monolayer quality; and (2) nanostructured surfaces for ligand-free T-cell activation, whose topography enhanced cell activation, showcasing potential for immunotherapy applications. The process achieves rapid, cost-efficient patterning without requiring specialized equipment, making it suitable for diverse fields requiring scalable nanostructuring. This work represents a significant advancement in colloidal lithography, addressing critical challenges and unlocking its potential for practical applications in optics, biotechnology, and beyond.

[5]. [*Anomalous Shear Stress Growth During Relaxation of a Soft Glass*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06393 "Anomalous Shear Stress Growth During Relaxation of a Soft Glass")
Crystal E. Owens
We show experimentally that multiple soft glassy fluids are capable of storing directional rheological signatures from past shear history, evidenced during stress growth and overall nonmonotonic stress relaxation after small steps in strain. We illustrate theoretically that these responses can be reproduced without requiring thixotropy or shear-banding, which are typically implicated in time-dependent rheological complexities, but by using a simple elastoplastic rheological model with power-law yielding (EP-PLY) that incorporates a distribution of local strain states. Using insight from the model, we suggest a mechanism for the experimentally observed stress increase to be driven by residual anisotropy in strain states that are relaxed at different rates. We demonstrate that these effects persist even after material is stressed beyond the yield stress, indicating that past deformation may have more influence than previously thought.

[6]. [*Momentum-space Metric Tensor from Nonadiabatic Evolution of Bloch Electrons*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06439 "Momentum-space Metric Tensor from Nonadiabatic Evolution of Bloch Electrons")
Yafei Ren
We reveal a fundamental geometric structure of momentum space arising from the nonadiabatic evolution of Bloch electrons. By extending semiclassical wave packet theory to incorporate nonadiabatic effects, we introduce a momentum-space metric tensor -- the nonadiabatic metric. This metric gives rise to two velocity corrections, dubbed geometric and geodesic velocities, providing a unified and intuitive framework for understanding nonlinear and nonadiabatic transport phenomena beyond Berry phase effects. Furthermore, we show that the nonadiabatic metric endows momentum space with a curved geometry, recasting wave packet dynamics as forced geodesic motion. In this picture, the metric defines distances, the Berry connection acts as a gauge potential, band dispersion serves as a scalar potential, and the toroidal topology of the Brillouin zone imposes periodic boundary conditions. When the nonadiabatic metric is constant, it reduces to an effective mass, allowing electrons to behave as massive particles in flat bands. In a flat Chern band with harmonic attractive interactions, the two-body wave functions mirror the Landau-level wave functions on a torus.

Aashish K. Gupta, Christopher Ness, Sina Haeri
Characterizing the degeneracy of local stress states is a central challenge in obtaining the complete statistical mechanics of disordered media. Here, we introduce a minimal force-balance model for isolated granular clusters to probe the structure of the stress space through principal stress orientation and stress anisotropy. We further show that when complemented by physically motivated pairwise constraints, the model produces predictions for the stress alignment in packings of repulsive hard spheres. We compare these predictions against simulation data for grains in hopper and simple shear flows, finding quantitative agreement. This demonstrates the promise of modeling bulk athermal disordered systems through the combinatorics of few primitive geometric motifs.

Leonardo Ermann, Alexei D. Chepelianskii, Dima L. Shepelyansky
We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is characterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short times and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This behavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the formation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion, energy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity.
  System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.

In spintronics, the spin Hall effect has been widely used to generate and detect spin currents in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling such as Pt and Ta. Recently, its orbital counterpart has drawn attention as a new tool to generate and detect orbital currents and thus investigate orbital transport parameters. In this study, we investigate vanadium (V), a $3d$ transition metal with weak spin-orbit coupling but with a theoretically large orbital Hall conductivity. We measure a large Hanle magnetoresistance in V thin films with a magnitude comparable to that of heavy metals and at least one order of magnitude higher than the spin Hall magnetoresistance observed in a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/V bilayer, pointing to the orbital Hall origin of the effect. A fit of the magnetic-field dependence and thickness dependence of the Hanle magnetoresistance to the standard diffusion model allows us to quantify the orbital diffusion length (~2 nm) and the orbital Hall conductivity (~78 ($\hbar/2e$) $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$) of V. The obtained orbital Hall conductivity is two orders of magnitude smaller than theoretical calculations of the intrinsic value, suggesting there is an important role of disorder.

Understanding and controlling native defects is essential for unlocking the full potential of two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors. Here, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations are used to explore the electronic properties of bulk CrSBr. ARPES measurements reveal clear signatures of conduction band filling in as-grown crystals, indicative of unintentional doping. An analysis of intrinsic defects based on density functional theory (DFT) identifies chromium interstitials ($Cr_i$) stabilized between CrSBr layers as the most favorable shallow donors. Bromine-on-sulfur antisites ($Br_S$) and bromine vacancies ($V_{Br}$) are also found to act as potential donors, albeit with deeper ionization energies. Our results shed light on the origin of unintentional $\textit{n}$-type doping of CrSBr and pave the way for new strategies for defect control and electronic property tuning in this van der Waals magnet.

Yan Jun Lin, Zhengyang Liu, Sunghwan Jung
Traditional surface cleaning methods often suffer from drawbacks such as chemical harshness, potential for surface damage, and high energy consumption. This study investigates an alternative approach: acoustic-driven surface cleaning using millimeter-sized bubbles excited at low, sub-cavitation frequencies. We identify and characterize a distinct translational resonance of these bubbles, occurring at significantly lower frequencies (e.g., 50 Hz for 1.3 mm diameter bubbles) than the Minnaert resonance for a bubble of the same size. Experiments reveal that at this translational resonance, stationary bubbles exhibit amplified lateral swaying, while bubbles sliding on an inclined surface display pronounced "stop-and-go" dynamics. The theoretical model treats the bubble as a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, where surface tension provides the restoring force and the inertia is dominated by the hydrodynamic added mass of the surrounding fluid. It accurately predicts the observed resonant frequency scaling with bubble size ($\propto R_0^{-3/2}$). Cleaning efficacy, assessed using protein-based artificial soil on glass slides, was improved by approximately 90\% when bubbles were driven at their translational resonant frequency compared to off-resonant frequencies or non-acoustic conditions. These findings demonstrate that leveraging translational resonance enhances bubble-induced shear and agitation, offering an effective and sustainable mechanism for surface cleaning.

Recent advances in ferroelectrics highlight the role of three-dimensional (3D) polar entities in forming topological polar textures and generating giant electromechanical responses, during polarization rotation. However, current electron microscopy methods lack the depth resolution to resolve the polarization component along the electron beam direction, which restricts full characterization. Here, we present a deep learning framework combined with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy to reconstruct 3D polarization maps in Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 thin-film capacitors with picometer-level accuracy under applied electric fields. Our approach enables observation of polar nanodomains consistent with the polar slush model and shows that switching occurs through coordinated vector rotation toward <111> energy minima, rather than magnitude changes. Furthermore, regions with higher topological density exhibit smaller polarization variation when the electric field changes, indicating topological protection. Our work reveals the value of 3D polarization mapping in elucidating complex nanoscale polar phenomena, with broad implications for emergent ferroelectrics.

We investigate an explicit example of how spatial decoherence can lead to hydrodynamic behavior in the late-time, long-wavelength regime of open quantum systems. We focus on the case of a single non-relativistic quantum particle linearly coupled to a thermal bath of noninteracting harmonic oscillators at temperature $T$, a la Caldeira and Leggett. Taking advantage of decoherence in the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\gamma$, which quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force. Our results shed new light on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in quantum systems with few degrees of freedom.

Quantum materials and phenomena have attracted great interest for their potential applications in next-generation microelectronics and quantum-information technologies. In one especially interesting class of quantum materials, moire superlattices (MSL) formed by twisted bilayers of 2D materials, a wide range of novel phenomena are observed. However, there exist daunting challenges such as reproducibility and scalability of utilizing 2D MSLs for microelectronics and quantum technologies due to their exfoliate-tear-stack method. Here, we propose lithography defined semiconductor moires superlattices, in which three fundamental parameters, electron-electron interaction, spin-orbit coupling, and band topology, are designable. We experimentally investigate quantum transport properties in a moire specimen made in an InAs quantum well. Strong anomalous in-gap states are observed within the same integer quantum Hall state. Our work opens up new horizons for studying 2D quantum-materials phenomena in semiconductors featuring superior industry-level quality and state-of-the-art technologies, and they may potentially enable new quantum information and microelectronics technologies.

Qianbiao Liu, Lijun Zhu
Despite the remarkable efforts in the past two decades, it has remained a major challenge to achieve switching of perpendicularly magnetized spin-orbit torque devices in a scalable, energy-efficient, field-free, integration-friendly, and complete manner. Here, we report giant enhancement of z spin generation in low-resistivity spin Hall metal/FeCoB devices by alloying the spin Hall metal Pt with Ti and by electric asymmetry engineering. The dampinglike spin torques of z spins and y spins are enhanced by 6 and 3 times relative to that of conventional Pt/FeCoB and enable complete, record-low-power, deterministic switching of FeCoB devices with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and high coercivity. The Pt75Ti25/FeCoB heterostructure also exhibits relatively low resistivity, wafer-scale uniform sputter-deposition on silicon oxide, good compatibility with magnetic tunnel junctions, and excellent thermal stability of exceeding 400 C. These results unambiguously establish the Pt75Ti25/FeCoB as the most compelling candidate for solving the bottleneck of scalable, energy-efficient, field-free, integration-friendly, and complete spin-orbit torque switching technologies. This work also provides a universal strategy for developing high-performance generators of z spin current and will stimulate the exploration of exotic spin currents by alloying trivial spin Hall materials.

Oleg I. Utesov, Yeongjun Kim, Sergej Flach
We explore properties of a Gross-Pitaevskii chain subject to an incommensurate periodic potential, i.e., a nonlinear Aubry-Andre model. We show that the condensate crucially impacts the properties of the elementary excitations. In contrast to the conventional linear Aubry-Andre model, the boundary between localized and extended states (mobility edge) exhibits nontrivial branching. For instance, in the high-density regime, tongues of extended phases at intermediate energies penetrate the domain of localized states. In the low-density case, the situation is opposite, and tongues of localized phases emerge. Moreover, intermediate critical (fractal) states are observed. The low-energy phonon part of the spectrum is robust against the incommensurate potential. Our study shows that accounting for interactions, already at the classical level, lead to highly nontrivial behavior of the elementary excitation spectrum.

Jiahao Li, Kusma Kumari Cheepurupalli, Niall J. English, Sateesh Bandaru, Xuefeng Zhang
This study investigates Mn-Zn ferrites (nominal composition \ce{Mn_{0.5}Zn_{0.5}Fe2O4}, MZF) substituted with tetravalent (\ce{Si^{4+}}), trivalent (\ce{Co^{3+}}), and divalent (\ce{Ca^{2+}}, \ce{Mg^{2+}}, \ce{Sn^{2+}}) ions. We comprehensively analyze how substitutions at specific tetrahedral and octahedral crystallographic sites modulate the spinel lattice's structural stability, electronic band structure, magnetic anisotropy, and electrical conductivity. Density functional theory (DFT) combined with Boltzmann transport theory is employed to probe the thermoelectric and phonon transport properties of pristine and doped MZF systems. Formation energy calculations indicate that substitutions with \ce{Si^{4+}}, \ce{Ca^{2+}}, and \ce{Mg^{2+}} enhance the thermodynamic stability of MZF, while \ce{Co^{3+}} and \ce{Sn^{2+}} substitutions exhibit slightly higher formation energies, indicating relatively lower stability. Electronic structure analyses confirm all substituted variants retain a finite band gap, preserving their semiconducting nature. Magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) calculations reveal that ferrites with mixed octahedral/tetrahedral substitutions display a narrower MAE distribution, signifying more uniform magnetic anisotropy. Thermoelectric property analysis at 300 K demonstrates that multivalent ion doping at either crystallographic site reduces electrical conductivity ($\sigma$) while concurrently enhancing the Seebeck coefficient ($S$). This inverse correlation highlights a doping-induced trade-off, likely driven by increased carrier scattering at defect sites and modifications to the electronic density of states near the Fermi level.

Arindam Tarafdar, Tigran A. Sedrakyan
We report the quantization, quantum oscillations, and singular behavior of sublattice symmetry-breaking sublattice charge order (SCO) in two-dimensional Dirac insulators at charge neutrality under perpendicular magnetic fields $B$. SCO is induced by staggered sublattice potentials, such as those originating from substrates, strains, hydrogenation, and chemical doping. In small non-quantizing magnetic fields that result in less than a flux quantum threading the system, and small sublattice symmetry breaking potentials, SCO exhibits perturbative singular magnetic field dependence, $\sim |B|$, originating from hopping between neighboring sites of the same sublattice. At intermediate magnetic fields, when the cyclotron gap between the zeroth Landau level and the first Landau level, $\omega_c$, is smaller than the sublattice potential, $\omega_c\lesssim \Delta$, SCO shows $\textit{universally}$ quantized plateaus owing to discrete Landau-level degeneracy. As the magnetic flux increases by one flux quantum, one electron (per spin) is transferred from the sublattice with a higher chemical potential to the sublattice with a lower chemical potential. One electron transfer between sublattices per flux quantum results from the sublattice polarization of the zeroth Landau level in gapped Dirac materials, realizing the topological Thouless pump effect. At stronger magnetic fields, $\omega_c\gtrsim \ \Delta$, corresponding to integer quantum Hall regimes, SCO displays singularities based on the physics of quantum magneto-oscillations. Our findings suggest new ways to experimentally detect the presence of the energy gap in Dirac materials, irrespective of the gap size.

The anisotropy of the superconducting state and superconducting fluctuations in the CuO2 plane is directly related to the superconducting mechanism of copper oxide superconductors and is therefore pivotal for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we integrated the high-precision angle-resolved resistivity (ARR) measurement with a rotatable in-plane magnetic field to systematically study the angular dependence of superconducting fluctuations in optimally doped La1.84Sr0.16CuO4 (LSCO). By independently controlling the directions of the current and the magnetic field, we are able to isolate the magneto-resistivity contributed by the superconducting vortex motion and distinguish excitations from nematic superconductivity and d-wave superconductive order based on their respective C2 and C4 symmetries. Signatures of two intertwined superconductive orders are also evident in the measured angular dependence of the critical current. A T-B phase diagram of different types of superconducting fluctuations is determined. These findings are closely related to other intriguing phenomena, such as pair density wave and charge density wave.

In this review, we present our recent works on materials whose common point is the presence of electronic bands of very low dispersion, called "flat bands", which are always the signature of an electronic confinement. A first part is devoted to the cases where this confinement is due to the long-range geometry of the defect-free structure. We have thus studied periodic approximant structures of quasiperiodic Penrose and octagonal tilings, and twisted bilayers of graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) whose rotation angle between the two layers assumes a special value, called "magic angle". In these materials, the flat bands correspond to electronic states distributed over a very large number of atoms (several hundreds or even thousands of atoms) and are very sensitive to small structural distortions such as "heterostrain". Their electronic transport properties cannot be described by usual Bloch-Boltzmann theories, because the interband terms of the velocity operator dominate the intraband terms as far as quantum diffusion is concerned. In twisted bilayer graphene, flat bands can induce a magnetic state and other electron-electron correlation effects. The second part focuses on 2D nanomaterials in the presence of local point defects that cause resonant electronic states (vacancies, adsorbed atoms or molecules). We present studies on monolayer graphene, twisted or Bernal bilayer graphene, carbon nanotubes, monolayer and multilayer black phosphorene, and monolayer TMDs. A recent result is the discovery that the selective functionalization of a Bernal bilayer graphene sublattice leads to a metallic or insulating behavior depending on the functionalized sublattice type. This result, which seems to be confirmed by very recent experimental measurements, suggests that functionalization can be a key parameter to control the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials.

Polarized wavelength-tunable electroluminescence (EL) represents a critical on-demand functionality for next-generation optoelectronics. While conventional van der Waals (vdW) EL devices offer discrete wavelength switching constrained by fixed emission states, we report a novel platform enabling continuous spectral tuning combined with intrinsically polarized emission. By leveraging exciton-assisted inelastic tunneling in the anisotropic magnet CrSBr, our devices achieve uniform EL with a near unity degree of linear polarization ($\approx$ 94.3$\%$). The strong magneto-electronic coupling in CrSBr facilitates continuous magnetic-field-controlled spectral tuning through spin canting-induced band renormalization. This work establishes vdW magnets as a versatile platform for developing reconfigurable polarized light sources with simultaneous spectral and polarization control.

[*What Really Drives Thermopower: Specific Heat or Entropy as the Unifying Principle Across Magnetic, Superconducting, and Nanoscale Systems*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06745 "What Really Drives Thermopower: Specific Heat or Entropy as the Unifying Principle Across Magnetic, Superconducting, and Nanoscale Systems")
Morteza Jazandari, Jahanfar Abouie, Daryoosh Vashaee
Thermopower, a key parameter in thermoelectric performance, is often linked to either specific heat or entropy, yet the fundamental quantity that governs it has remained elusive. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework that identifies entropy per carrier, not specific heat, as the universal driver of thermopower across both closed and open systems. Using thermodynamic identities and the Onsager-Kelvin relation, we show that thermopower is universally proportional to entropy per carrier, while its apparent proportionality to specific heat arises only in systems where the specific heat follows a continuous power-law temperature dependence. To extend this framework to magnetic systems, we derive a general expression for magnon-drag thermopower that holds in both Newtonian (massive, parabolic) and relativistic (massless, linear) magnon regimes. In particular, we reformulate the momentum balance using a relativistic energy-momentum tensor, resolving conceptual inconsistencies in prior models that relied on ill-defined magnon masses in antiferromagnets. Our framework is further illustrated through three representative systems: (i) magnetic materials, where magnon and paramagnon entropy sustain thermopower across TC and TN; (ii) superconducting Nb, where anomalous thermopower emerges from entropy carried by Bogoliubov quasiparticles near TC; and (iii) a single-molecule junction, where entropy from occupation-number fluctuations governs thermopower in an open quantum system. We validate our unifying principle by comparing it with experimental data: thermopower measurements of superconducting niobium reveal the role of quasiparticle entropy near the critical temperature, and literature-reported specific heat data from a wide range of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials demonstrate consistent entropy-based scaling across magnetic transitions.

Based on deep neural networks (DNNs), deep learning has been successfully applied to many problems, but its mechanism is still not well understood -- especially the reason why over-parametrized DNNs can generalize. A recent statistical mechanics theory on supervised learning by a prototypical multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on some artificial learning scenarios predicts that adjustable parameters of over-parametrized MLPs become strongly constrained by the training data close to the input/output boundaries, while the parameters in the center remain largely free, giving rise to a solid-liquid-solid structure. Here we establish this picture, through numerical experiments on benchmark real-world data using a thermal deep learning machine that explores the phase space of the synaptic weights and neurons. The supervised training is implemented by a GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics algorithm, which operates at very low temperatures, and the trained machine exhibits good generalization ability in the test. Global and layer-specific dynamics, with complex non-equilibrium aging behavior, are characterized by time-dependent auto-correlation and replica-correlation functions. Our analyses reveal that the design space of the parameters in the liquid and solid layers are respectively structureless and hierarchical. Our main results are summarized by a data storage ratio -- network depth phase diagram with liquid and solid phases. The proposed thermal machine, which is a physical model with a well-defined Hamiltonian, that reduces to MLP in the zero-temperature limit, can serve as a starting point for physically interpretable deep learning.

Suman Majumder, Saikat Chakraborty
An extended polymer collapses to form a globule when subjected to a quench below the collapse transition temperature. The process begins with the formation of clusters of monomers or ``pearls''. The nascent clusters merge, resulting in growth of the average cluster size $C_s$, eventually leading to a single globule. The aggregation of the clusters are known to be analogous to droplet coalescence. This suggests a striking resemblance between such an aggregation and cluster-cluster aggregation in colloidal self-assembly, which is characterized by a universal dynamic scaling behavior. Motivated by that, here, we verify the presence of such dynamic scaling during the collapse of a polymer with varying bending stiffness $\kappa$, using molecular dynamic simulations. We probe the dynamics via time evolution of the size distribution of clusters $N_s(t)$ and growth of $C_s(t)$. Irrespective of $\kappa$, we observe the power-law scalings $C_s(t)\sim t^z$ and $N_s(t)\sim t^{-w} s^{-\tau}$, of which only the cluster growth is universal with $z\approx 1.65$. Importantly, our results indeed show that $N_s(t)$ exhibits a dynamic scaling of the form $N_s(t)\sim s^{-2}f(s/t^z)$, indicative of a scale-free cluster growth. Interestingly, for flexible and weakly stiff polymers the dynamic exponents obey the relation $w=2z$, as also found in diffusion-controlled cluster-cluster aggregation of particles. For $\kappa \ge 5$, the exponents show deviation from this relation, which grows continuously with $\kappa$. We identify the differences in local structures of the clusters formed, leading to variations in cluster-size dependence of the effective diffusion constant to be the origin of the above deviation. We also discuss potential experimental strategies to directly visualize the observed dynamic scaling in a collapsing polymer.

Traditionally, advancements in semiconductor devices have been driven by lattice-matched heterojunctions with tailored band alignments through heteroepitaxy techniques. However, there is significant interest in expanding the capabilities of heterojunction devices, in particular utilizing extreme lattice mismatches. We demonstrate the manipulation of device behaviors and performance enhancement achievable through a lattice-mismatched, single-crystalline GaAs/GeSn-multi-quantum well (MQW)/Ge n-i-p heterojunction by employing advanced semiconductor grafting technology. With engineered band alignment and optical field distribution, the grafted GaAs/GeSn-MQW/Ge n-i-p photodiode achieved outstanding performance: a record-low dark current density of 1.22E10^-7 A/cm^2, an extended spectral response from ~0.5 to 2 um, and improved photoresponsivity of RVIS of 0.85 A/W and RNIR of 0.40 A/W at 520 and 1570 nm, respectively. The dark current density is at least 5 orders of magnitude lower than state-of-the-art GeSn photodiodes. The photoresponsivity demonstrates an approximately sevenfold enhancement in the VIS range and a threefold improvement in the NIR range compared to the reference epitaxial photodiode. This work presents a unique strategy for constructing lattice-mismatched semiconductor heterojunction devices. More importantly, the implications transcend the current GaAs/GeSn-MQW/Ge example, offering potential applications in other material systems and freeing device design from the stringent lattice-matching constraints of conventional heteroepitaxy.

J. W. Gonz\'alez, L. Rosales
Strain engineering provides a powerful pathway to manipulate quantum transport in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate that biaxial strain induces a semiconductor-to-half-metal transition in monolayer NiI$_2$, triggered by the selective closure of its spin-down band gap while maintaining a robust ferromagnetic ground state. This transition is accompanied by a dramatic and non-monotonic violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, with the Lorenz number exceeding seven times the Sommerfeld limit ($L/L_0 \approx 7.17$). The anomaly arises from the strain-sensitive hybridization between Ni-$d$ and I-$p$ orbitals, leading to a pronounced decoupling between charge and heat transport. These findings establish monolayer NiI$_2$ as a tunable platform for spin-caloritronic functionalities and a model system for exploring non-Fermi-liquid behavior in low dimensions, thereby opening avenues for energy-efficient quantum devices.

X. R. Tian, D. M. Zhang, B. Zhang, D. Y. Sun, X. G. Gong
In supercooled liquids, at a temperature between the glass transition temperature Tg and the melting point Tm, thermodynamic properties remain continuous, while dynamic behavior exhibits anomalies. The origin of such thermodynamics-dynamic decoupling has long been a puzzle in the field of glass researches. In this study, we show that the ratio of the alpha-relaxation time associated with the relative and center-of-mass coordinate of nearest-neighbor atomic pairs can effectively characterize the dynamic features of supercooled liquids. With this approach, supercooled liquids can be categorized into two distinct 'states' based on their dynamics: solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. We further propose four possible paths from the liquid to the final glass state, each exhibiting unique thermodynamic and dynamic behaviors. Two of these paths predict a characteristic temperature Tx between Tm and Tg, where a crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors occurs in supercooled liquids. The molecular dynamics simulations of several supercooled liquids reveal that the actual path followed by all these systems undergo the crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. Tx is found to reside in a similar temperature range as the critical temperature Tc in the mode-coupling theory and the breakdown temperature Tb of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This crossover provides a new microscopic perspective for explaining macroscopic dynamic anomalies, and the absence of a typical thermodynamic phase transition at Tg.

Satyen Dhamankar, Michael A. Webb
In polymer solutions, the phenomenon of cononsolvency describes when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for the polymer over some specific composition range. Observations of cononsolvency typically relate to either phase separation at the macroscopic level or chain collapse at the microscopic level. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between the macroscopic and microscopic observations of cononsolvency and how these differ by mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we distinguish between different mechanisms of cononsolvency using various models and observations derived from a single theoretical framework for polymer solutions. We first use mean-field analysis to identify energetic regimes, which are defined by sets of effective $\chi$ parameters, where changes in solvent/cosolvent composition induce phase separation. Next, to make a connection to the microscopic physics, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations of models with interactions that align with these effective $\chi$ parameters from these different regimes and observe corresponding composition-induced coil-globule transitions. These transitions are elucidated with signatures associated with specific mechanisms of cononsolvency from the literature. Interestingly, systems with identical effective $\chi$ parameters can display different mechanisms at the microscopic level. Ultimately, these results provide new insights into cononsolvency that may help to distinguish amongst mechanisms or inform strategies to control polymer solution behavior.

Evan M. Wilson, Jian-Xin Zhu, Jason T. Haraldsen
We investigate the thermodynamics and energy eigenstates of a spin-1/2 coupled trimer, tetramer in a star configuration, and tetrahedron. Using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with additional Kitaev interactions, we explore the thermodynamic signatures of the Kitaev interaction. Our results show that introducing a Kitaev interaction generates a second Schottky anomaly in the heat capacity for systems with a large K/J ratio. The Kitaev term also introduces nonlinear eigenvalues with respect to a magnetic field, pushing the clusters toward a regime similar to the incomplete Paschen-Back effect and triggering first and second-order quantum phase transitions along with robust thermodynamic behavior. Through this approach, we provide exact analytical solutions that offer insights into Kitaev interactions, both in molecular magnets and in extended systems such as honeycomb or Kagome lattices. Furthermore, we provide insight into experimental measurements for detecting Kitaev interactions in clusters.

Wei-Wei Wang, Jin Yang, Jian-Ping Lv, Chao Zhang
We investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model on a honeycomb superlattice. The interplay between the superlattice potential depth $\Delta/t$ and the onsite interaction $U/t$ gives rise to three distinct quantum phases at zero temperature: a superfluid phase, a Mott insulator I phase with unit filling on each site, and a Mott insulator II phase characterized by density imbalance-double occupancy on one sublattice and vacancy on the other at unit filling. The SF-MI transitions are found to be continuous, consistent with second-order quantum phase transitions. We further extend our analysis to finite temperatures within the superfluid regime. Our work highlights how a honeycomb superlattice geometry enables access to interaction- and lattice-modulation-driven quantum phases, including a density-imbalanced Mott insulator and a robust superfluid regime, offering concrete theoretical predictions for cold-atom experiments.

HongZheng Liu, YiNuo Tian, Zhiyue Wu
Classical thermodynamic singularities at phase transitions and in negative-temperature regimes arise because the equal-a-priori probability postulate overlooks the quantum dynamical complexity required to prepare microstates. We promote bounded dynamical complexity to a postulate and develop Complexity Windowed Thermodynamics (CWT). Introducing a finite complexity budget yields the windowed entropy, an entropy of ignorance that is smooth in energy and monotonically non-increasing in the budget. Smoothness guarantees a finite, continuous effective temperature and a non-negative complexity generation potential, thereby regularizing all classical singularities while recovering standard statistical mechanics as the complexity budget approaches infinity. CWT's generalized first law unveils an information processing work term. From unitary channel geometry we derive universal bounds on action and time: the action consumed must be proportional to the optimal circuit complexity, while the minimum required time is inversely proportional to the effective temperature. The framework unifies phenomena from critical point smoothing to black hole information flow, and predicts that the universe's total generatable complexity and its holographic entropy are of the same order bridging thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.

Dinesh Wagle, Yi Li, Anish Rai, Tomas Polakovic, Valentine Novosad, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch
We demonstrate spin pumping driven by a strongly coupled magnon-photon system using a ferromagnet-coplanar superconducting resonator hybrid system at 1.4 K. Electrical readout via the inverse spin-Hall effect reveals characteristic coupling features, including mode splitting and linewidth broadening, demonstrating the electrical detection of strongly coupled microwave photons and magnons. The magnon-photon coupling strength obtained by combined spin pumping and inverse spin-Hall effect measurements is compared to microwave transmission experiments. Furthermore, microwave power-dependent measurements reveal a decrease in the coupling strength with increasing microwave power alongside the onset of nonlinearities of the superconducting resonator above a critical microwave power threshold.

Sebin J. Sebastian, R. Kolay, Abhidev. B, Q. -P. Ding, Y. Furukawa, R. Nath
We report a comprehensive experimental investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, static, and dynamic properties of a triangular lattice antiferromagnet Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$. Through the analysis of magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and specific heat, complemented by crystal electric field (CEF) calculations, we confirm the Kramers' doublet with effective spin $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ ground state. Magnetic susceptibility and isothermal magnetization analysis reveal a weak antiferromagnetic interaction among the $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ spins, characterized by a small Curie-Weiss temperature ($\theta_{\text{CW}}^{\text{LT}}\simeq-0.26$ K) or a reduced exchange coupling ($J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 0.18$ K). The $^{51}$V NMR spectra and spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) show no evidence of magnetic long-range-order down to 1.6 K but reflect strong influence of CEF excitations in the intermediate temperatures. At low temperatures, $1/T_1(T)$ shows pronounced frequency dependence and $1/T_1$ vs field in different temperatures follows the scaling behaviour, highlighting the role of paramagnetic fluctuations. The CEF calculations using the point charge approximation divulge a large energy gap ($\sim 18.61$ meV) between the lowest and second lowest energy doublets, further establishing Kramers' doublet as the ground state. Our calculations also reproduce the experimental magnetization and specific heat data and indicate an in-plane magnetic anisotropy. These findings position Rb$_3$Yb(VO$_4$)$_2$ as an ideal and disorder-free candidate to explore intrinsic quantum fluctuations and possible quantum spin-liquid physics in a Yb$^{3+}$-based triangular lattice antiferromagnet.

Vinayak Shantaram Bhat, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch
Investigating the emergence of complexity in disordered interacting systems, central to fields like spin glass physics, remains challenging due to difficulties in systematic experimental tuning. We introduce a tunable artificial spin lattice platform to directly probe the connection between controlled structural disorder and collective spin-wave dynamics. By precisely varying positional and rotational randomness in Ni81Fe19 nanobar arrays from periodic to random, we map the evolution from discrete spectral modes to a complex, dense manifold. Crucially, we establish a quantitative correlation between information-theoretic measures of static disorder and the dynamic spectral complexity derived from the GHz spin-wave response. This correlation provides a dynamic fingerprint of an increasingly complex energy landscape resulting from tuned disorder. Furthermore, thermal probe via thermal Brillouin light scattering reveal significantly richer microstates diversity in disordered states than driven probe using broadband ferromagnetic resonance. Our work presents a unique experimental testbed for studying how the ingredients of glassy physics manifest in high-frequency dynamics, offering quantitative insights into the onset of complexity in interacting nanomagnet systems.

Herein, we present an experimental demonstration of the robust exciton-trion polaritons (ETPs) by measuring and simulating the resonance reflectance spectra of various configurational WS2 monolayers with different dielectric screenings. Moreover, the oscillator strength and decoherent behavior of such hybrid ETPs can be tuned via utilizing dielectric screening effect. The effect is attributed to the regulation of the Coulomb coupling between excitons and trions by changing the surrounding dielectric constant. The demonstration and tunability of the robust ETPs offers a novel pathway for researching novel phases of quantum matter in a quantum many-body physics regime.

Accurate interatomic potentials (IAPs) are essential for modeling the potential energy surfaces (PES) that govern atomic interactions in materials. However, most existing IAPs are developed for bulk materials and struggle to accurately and efficiently capture the diverse chemical environment of two-dimensional (2D) materials. This limitation poses a significant barrier to the large-scale design and simulation of emerging 2D systems. To address this challenge, we present a universal interatomic potential tailored for 2D materials. Our model is trained on a dataset comprising 327,062 structure-energy-force-stress mappings derived from 20,114 2D materials, spanning 89 chemical elements. The results show high predictive accuracy, with mean absolute errors of 6 meV/atom for energies, 80 meV/\AA for atomic forces, and 0.067 GPa for stress tensors. It demonstrates broad applicability across a range of atomistic tasks, including structural relaxation, lattice dynamics, molecular dynamics, material discovery, and so on. To further enhance usability and accessibility, we introduce an intelligent agent powered by a large language model (LLM), enabling natural language interaction for 2D materials property simulations. Our work provides not only a precise and universal IAP for 2D systems, but also an intelligent, user-friendly platform that enables high-throughput screening, property prediction, and theoretical exploration, thereby accelerating advances in 2D materials research.

[37]. [*Dimensionless Hierarchical Topological Phononic States*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07048 "Dimensionless Hierarchical Topological Phononic States")
Joel R. Pyfrom, Kai Sun, Jihong A. Ma
Topological insulators exhibit unique boundary states that are protected by the topology of the bulk bands, a phenomenon that has now been extended to classical systems such as phononics and mechanics. Typically, nontrivial topology in an $n$-dimensional bulk leads to the emergence of $(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states. However, these states can often be gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them, resulting in the possible creation of new in-gap higher-order topological modes. A notable example of this is the higher-order topological insulator (HOTI), where gapping out surface states leads to the formation of lower-dimensional topological modes, such as hinge or corner states. This process reduces the spatial dimensionality of the protected modes from $(n-1)$ to $(n-2)$ or even lower. In this work, we propose an alternative method to achieve higher-order topological modes using a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Instead of relying on dimensional reduction, we manipulate the positions of domain walls to gap out the originally topologically protected domain-wall states, thereby inducing new higher-order topological states. These new higher-order topological states can be characterized using a generalized winding number calculation. This approach allows for the realization of multiple (and even infinite) topological orders within simple 1D lattices while maintaining the principle of bulk-boundary correspondence. Our study reveals a new mechanism that enriches topological hierarchies beyond conventional classifications. Such a mechanism could also be extended to higher dimensions, potentially creating intricate networks of topological states and advancing our control over wave phenomena.

Antiferromagnets are a promising platform for next-generation spintronics due to their ultrafast spin dynamics and robustness to external fields. All-optical control of antiferromagnetic order is essential to fully exploit their potential in energy-efficient and high-speed spintronic and memory applications. However, optical writing of antiferromagnetic domains remains a fundamental challenge, as conventional magneto-optical techniques rely on net magnetization, which is absent in antiferromagnets. In certain multiferroic antiferromagnets, the magnetic toroidal moment provides an additional degree of freedom through its inherent magnetoelectric coupling. This coupling at higher frequencies results in the optical magnetoelectric effect (OME), which manifests as a directional asymmetry in light propagation and enables optical probing of antiferromagnetic states. Here, we demonstrate all-optical writing of antiferromagnetic domains using the inverse optical magnetoelectric effect (IOME) in ferrotoroidic LiNiPO4. The writing process is nonvolatile, non-thermal, and deterministic, driven solely by reversing the light propagation direction. This directional control arises from a strong coupling between the photon linear momentum and the magnetic toroidal moment, enabling the repeatable switching between time-reversed domains with arbitrary light polarization. Our findings establish IOME as a distinct mechanism for manipulating antiferromagnetic order, opening a new paradigm in opto-magnetism driven by photon momentum.

Si Min Chan, Beno\^it Gr\'emaud, G. George Batrouni
We study the interplay between on-site disorder and fermion pairing on the quasi one-dimensional flat band Creutz lattice. Both disorder and flat bands localize particles, but an attractive interaction results in pair formation and delocalization giving rise to superconductivity. In this work, we examine the attractive Hubbard model on the Creutz lattice to study the competition between these two effects and elucidate the properties of the superconducting phase and the localization quantum phase transition as the disorder strength is increased. Our main result is that flat band superconductivity is robust against disorder: The critical disorder strength, $W_c$, required to localize the fermion pairs and destroy superconductivity, is finite at any interaction strength, $U$, and is proportional to the superconducting weight, $D_s$, of the clean system. Using large scale density matrix renormalization group computations, we show that this transition is of the BKT form. In addition, even at very small interaction strength, the localization is not due to single fermion localization but to pair localization. For completeness, we briefly study this disorder-induced localization with mean field theory and show that $W_c$ can be accurately determined by using an appropriate scaling function.

Houssem Rezgui
In recent years, phonon electron carrier dragging has emerged as an innovative approach for modulating energy transfer in low dimensional systems. In this Letter, we explore the fundamental mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling and the role of thermal lag behavior in ultrafast heat transport. We present a theoretical investigation of non-equilibrium thermal dynamics in graphene under femtosecond laser excitation, emphasizing the role of phonon branch-resolved electron phonon coupling. This framework provides new insight into ultrafast energy transfer processes at femtosecond timescales and illustrates key deviations from the predictions of the classical two temperature model (TTM), particularly in spatially localized heat transport. Our results show that a 190 fs laser pulse induces a strong non-equilibrium state, followed by momentum redistribution among the excited carriers. This is then followed by effective cooling of the carrier distribution on a 450 fs timescale through phonon emission.

Yadong Jiang, Huan Wang, Jing Wang
We theoretically propose that the van der Waals layered ternary transition metal chalcogenide FeTaX$_2$ (X = S, Se, Te) is a new family of ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulators with sizable bulk gap and Chern number C = -2. The magnetic ordering originates predominantly from the Fe atoms, where strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions between them induce magnetic moments on the Ta sites, yielding a collinear ferrimagnetic ground state. The large topological gap arises from the deep sd-type band inversion between spin-down Ta d$_{z^2}$ and d$_{xy}$ orbitals near the Fermi level-a mechanism unique to d-orbital systems. Remarkably, the Curie temperature of monolayer FeTaX$_2$ is predicted to significantly exceed that of monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Furthermore, both the Curie temperature and topological gap scale positively with the spin orbit coupling strength of the $d$ electrons, suggesting a common physical origin. These findings, if realized experimentally, could open new avenues for the research and application of topological quantum physics.

Theo A. Lewy, Suzanne M. Fielding, Peter D. Olmsted, Rich R. Kerswell
We show theoretically that an initially homogeneous planar Couette flow of a concentrated polymeric fluid is linearly unstable to the growth of two-dimensional (2D) perturbations, within two widely used constitutive models: the Johnson-Segalman model and the Rolie-Poly model. We perform direct nonlinear simulations of both models in 2D to show that this instability leads to a state of elastic turbulence comprising several narrow shear bands that dynamically coalesce, split and interact. Importantly, we show that this 2D instability arises not only in fluids that have a non-monotonic constitutive curve, and therefore show shear banding in 1D calculations, but also in shear thinning fluids with a monotonic constitutive curve, for which an initially homogeneous base state is stable in 1D. For the former category, the high shear branch of the constitutive curve is unstable to 2D instability in both models, so that the high shear band may be turbulent. In the Rolie-Poly model, the low shear branch is also likewise unstable. Our work provides the first simulation evidence for elastic turbulence in highly entangled polymeric fluids. It also potentially explains rheo-chaotic states seen experimentally in shear banding wormlike micelles. We additionally demonstrate elastic turbulence within both models in the planar Poiseuille geometry.

Wei-Lin Li, Dan-Dan Liang, Zhi Li, Xue-Jia Yu
We perform a comprehensive analytical study of the exotic quantum phases and phase transitions emerging from the cluster-Ising model with off-diagonal Gamma interactions. Specifically, we map out the ground-state phase diagram by analyzing both local and nonlocal order parameters, together with the energy spectra. The results reveal two pairs of gapped phases, namely and antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range ordered phases, symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, as well as two distinct gapless spiral phases induced by the off-diagonal interactions, which are related by a duality transformation and are numerically confirmed through the long-distance behavior of various order parameters. Remarkably, four distinct phase transition lines emerge in the phase diagram. Two of them, which separate the distinct gapped or gapless phases, are described by the Ising and three copy Ising conformal field theories, respectively. In contrast, the remaining two transition lines, between the gapless spiral and gapped phases, belong to a nonconformal Lifshitz criticality with dynamical critical exponent $z = 2$. More importantly, the intersection of these four transition lines gives rise to a new Lifshitz multicritical point exhibiting emergent conformal symmetry, marking a fundamental departure from all previously known nonconformal Lifshitz points. This work provides a valuable reference for future investigations of exotic gapless phases and their transitions in exactly solvable many-body systems.

Michalis Chatzittofi, Yuto Hosaka
We study the emergent orientational dynamics of a dumbbell dimer -- two asymmetric monomers connected by a linking spring -- in a three-dimensional chiral environment with odd viscosity. In classical systems with conserved parity symmetry, reciprocal oscillations of a dimer does not lead to rotational motion. Here, through an analytical calculation, we find that the presence of chirality in the system induces rotational dynamics as function of the expansion/contraction of the dimer. By incorporating thermal fluctuations, we further find that the rotational diffusivity is affected by the coupling between conformational fluctuations and rotational motion. Our results provide insights into problems where the parity symmetry is broken and can be used as a building block to study similar models at the collective level. These problems include multi-component molecular machines in odd-viscous fluids and systems with charged polymers where oddity is present through external magnetic fields.

We establish an information thermodynamics framework for feedback protocols that rely on temporal information. Using this framework, we show that random-time engines that appear to function as perpetuum mobile, such as stochastically stopped processes or heat engines with random-time protocols, actually satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. We illustrate the principles of temporal information thermodynamics on a random-time version of Szilard's engine, which is a paradigmatic example of a temporal information engine. Our findings quantify the thermodynamic cost of random times in external protocols, such as, in stochastic resetting protocols or in heat engines with random-time protocols.

Developing efficient single-photon sources is fundamental to advancing photonic quantum technologies. In particular, achieving scalable, cost-effective, stable, high-rate, and high-purity single-photon emission at ambient conditions is paramount for free-space quantum communication. However, fulfilling all the requirements simultaneously under ambient conditions has remained a significant challenge. Here, the scalable, cost-effective ambient condition synthesis of nickel doped (Ni doped) CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (NPQDs) is presented using a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method. The resulting individual NPQDs demonstrate remarkable photostability, sustaining their performance for over 10 minutes under ambient conditions with environment humidity of ~55%, and exhibit exceptional single-photon purity (>99%) with a narrow emission linewidth (~70 meV). The remarkable photostability could be attributed to the spatial localization of exciton by Ni atoms on the surface of the nanocrystal, reducing its interaction with the environment. Our results demonstrated that NPQDs with outstanding combinations of quantum emitting properties can be both synthesized and operated at ambient conditions. These findings mark a significant step toward scalable, cost-effective quantum light sources for real-world applications, paving the way for robust quantum communication systems and devices.

Hagfish slime is a unique biological material composed of mucus and protein threads that rapidly deploy into a cohesive network when deployed in seawater. The forces involved in thread deployment and interactions among mucus and threads are key to understanding how hagfish slime rapidly assembles into a cohesive, functional network. Despite extensive interest in its biophysical properties, the mechanical forces governing thread deployment and interaction remain poorly quantified. Here, we present the first direct in situ measurements of the micromechanical forces involved in hagfish slime formation, including mucus mechanical properties, skein peeling force, thread-mucus adhesion, and thread-thread cohesion. Using a custom glass-rod force sensing system, we show that thread deployment initiates when peeling forces exceed a threshold of approximately 6.8 nN. To understand the flow strength required for unraveling, we used a rheo-optic setup to impose controlled shear flow, enabling us to directly observe unraveling dynamics and determine the critical shear rate for unraveling of the skeins, which we then interpreted using an updated peeling-based force balance model. Our results reveal that thread-mucus adhesion dominates over thread-thread adhesion and that deployed threads contribute minimally to bulk shear rheology at constant flow rate. These findings clarify the physics underlying the rapid, flow-triggered assembly of hagfish slime and inform future designs of synthetic deployable fiber-gel systems.

The conventional distinction between semiconductors and insulators is often based on the magnitude of the band gap, with materials exhibiting gaps wider than 3 eV typically classified as insulators. However, the emergence of ultra-wide-band-gap (UWBG) semiconductors such as AlGaN, diamond, BN, and Ga2O3 challenges this paradigm for materials classification and raises fundamental questions about the upper bound of band gaps compatible with semiconducting behavior. Here we develop a computational-discovery strategy to identify semiconductors with band gaps exceeding that of AlN (6.2 eV), while retaining essential semiconducting properties such as shallow dopants and mobile charge carriers. We discover that materials composed of light elements in densely packed crystal structures exhibit wide band gaps and light carrier effective masses that enable shallow dopants, high mobility, and weak polaron binding. By applying the hydrogenic Bohr model and first-principles defect calculations - validated against available experimental data - to screen for materials with shallow dopants, we identify dopable compounds with gaps as wide as 9.5 eV that nonetheless host mobile charge carriers. Our findings demonstrate that semiconducting behavior persists even at extreme band gaps, far beyond conventional upper bounds traditionally associated with semiconductor materials.

Christopher Lane
Driven by the need to understand and determine the presence of non-trivial superconductivity in real candidate materials, we present a generalized set of self-consistent Gorkov-Hedin equations in a vibrating lattice with spin dependent electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. This extends Hedin's original equations to treat quantum many-body systems where electronic and lattice correlations along with relativistic effects coexist on the same footing. Upon iterating this set of equations, the corresponding spin-dependent GW approximation and generalized ladder approximations are constructed.

Y. M. Cho, Franklin H. Cho
We discuss three different but closely related theories which could describe varieties of condensed matters, in particular the frustrated magnetic materials and the multi-gap (ferro)magnetic superconductors with or without the photon-magnon mixing, where the genuine non-Abelian magnon gauge interaction plays the central role. The charactristic features of these theories are the existence of long range magnetic order and the spin-spin interaction described by the exchange of the messenger bosons, not by the instantaneous action at a distance. These theories could play important roles in our understanding of non-Abelian condensed matters and make the non-Abelian gauge interaction a main stream in the low energy physics. We discuss the physical implications of our results.

G. I. Martone, G. V. Shlyapnikov
We consider a traveling supersolid stripe pattern in a spin-orbit-coupled Bose gas. This configuration is associated with an unequal occupation of the two single-particle energy minima, giving rise to a chemical potential difference that sets the fringe velocity. Unlike stationary stripes, the moving pattern is spin-polarized, with decreasing contrast as momentum increases, eventually leading to stripe melting and transition to the uniform plane-wave phase. The Bogoliubov spectrum of the moving stripes exhibits asymmetry under inversion of the excitation quasimomentum. At high momentum, we identify energetic and dynamical instabilities in the spin-phonon mode which transforms to the roton mode of the plane-wave phase as the stripe structure vanishes.

Marco Seiz, Tomohiro Takaki
In recent years high heating rate sintering methods have become a hot topic for reasons of energy efficiency and microstructural optimization. This paper aims to shed light on the microstructural evolution these methods induce by means of phase-field modeling and simulations. A particle-based temperature model suited for the sintering process is developed and coupled with a multiphysics phase-field solver. It is shown that the coupled model exhibits many characteristics typical of high heating rate sintering. Furthermore, the occurrence of temperature and microstructural inhomogeneity as well as their interplay is simulatively explored.

Chengyu Yan, Huai Guan, Zhenyu Zhang, Yiheng Sun, Qiao Chen, Xinming Zhao, Chuanwen Zhao, James Jun He, Shun Wang
The discovery of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) has been cherished as a milestone in developing superconducting electronics. Tremendous efforts are being dedicated to realizing SDE in a wide variety of material platforms. Despite the diversity in the hosting materials and device designs, SDE is usually operated in a single mode which is enabled by either out-of-plane or in-plane magnetic field/magnetization. In this work, we report the realization of a dual-mode SDE in 2H-$\mathrm{NbS_2}$/2H-$\mathrm{NbSe_2}$ heterostructures where both the out-of-plane magnetic field $B_{\perp}$ and in-plane magnetic field $B_{||}$ can independently generate and manipulate SDE. The two modes share similar diode efficiency but differ in two aspects: 1. $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE is activated by a field on the order of 1 mT while $B_{||}$-induced SDE requires a field on the order of 100 mT; 2. $\eta$ of $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE exhibits a square-root like temperature dependence while $\eta$ of $B_{||}$-induced SDE takes a more linear-like one. We demonstrate that the dual-mode SDE is most likely a result of mirror symmetry breaking along multiple orientations. Thanks to the two orders difference in the operational field for the two modes, we propose a dual-functionality device scheme to showcase the potential of the dual-mode SDE in realizing advanced superconducting architecture, where fast polarity-switching functionality is implemented with $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE and high-fidelity functionality is enabled with $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE.

[54]. [*What holes in superconductors reveal about superconductivity*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07361 "What holes in superconductors reveal about superconductivity")
J. E. Hirsch
We consider a type I superconducting body that contains one or more holes in its interior that undergoes a transition between normal and superconducting states in the presence of a magnetic field. We argue that unlike other thermodynamic systems that undergo first order phase transitions the system cannot reach its equilibrium thermodynamic state, and that this sheds new light on the physics of the Meissner effect. How the Meissner effect occurs has not been addressed within the conventional theory of superconductivity, BCS. The situation considered in this paper indicates that expulsion of magnetic field requires physical elements absent from Hamiltonians assumed to describe superconductors within BCS theory. These physical elements are essential components of the alternative theory of hole superconductivity.

[55]. [*Scaling up the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07441 "Scaling up the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group")
Benjamin Corbett, Akimasa Miyake
Explicitly correlated methods, such as the transcorrelated method which shifts a Jastrow or Gutzwiller correlator from the wave function to the Hamiltonian, are designed for high-accuracy calculations of electronic structures, but their application to larger systems has been hampered by the computational cost. We develop improved techniques for the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), in which the ground state of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is represented as a matrix product state (MPS), and demonstrate large-scale calculations of the ground-state energy of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Our developments stem from three technical inventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated Hamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the entanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS representation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller correlator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated method. We examine systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ lattice sites, four times larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that transcorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard non-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort. Transcorrelated DMRG reduces the error of the ground state energy by $3\times$-$17 \times$, with the smallest improvement seen for a small system at half-filling and the largest improvement in a dilute closed-shell system.

Yahui Zhai, Longju Yu, Jian Lv, Wei Zhang, Hong Jian Zhao
Recently, altermagnetic materials have become rather attractive because such materials showcase combined advantages of ferromagnets (e.g., spin current) and antiferromagnets (e.g., low stray field and ultrafast spin dynamics). Symmetry arguments imply that d-wave altermagnets may host strain-induced nonrelativistic Zeeman-type spin splittings (ZSSs), but a theoretical, numerical, and experimental justification remains lacking. In the present work, we work with collinear spin point groups (SPGs) and use symmetry analysis to identify 15 SPGs that host strain-induced nonrelativistic ZSSs. These 15 SPGs coincide with the cases associated with d-wave altermagnetic spin splittings reported in literature. We further corroborate our analysis by first-principles numerical simulations, which indicate that a shear strain of 2% creates sizable nonrelativistic ZSSs of up to 177, 100, and 102 meV in CoF2, LiFe2F6 and La2O3Mn2Se2 d-wave altermagnetic semiconductors, respectively. Our work suggests an alternative route toward creating spin current in altermagnets, which may be used to design altermagnetic-based spintronic devices.

Graphene nanoislands (GNIs) are one of the promising building blocks for quantum devices owing to their unique potential. However, direct electrical measurements of GNIs have been challenging due to the requirement of metal catalysts in typical synthesis methods. In this study, we demonstrate electrical transport measurements of GNIs by using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition, which is a catalyst-free method to deposit graphene directly on SiO$_2$ substrates. This approach enables the fabrication of metal electrodes on GNIs, allowing us to measure their quantum transport properties. At low temperatures, one of our devices shows clear Coulomb diamonds with twofold degeneracy, indicating the formation of quantum dots and the vanishing of valley degeneracy. The charge state of the GNI is also modulated by a local side gate, and the tunneling coupling between leads and quantum dots is modulated by changing contact area and metal materials. These results provide device design guidelines toward GNI-based quantum devices for next-generation computing.

Xiangwen Wang, Yihao Wei, Anupam Bhattacharya, Qian Yang, Artem Mishchenko
Flat electronic bands enhance electron-electron interactions and give rise to correlated states such as unconventional superconductivity or fractional topological phases. However, most current efforts towards flat-band materials discovery rely on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and manual band structures inspection, restraining their applicability to vast unexplored material spaces. While data-driven methods offer a scalable alternative, most existing models either depend on band structure inputs or focus on scalar properties like bandgap, which fail to capture flat-band characteristics. Here, we report a structure-informed framework for the discovery of previously unrecognized flat-band two-dimensional (2D) materials, which combines a data-driven flatness score capturing both band dispersion and density-of-states characteristics with multi-modal learning from atomic structure inputs. The framework successfully identified multiple flat-band candidates, with DFT validation of kagome-based systems confirming both band flatness and topological character. Our results show that the flatness score provides a physically meaningful signal for identifying flat bands from atomic geometry. The framework uncovers multiple new candidates with topologically nontrivial flat bands from unlabeled data, with consistent model performance across structurally diverse materials. By eliminating the need for precomputed electronic structures, our method enables large-scale screening of flat-band materials and expands the search space for discovering strongly correlated quantum materials.

Inspired by the recent discovery of breathing kagome materials \(\rm Nb_3Cl_8\) and \(\rm Nb_3TeCl_7\), we have explored the influence of the breathing effect on the Hubbard model of the kagome lattice. Utilizing the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we first investigated the average sign problem in the breathing kagome lattice, which is significantly affected by both the breathing strength and the interaction strength. Secondly, we calculated the electronic kinetic energy, the direct current conductivity, and the electronic density of states at the Fermi level to determine the critical interaction strength for the metal-insulator transition. Our results indicate that the breathing effect, in conjunction with the interaction strength, drives the kagome system from a metal to an insulator. Finally, we evaluated the magnetic properties and constructed a phase diagram incorporating both transport and magnetic properties. The phase diagram reveals that as the interaction strength increases, the system transitions from a paramagnetic metal to a Mott insulator. Our research provides a theoretical guidance for utilizing the breathing effect to control the band gaps, conductivity, and magnetic properties of kagome materials with electronic interactions.

Intercalation has proven to be a powerful tool for tailoring the electronic properties of freestanding graphene layers as well as for stabilizing the intercalated material in a two-dimensional configuration. This work examines Si intercalation of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) using three preparation methods. Dangling bond states at the interface were found to undergo a Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition as a result of a significant on-site repulsion. Comparing this heterostructure consisting of graphene and a Mott insulator with a similar system without graphene, reveals the screening ability of graphene's conduction electrons on the on-site repulsion. The system presented here can serve as a template for further research on Mott insulators with variable band gap.

Jun Usami, Yuki Okamoto, Hisashi Inoue, Takeshi Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Yamada
Solid-state cooling and energy harvesting via pyroelectric effect (PEE) and electrocaloric effect (ECE) in ferroelectric thin films could be enhanced beyond their intrinsic ferroelectric response by exploiting the recently observed direction-dependent enhancement of the PEE; however, its microscopic origin remains unknown. Herein, we report direct hysteresis measurements of pyrocurrent ($I_{\rm p}$) and ECE-induced temperature change versus bias voltage in 1-$\mu$m-thick Pb(Zr$_{0.65}$Ti$_{0.35}$)O$_3$ capacitors. Both hysteresis loops exhibit pronounced asymmetries along the voltage and response axes. By superimposing direct current voltage offsets, we isolate a residual $I_{\rm p}$-axis shift, revealing a contribution of non-switchable ferroelectric polarization. This non-switchable polarization can be converted into switchable polarization via poling with bipolar triangular pulses, confirming the governing role of defect-induced domain pinning. After 100 pulses, time-dependent aging was observed for pyroelectric and electrocaloric responses, with the switchable contribution markedly decaying and the non-switchable component remaining nearly constant, indicating partial repinning. The change in voltage-axis shift agrees well with the ratio of non-switchable to switchable polarization, demonstrating that voltage shift also arises from pinned domains. These insights clarify the critical role of non-switchable polarization in the PEE and ECE performance, suggesting strategies to optimize the directional response in ferroelectric devices through controlled poling and defect engineering.

Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have successfully demonstrated scaling behavior, i.e. the power-law improvement in training performance, however the emergence of novel capabilities at scale remains unexplored. We have developed Edge-wise Emergent Decomposition (E3D) framework to investigate how an MLIP develops the ability to derive physically meaningful local representations of chemical bonds without explicit supervision. Employing an E(3)-equivariant network (Allegro) trained on molecular data (SPICE~2), we found that the trained MLIP spontaneously learned representations of bond dissociation energy (BDE) by decomposing the global potential energy landscape. The learned BDE values quantitatively agree with literature and its scalability are found to be robust across diverse training datasets, suggesting the presence of underlying representation that captures chemical reactions faithfully beyond given training information. Our E3D analysis utilizing Shannon's entropy reveals a close interplay between the decomposability of potential energy learning, scalability of learning, and emergent chemical reactivity, thus providing novel insights of scaling limitations and pathways toward more physically interpretable and predictive simulations.

The spin Hall effect (SHE) enables efficient electrical manipulation of magnetization through the spin Hall current \left(\mathbit{J}_{\mathbit{SHE}}\right), advancing energy-efficient spintronics. In parallel, the orbital Hall effect (OHE) offers an alternative pathway to SHE for converting charge current into an angular momentum flow. In this study, we demonstrate field-free current-induced perpendicular ferrimagnetic deterministic switching within a Mo/CoGd device without an additional orbital-to-spin conversion layer. This is achieved by harnessing localized orbital Hall currents \left(\mathbit{J}_{\mathbit{OHE}}\right) generated in the Mo layer. The in-plane symmetry breaking at the Mo/CoGd surface-interface layer, validated by a pronounced planar Hall effect, gives rise to a substantial unconventional z-polarized damping-like torque. The CoGd serves a dual role: not only as a converter that transforms the significant \mathbit{J}_{\mathbit{OHE}} into \mathbit{J}_{\mathbit{SHE}} but also as a ferrimagnetic self-switching mechanism. This dual functionality enables highly efficient field-free current-induced magnetization switching with a critical current density as low as \mathbf{2}.\mathbf{51}\ \times{\mathbf{10}}^\mathbf{6} A cm-2. Our work highlights the potential of orbital Hall currents for energy-efficient magnetization switching, making a notable contribution to the burgeoning field of orbitronics.

We develop a phenomenological theory describing the interaction of superconducting condensate with a Bessel beam of twisted light characterized by a nonzero angular momentum $m$. Starting from the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model with the complex relaxation time we calculate the spatial profiles of dc photoinduced currents and magnetic fields as well as the second harmonic response. The photocurrents and magnetic fileds are shown to be determined both by the helicity of light and its orbital momentum $m$. Analyzing the half-space and thin film geometries we discuss possible experimental tests aimed to probe the superconducting photocurrents and magnetic fields.

Jakob Metson, Saeed Osat, Ramin Golestanian
Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. While we also observe our predicted instability in discrete-time simulations for small system sizes, discrete-time simulations of large systems show stability in the discrepant region even for long simulation times. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.

Jakob Metson, Saeed Osat, Ramin Golestanian
In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.

Saikat Banerjee, Stephan Humeniuk
We study the effects of magnon-magnon interactions in the two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr$_3$ focusing on its honeycomb lattice structure. Motivated by earlier theoretical predictions of temperature-induced spectral shifts and van Hove singularities in the magnon dispersion~\cite{PhysRevX.8.011010}, we go beyond the commonly used thermal magnon approximation by applying second-order perturbation theory in a fully numerical framework. Our analysis uncovers significant deviations from previous analysis: in particular, the predicted singularities are absent, consistent with recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements~\cite{PhysRevLett.129.127201}. Moreover, we find that the temperature dependence of the renormalized magnon spectrum exhibits a distinct $T^3$ behavior for the optical magnon branch, while retaining $T^2$ behavior for the acoustic or down magnon band. This feature sheds new light on the collective dynamics of Dirac magnons and their interactions. We further compare the honeycomb case with a triangular Bravais lattice, relevant for ferromagnetic monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, and show that both systems lack singular features while displaying quite distinct thermal trends.

The integration of ferroelectric and topological materials offers a promising avenue for advancing the development of quantum material devices. In this work, we explore the strong coupling between topological states and ferroelectricity in the heterostructure formed by interfacing MnBi2Te4 (MBT) thin films and monolayer In2Te3. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the polarization direction in In2Te3 can strongly alter electronic band structures in the MBT/In2Te3 heterostructure, and even induces a topological phase transition between quantum anomalous Hall (C = 1) and trivial (C = 0) insulating states, originating from the change of band order induced by the switch of out-of-plane polarization. Our work highlights the promising potential of ferroelectric-topological heterostructures in aiding the development of reconfigurable quantum devices, and creating new possibilities for progress in advanced microelectronic and spintronic systems

S W Lovesey
A material in possession of localized 4f-electron magnetism and delocalized 3d-electron or band magnetism can often present enigmatic physical phenomena, and there has been a longstanding interest in the kagome metal YbFe6Ge6. More recently, because of an investigation of a so-called anomalous Hall effect, or topological Hall effect, underpinned by a thorough study of its magnetic structures using neutron diffraction and single crystals [W. Yao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 186501 (2025)]. The authors endorse a magnetic structure of Fe ions in the low temperature phase originally mis-reported in their diffraction patterns. The orthorhombic magnetic space group inferred from the endorsed structure is P(parity)T(time)-symmetric (anti-inversion (-1') a linear magneto-electric, like an altermagnet. Calculated Bragg diffraction patterns for future x-ray and neutron experiments are rich in Fe magnetic properties of orthorhombic YbFe6Ge6, including space-spin correlations, anapoles and Dirac quadrupoles familiar in high-Tc ceramic superconductors. Iron moments in the two-dimensional layers of a hexagonal nuclear structure undergo collinear antiferromagnetic order below a temperature = 500 K. The moments depart from the c axis in a spontaneous transition at = 63 K to an orthorhombic structure. The magnetism of Yb ions appears to behave independently, which can be confirmed using resonant x-ray diffraction enhanced by an Fe atomic resonance.

Anna Sitek, Sigurdur I. Erlingsson, Andrei Manolescu
We theoretically study the spin-orbit interaction in the outer regions of core-shell nanowires that can act as tubular, prismatic conductors. The polygonal cross section of these wires induces non-uniform electron localization along the wire perimeter. In particular, low-energy electrons accumulate in the corner regions, and in the case of narrow shells, conductive channels form along the sharp edges. In contrast, higher-energy electrons are shifted toward the facets. These two groups of states may be separated by large energy gaps, which can exceed the room-temperature energy in the case of triangular geometries. We compare the impact of spin-orbit interaction on the corner and side states of hexagonal and triangular shells grown on hexagonal cores as well as on triangular shells grown on triangular cores. We find that the spin-orbit splitting, and thus the degeneracy of energy states at finite wave vectors, strongly depends on the tube's geometry. We demonstrate that the weak spin-orbit coupling observed in clean wires can be significantly enhanced if the intermixing of core and shell materials takes place. Moreover, we show that the energy spectrum in the presence of spin-orbit interaction allows for estimating the interaction between states and shows that triangular shells can act as three independent wires in the low-energy regime, while they behave as interacting systems at higher energy ranges.

Anna Chmiel, Julian Sienkiewicz
We consider a coupled system mimicking opinion formation under the influence of a group of $q$ neighbors ($q$-lobby) that consists of an Ising part governed by temperature-like parameter $T$ and a voter dynamics parameterized by noise probability $p$ (independence of choice). Using rigorous analytical calculations backed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the interplay between these two quantities. Based on the theory of phase transitions, we derive the relation between $T$ and $p$ at the critical line dividing the ordered and disordered phases, which takes a very simple and generic form $T(p-a)=b$ in the high temperature limit. For specific lobby sizes, we show where the temperature are noise are balanced, and we hint that for large $q$, the temperature-like dynamics prevails.

The magnetic spin dynamics and optical properties of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ are studied. Single crystals grown by the Sn-flux method crystallize in the $P\overline{3}m1$ (No.~164) space group and order antiferromagnetically at $T_N=23.5$~K. $^{151}$Eu M\"ossbauer spectroscopy confirms the presence of the Eu$^{2+}$ oxidation state only and the magnetic moment angle relative to the $c$-axis is $\theta=46(3)$\textdegree. Temperature-dependent electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements reveal that spin-spin interactions predominantly govern the spin relaxation mechanisms, as evidenced by the linewidth behavior ($\Delta H$). Positive $g$-shifts ($\Delta g)$ for $H \parallel ab$ indicate the presence of local electron polarization. The ESR data support the formation of anisotropic magnetic polarons, which trap spin carriers and contribute to increased electrical resistance. Angular-dependent ESR spectra at room temperature display anisotropic behavior in both $\Delta g(\phi)$ and $\Delta H(\phi)$, with a dominant three-dimensional component $C_{3D}$, indicative of robust interlayer coupling and antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Under light illumination, a small broadening of $\Delta H$ is observed. Furthermore, a photovoltaic effect is identified in EuZn$_2$P$_2$, with photodetector performance metrics suggesting promising capabilities for future optoelectronic devices.

Po-Shen Hsin
Symmetries are important guiding principle for phase transitions. We systematically construct field theory models with local quantum fields that exhibit the following phase transitions: (1) different symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with generalized symmetries; (2) different symmetry enriched topological (SET) phases with generalized symmetries differ by symmetry fractionalizations; (3) spontaneously broken generalized symmetries, where the unbroken phases can have nontrivial SPT or SET. The models are ordinary gauge theories with bosons or fermions in 3+1d and 2+1d. We focus on one-form symmetries and symmetries generated by condensation defects, which do not act on local operators. The phase transitions are protected from local operator perturbations which do not change the asymptotic phases. In particular, we show that continuous gauge theories in 3+1d can have different phases distinguished by fractionalizations of unbroken one-form symmetries.

Altermagnets combine antiferromagnetic order with ferromagnet-like spin splitting, a duality that unlocks ultrafast spin-dependent responses. This unique property creates unprecedented opportunities for spin-current generation, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of conventional spin-transfer and spin-orbit torque approaches in magnetic memory technologies. Here, we establish a fundamental relationship between Fermi surface geometry and time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin currents in altermagnets through combined model analysis and first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that a $d$-wave altermagnet with a flat Fermi surface can achieve a theoretical upper limit of charge-to-spin conversion efficiency (CSE) of 100%. This mechanism is realized in the newly discovered room-temperature altermagnetic metal KV$_2$O$_2$Se, which exhibits a CSE of $\sim$78% at the charge neutrality point, nearly double that of RuO$_2$, setting a new record for $\mathcal{T}$-odd CSE. Under electron doping, this efficiency further increases to $\sim$98%, approaching the theoretical limit. Our work advances the fundamental understanding of $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin currents via Fermi surface geometry engineering and provides key insights for developing next-generation altermagnet-based memory devices.

The 6H-perovskite Ba3RRu2O9 (R = rare-earth), composed of Ru2O9 dimers connected through RO6 octahedra, exhibits an intriguing variety of magnetic ground states, ranging from non-magnetic to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, depending on the specific R ion. In this study, we investigate the compound Ba3TbRu2O9 using magnetic susceptibility measurements and time-of-flight neutron diffraction experiments. Our combined bulk and microscopic analyses reveal that the Tb4+ (4f7) electronic configuration results in an s-like state with an orbital moment L=0 and spin-only value of S=7/2, and Ru4+ exhibits a spin-only value of S=1 despite the presence of strong spin-lattice coupling in this compound, representing a sharp contrast to other reported members of this family. A cooperative 4d-4f spin ordering is observed below the Neel temperature (around 9.5 K), indicating strong Ru(4d)=Tb(4f) correlations in the system. The Tb-moments order antiferromagnetically in the bc-plane, whereas the Ru-moments are aligned antiferromagnetically along the b-axis. Furthermore, a collinear antiferromagnetic arrangement of spins is observed within the Ru2O9 dimers throughout the structure, unlike other reported members of this series (e.g., Ho and Nd).

Philip A. Thomas, William P. Wardley, William L. Barnes
Surface polaritons (SPs) are electromagnetic waves bound to a surface through their interaction with charge carriers in the surface material. Hyperbolic SPs can be supported by optically anisotropic materials where the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivies have opposite signs. Here we report what we believe to be the first experimental study of hyperbolic surface exciton polaritons (HSEPs). We study the intensity and phase response of HSEPs in the J-aggregate TDBC (a type-II natural hyperbolic material). HSEPs can be used to generate phase singularities; the behaviour of these phase singularities is a consequence of the hyperbolic nature of TDBC. The combined intensity and phase response of non-hyperbolic and hyperbolic SPs suggests that they are topologically distinct. We predict analogous effects for hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride. Our work suggests that organic materials can provide a new platform for the exploration of hyperbolic surface polaritonics at visible frequencies.

Kazuki Oi, Shimpei Endo
We study the Efimov states in highly mass-imbalanced three-body systems composed of two identical heavy atoms and one light atom, focusing on the Er-Er-Li and Dy-Dy-Li cold-atom mixtures with strong dipole-dipole interactions between the heavy atoms. By solving the Born-Oppenheimer equation for varying $s$-wave scattering lengths between the heavy and light atoms, we demonstrate for both bosonic and fermionic systems that the Efimov spectra and hence the three-body parameters are universal even with the dipole interaction comparable in strength to the van der Waals interaction. While the bosonic systems exhibit Efimov states only in the $M_z=0$ channel, the fermionic systems show a characteristic doublet of the Efimov states in the $M_z=0$ and $M_z = \pm 1$ channels due to the interplay of finite angular momentum and the anisotropy of the dipole interaction. Both numerical results and analytical formula obtained with the first-order perturbation show that the ratio of the three-body parameters between these two fermionic channels exhibits universality, particularly well in the limit of large mass imbalance. Leveraging this universality, we provide quantitative predictions for the values and ratios of the three-body parameters for experimentally relevant Er-Li and Dy-Li isotopes.

The discovery of $T_c\sim 80$~K superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has launched a new platform to study high-temperature superconductivity. Using non-perturbative dynamic cluster approximation quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we characterize the magnetic and superconducting pairing behavior of a realistic bilayer two-orbital Hubbard-Hund model of this system that describes the relevant Ni $e_g$ states with physically relevant interaction strengths. We find a leading $s^\pm$ superconducting instability in this model and show that this state primarily arises from interlayer pairing in the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital that is driven by strong interlayer spin-fluctuations in that orbital. These results provide non-perturbative evidence supporting the picture that a simple single-orbital bilayer Hubbard model for the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital provides an excellent low-energy effective description of the superconducting behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Lingfeng Piao, Anne Juel
We present a scalable method for producing monodisperse microscale emulsions in a container holding two stably stratified layers of immiscible liquids by applying horizontal vibration. Our experiments and theoretical modelling show that the critical non-dimensional acceleration for regular droplet formation is governed by a shear-dominated breakup mechanism, which scales as $N^{-1/2} \omega^{*3/2}$, where $N$ is the viscosity ratio and $\omega^{*}$ is the frequency of forcing on the viscous-capillary scale. The droplet diameter can be easily controlled by varying the forcing parameters, thus demonstrating this vibrational configuration as a scalable alternative to microfluidics.

Optically addressable spin impurities in crystals along with device engineering provide an attractive route to realizing quantum technologies in the solid state, but reconciling disparate emitter and host material constraints for a given target application is often challenging. Rare-earth ions in two-dimensional (2D) materials could mitigate this problem given the atomic-like transitions of the emitters and the versatile nature of van der Waals systems. Here we combine ion implantation, confocal microscopy, and ab-initio calculations to examine the photon emission of Er-doped WS2 flakes. Optical spectroscopy reveals narrow, long-lived photo-luminescence lines in the telecom band, which we activate after low-temperature thermal annealing. Spectroscopic and polarization-selective measurements show a uniform response across the ensemble, while the fluorescence brightness remains mostly unchanged with temperature, suggesting non-radiative relaxation channels are inefficient. Our results create opportunities for novel solid state devices coupling 2D-hosted, telecom-band emitters to photonic heterostructures separately optimized for photon manipulation.

[81]. [*Anomalous diffusion and directed coalescence of condensates in driven media*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07753 "Anomalous diffusion and directed coalescence of condensates in driven media")
Andriy Goychuk
The formation of domains via phase transitions is ubiquitous across physical systems from metallic alloys to biomolecular condensates in cells. We show that when the boundaries between such domains are forced to move, for example by external electrical fields or concentration gradients, this motion internally generates dipole force fields. This translation-induced polarization leads to emergent dipole-dipole interactions that drive directed coalescence of domains, even in the absence of Brownian motion. We then ask how the stochastic motion of individual condensates is driven by active and passive stresses in viscoelastic media such as the cell cytoplasm. Our analysis reveals that active stirring can suppress or enhance the size dependence of diffusion. Together, these findings shed new light on the dynamics of condensates in viscoelastic media and conserved order parameters in general.

Kostas Fykouras, Linn Leppert
Reducing the dimensionality of metal-halide perovskites enhances quantum and dielectric confinement, enabling tunable excitonic properties. In one dimension, the arrangement of metal-halide octahedra in chains with corner-, edge-, or face-sharing connectivity allows for additional structural flexibility. This not only expands material design possibilities but also reflects quasi-one-dimensional motifs that arise during perovskite formation but are poorly understood. Using first-principles many-body perturbation theory within the $GW$ and Bethe-Salpeter Equation framework, we provide a comprehensive picture of how one-dimensional confinement, octahedral connectivity and dielectric screening affect optical absorption and exciton photophysics in these materials. Our calculations reveal that increasing octahedral connectivity leads to increased exciton binding and complex, anisotropic optical signatures. However, in experimental compounds, pronounced dielectric screening effects can shift exciton binding energies by several hundred meV, altering these trends. These findings offer insights and design principles for excitonic properties, and aid the interpretation of optical experiments on one-dimensional perovskites.

We critically reexamine the superconducting properties of rock-salt transition-metal carbides (TMCs), often regarded as textbook conventional superconductors, combining first-principles electron-phonon calculations with variable-composition evolutionary structure prediction. Studying superconducting trends across the entire transition-metal series, we find that, when the rock-salt stoichiometric phase is dynamically or thermodynamically unstable, carbon-vacant structures identified through unbiased structure prediction permit to reconcile theoretical calculations with experimental trends. Our integrated use of structure prediction and electron-phonon calculations defines a general framework for realistic modelling of superconductors shaped by non-equilibrium synthesis routes and defect tolerance.

In spite of a large quantity of papers devoted to the mangetoluminescence from CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te, quantum wells there have been no attempts to analyze it on the basis of the band-structure calculations. This has been proposed in the present paper. Samples containing one or ten CdTe quantum wells with Cd$_{0.7}$Mg$_{0.3}$Te barriers are grown by a molecular beam epitaxy on a semi-insulating GaAs substrate. Each well is modulation-doped with iodine donors which leads to the creation of a two-dimensional electron gas in the wells. Polarization-resolved ($\sigma^+/\sigma^-$) photoluminescence spectra are measured at liquid helium temperatures and magnetic fields up to 9 T. The results are interpreted on the basis of calculations of the energy of Landau levels in the conduction and valence bands. In the latter case, we use the Luttinger Hamiltonian while the conduction band is described within a three-level k$\cdot$p model. Both models, originally formulated for bulk materials, are adapted for two-dimensional structures. We have found that the majority of all observed transitions is well reproducede by this theory. However, some strong transitions are not which allows us to propose an enlarged scheme of selection rules of the photoluminescence transitions resulting from mixing of the conduction and valence bands. We observe transitions involving Landau levels in the valence band with the index up to 7. To understand the origin of occupation with photoexcited holes of these levels, lying deep in the valence band, we carry out time-resolved measurements which show that the photoexcited barrier is a source of long-lived holes tunneling into the quantum wells. Calculations of the conduction band electron effective g-factor show its strong variation with the electron's energy and the external magnetic field.

We systematically investigate the influence of polyvinyl formal (PVFM), commonly known as Formvar, in comparison to polycarbonate (PC) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), as encapsulation materials on the strain performance of MoS2 monolayer and bilayer flakes on flexible polypropylene (PP) substrates. Notably, optical differential reflectance measurements reveal that PVFM and PMMA encapsulation significantly enhances the mechanical and thermal strain gauge factors by approximately 2-fold (up to ~-50 meV/%) and 6-fold (up to ~-1.5 meV/{\deg}C), respectively, while PC shows a slightly lower enhancement. Moreover, all three polymers increase the maximum achievable strain from approximately 1.4% to 2.3%. Furthermore, devices fabricated on PP substrates exhibit improved optoelectronic performance when encapsulated with PVFM, including increased and faster photocurrent response and extended device lifetime.

Ayan Pal, Erik G. C. P. van Loon, Ferdi Aryasetiawan
Nonequilibrium quantum physics greatly simplifies in the case of time-periodic Hamiltonians, since Floquet theory provides an analogue to Bloch's theorem in the time domain. Still, the formal properties of Floquet many-body theory remain underexplored. Here, we develop linear response theory for Floquet systems, in the sense that we have a time-periodic potential of arbitrary strength and a perturbatively small but non-periodic probing field. As an application, we derive the analogy of Fermi's Golden Rule and the photoemission spectrum of a many-electron system. As in the equilibrium case, the latter is related to the spectral function which is positive definite. We also analyze the parameter dependence of the controllable photoemission spectra by virtue of Floquet engineering.

Naoki Morishita, Kenshin Komatsu, Motoharu Kitatani, Koichi Kusakabe
A family of nanographene molecules called phenalenyl-tessellation molecules (PTMs) exhibits two types of zero modes: a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ type that spreads over the entire molecule and a vacancy-localized type. A periodic system of PTMs is expected to have low-energy bands that strongly reflect the properties of the zero modes of PTMs as effective atoms. In this study, we show that the low-energy Dirac bands in a class of honeycomb PTMs (H-PTM) can be represented by an effective honeycomb model which is determined only by the connections between neighboring effective atoms.The hopping parameters of H-PTM in each direction take positive integer ratios according to the connection order between two PTMs.By structurally designing each PTM, we can change the connection order of the PTMs and hence modulate the energy gap and the Fermi velocity of the Dirac band of the H-PTM. Moreover, we confirm that Dirac bands coexist with vacancy-localized zero modes in the H-PTM with vacancies.The result indicates that the nanographene structure arranging PTMs as effective atoms extends material design freedom that effectively generates a modulated Dirac electron system with coexisting localized electron spins for graphene-based electronic and quantum devices.

Stefano Americo, Ivano E. Castelli, Kristian S. Thygesen
A key challenge for computational discovery of electrocatalytic materials is the reliable prediction of thermodynamic stability in aqueous environment and under different electrochemical conditions. In this work, we first evaluate the electrochemical stability of more than 3000 two-dimensional (2D) materials using conventional Pourbaix diagrams (CPDs). Due to the complete neglect of thermodynamic barriers along the (often complex) reaction pathways, the vast majority of the materials are predicted to be unstable even though some are known to be stable in practice. We then introduce an analysis based on the surface Pourbaix diagram (SPD) including 'early intermediate states' that represent the first steps of the key surface passivation and dissolution reactions. The SPD framework is applied to the 2D materials MoS$_2$, phosphorene, and the MXene Ti$_2$C, all of which are predicted to be unstable by the CPD. For MoS$_2$, our approach reproduces the experimental pH-U stability window as well as the experimental desulphurization potential. For phosphorene and Ti2$_C$, the SPD approach is used to investigate the spontaneous degradation mechanism and the potential-dependent surface termination, respectively, again yielding good agreement with experiments. The SPD-based stability analysis emerges as a versatile and quantitative method for prediction of stability and investigation of surface structures in electrochemical environments.

M. R. Norman
Recent work has shown novel properties of twisted cuprates. In this paper, I point out that related phenomena occur intrinsically in bismuth-based cuprate superconductors due to the presence of the BiO supermodulation. As the ratio of the supermodulation potential to the superconducting energy gap increases, two critical points are found where semi-Dirac nodes form (that is, that have quadratic dispersion in one direction and liner dispersion in the orthogonal direction). The first critical point should be realized in Bi2212, the second in Bi2201. Implications of these findings are discussed.

M. R. Norman
This paper presents a Landau treatment of the incommensurate density wave transition observed in trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates and uses this to address the nature of the transition. The data are consistent with a spin driven transition with the distinct intertwining of charge and spin order due to being in or proximate to the first order transition region of the Landau phase diagram. From this approach, one also obtains an understanding of the variation of the transition temperature with rare earth size, pressure, and oxygen isotope substitution.

Marcin Piotr Pruszczyk, Davide Venturelli, Andrea Gambassi
We study the stochastic dynamics of a Brownian particle after it is suddenly released from a harmonic trap moving with constant velocity through a fluctuating correlated medium, described by a scalar Gaussian field with relaxational dynamics and in contact with a thermal bath. We show that, after the release, the particle exhibits recoil, i.e., it moves in the direction opposite to the drag. As expected, this effect vanishes if the field equilibrates instantaneously. The final value of the average position of the particle is reached algebraically in time in the case of conserved dynamics of the field or for non-conserved dynamics at the critical point. Our predictions are expected to be relevant, at least qualitatively, to driven colloidal particles in liquid media close to critical points.

Alexandra Fonseca Montenegro, Sevim Genlik Polat, Md Mohsinur Rahman Adnan, Maryam Ghazisaeidi, Roberto C. Myers
Dislocation motion -- the atomic-scale mechanism of crystal plasticity -- governs the strength and ductility of materials. In functional materials, external stimuli beyond mechanical stress can also affect dislocation glide. In the wide band gap semiconductor ZnS, optical illumination suppresses plasticity, whereas electric fields can enhance dislocation motion. Here, we show that the common underlying mechanism for these phenomena is the charged dislocations that respond to the changes in carrier concentration. Our prior theoretical work showed that locally charged dislocations in ZnS trap excess carriers, triggering core reconstructions that modify their mobility, with the positively charged Zn-rich core dislocations showing the most drastic change. Here, we validate this prediction experimentally by showing that either optical excitation or electronic doping selectively inhibits the glide of Zn-rich dislocations in epitaxially grown ZnS. First, imaging individual interface misfit dislocations under different optical excitation conditions shows that Zn-core glide is strongly reduced as optical power is increased, while the S-core dislocations show negligible sensitivity to light, marking the first, single dislocation imaging of the photoplastic effect. Next, we show that a similar behavior is observed with direct electron (n-type) doping of ZnS epitaxial layers grown beyond the critical thickness. As the n-type dopant density is increased, the resulting Zn-core dislocation density is reduced by more than one order of magnitude, while the S-core density remains essentially unchanged, causing a sign reversal of the strain-anisotropy with n-type doping. These results demonstrate a common origin for the opto-electronic sensitivity of dislocations in ZnS and provide a pathway for the engineering of dislocation content in compound semiconductors.

Ipsita Mandal
We set out to compute the longitudinal magnetoconductivity for an isolated and isotropic Kramers-Weyl node (KWN), existing in chiral crystals, which forms an exotic cousin of the conventional Weyl nodes resulting from band-inversions. The peculiarities of KWNs are many, the principal one being the presence of two concentric Fermi surfaces at any positive chemical potential ($\mu$) with respect to the nodal point. This is caused by a dominant quadratic-in-momentum dispersion, with the linear-in-momentum Dirac- or Weyl-like terms relegated to a secondary status. In a KWN, the chirally-conjugate node typically serves as a mere doppelg\"anger, being significantly separated in energy. Hence, when $\mu$ is set near such a node, the signatures of a lone node are probed in the transport-measurements. The intrinsic topological quantities in the forms of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment contribute to the linear response, which we determine by exactly solving the semiclassical Bolzmann equations. Another crucial feature is that the two bands at the same KWN node carry actual spin-quantum numbers, thus providing an additional coupling to an external magnetic field ($\boldsymbol B$), and affecting the conductivity. We take this into account as well, and demonstrate that it causes a linear-in-$B$ dependence, on top of the usual $B^2$-dependence.

[94]. [*First-principles characterization of native defects and oxygen impurities in GaAs*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07954 "First-principles characterization of native defects and oxygen impurities in GaAs")
Khang Hoang
We present an investigation of native point defects and oxygen impurities in gallium arsenide (GaAs) using hybrid density-functional calculations. Defects are characterized by their structural, electronic, and optical properties. Dominant native defects are Ga antisites (Ga$_{\rm As}$), As antisites (As$_{\rm Ga}$), and/or Ga vacancies ($V_{\rm Ga}$) in which As$_{\rm Ga}$ and $V_{\rm Ga}$ are charge-compensating defects under As-rich conditions. On the basis of the calculated defect transition levels, the isolated As$_{\rm Ga}$ may be identified with the EL2 center reported in experiments. The defect, however, has a negligible nonradiative electron capture cross section and thus cannot be the "main electron trap" as commonly believed. We find that GaAs can have multiple O-related defect centers when prepared under As-rich conditions. The quasi-substitutional O impurity (O$_{\rm As}$) and its complex with two As$_{\rm Ga}$ defects (O$_{\rm As}$-2As$_{\rm Ga}$) have a metastable and paramagnetic middle (neutral) charge state. These two defects have large nonradiative electron capture cross sections and can be effective recombination centers.

Seyed Mahdi Mastoor, Amirhossein Ahmadkhan Kordbacheh
We introduce scalable machine learning models to accurately predict two key quantum transport properties, the transmission coefficient T(E) and the local density of states (LDOS) in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials with magnetic disorder. Using a tight binding Hamiltonian combined with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, we generate a large dataset of over 400,000 unique configurations across graphene, germanene, silicene, and stanene nanoribbons with varying geometries, impurity concentrations, and energy levels. A central contribution of this work is the development of a geometrydriven, physically interpretable feature space that enables the models to generalize across material types and device sizes. Random Forest regression and classification models are evaluated in terms of accuracy, stability, and extrapolation ability. Regression consistently outperforms classification in capturing continuous transport behavior on in-domain data. However, extrapolation performance degrades significantly, revealing the limitations of tree-based models in unseen regimes. This study highlights both the potential and constraints of scalable ML models for quantum transport prediction and motivates future research into physics-informed or graph-based learning architectures for improved generalization in spintronic and nanoelectronic device design.

Bander Linjawi
Homogeneous electron and nuclear gases are transformed to a localized trial density in absolute coordinates of the multi-component hamiltonian to determine the stability of forming bound states. Regions of stability were found both at the high density and low density regimes, where electron-nuclear correlations could play a critical role in the intermediate density regime. The use of Galilean coordinates is motivated for its use in density functional theory to develop kinetic and potential density functionals, from which suitable coordinate transformations to capture electron-nuclear correlations are applied.

Fabian Pichler, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap, Ashvin Vishwanath
Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.

Takanari Yasuia, Kazuya Nakayama
The optical responses for UV to NIR and muti-directional photo current have been found on Au (metal) on n-Si device. The unique phenomena have been unresolved since the first sample fabricated in 2007. The self organized sub-micron metal with various crystal faces was supposed to activate as an optical wave guide into Si surface. This, however, is insufficient to explain the unique features above. Thus, for more deep analysis, returning to consider the Si-band structure, indirect/direct transitions of inter conduction bands: X-W, X-K and {\Gamma}-L in the 1st Brillouin Zone/Van Hove singularity at L point, synchronizing with scattering, successfully give these characteristics a reasonable explanation. The calculation of the quantum efficiency between X-W and X-K agreed with those sensitivity for visible region (1.1 to 2.0 eV), the doping process well simulates it for NIR (0.6 to 1.0 eV). Doping electrons (~10^18/cm3) are filled up the zero-gap at around X of a reciprocal lattice point. This is why a lower limit of 0.6 eV was arisen in the sensitivity measurement. When the carrier scattering model was applied to the inter band (X-W, X-K and {\Gamma}-L) transitions, the reasonable interpretation was obtained for the directional dependence of photo-currents with UV (3.4 eV) and Visible (3.1 and 1.9 eV) excitation. Band to band scatterings assist to extend the available optical range and increase variety of directional responses. Utilizing this principle for some indirect transition semiconductors, it will be able to open the new frontier in photo-conversion system, where it will be released from those band gaps and directivity limitations.

Antiferromagnets have been shown to harbor strong magnon squeezing in equilibrium, making them a potential resource for quantum correlations and entanglement. Recent experiments have also found them to host coherently coupled magnonic excitations forming a magnon pseudospin, in analogy to electronic spin. Here, we delineate the quantum properties of antiferromagnetic magnon pseudospin by accounting for spin non-conserving interactions and going beyond the rotating wave approximation. Employing concrete examples of nickel oxide and hematite, we find strong squeezing of the magnon pseudospin highlighting its important role in determining the eigenmode quantum properties. Via ground state quantum fluctuations engineering, this pseudospin squeezing enables an enhancement and control of coupling between the magnonic modes and other excitations. Finally, we evaluate the quantum superpositions that comprise a squeezed pseudospin ground state and delineate a qubit spectroscopy protocol to detect them. Our results are applicable to any system of coupled bosons and thus introduce quantum fluctuations engineering of a general bosonic pseudospin.

Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science, accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows, while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o. Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.

Utilizing locally available materials is a crucial step towards sustainable planetary habitation. Lunar regolith has gained tremendous interest in additive manufacturing in the past decades. However, due to the constrained manufacturing facilities and materials on the moon, many existing additive manufacturing methods are not suitable for practical on-site manufacturing. Here, we envision that light-based direct sintering of lunar regolith can be a feasible approach. Instead of directly manufacturing large structures, we hypothesize that small-scale, reconfigurable building blocks can be an alternative to form large and complex structures. To verify the feasibility, we conducted laser sintering of lunar regolith simulants as a proof of concept, following a simple theoretical calculation for direct sintering using the light available in space. Different laser processing parameters are investigated to obtain controllable lunar regolith sintering. We further designed Lego-like interlocking bricks that are reconfigurable for different structure assemblies without additional material. Mechanical performance (compressive strength) of sintered cubic blocks is evaluated, showing a peak stress of ~1.5 MPa. We hope this work will inspire other in-space manufacturing techniques and enable low-cost space habitation.

Simon Laflamme, Bugrahan Guner, Omur E. Dagdeviren
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) enables high-resolution imaging and quantitative force measurement, which is critical for understanding nanoscale mechanical, chemical, and biological interactions. In dynamic AFM modes, however, interaction forces are not directly measured; they must be mathematically reconstructed from observables such as amplitude, phase, or frequency shift. Many reconstruction techniques have been proposed over the last two decades, but they rely on different assumptions and have been applied inconsistently, limiting reproducibility and cross-study comparison. Here, we systematically evaluate major force reconstruction methods in both frequency- and amplitude-modulation AFM, detailing their theoretical foundations, performance regimes, and sources of error. To support benchmarking and reproducibility, we introduce an open-source software package that unifies all widely used methods, enabling side-by-side comparisons across different formulations. This work represents a critical step toward achieving consistent and interpretable AFM force spectroscopy, thereby supporting the more reliable application of AFM in fields ranging from materials science to biophysics.

Samuel Feldman, Hassam Ghazali, Andrey Rogachev
We construct a completely analog framework that emulates universal quantum gates and quantum algorithms. It is based on electronic circuits made of operational amplifiers, resistors and capacitors. In these circuits, input and output lines represent the computational basis states (CBSs) and thus $2^n$ lines are required to represent $n$ qubits. An operation of the circuits is based on classical evolution and interference of complex amplitudes associated with each CBS. The framework can emulate entangled states and is free from decoherence, measurements are classical and do not collapse states. Similar to physical quantum computers, emulated quantum algorithms can be constructed as a sequence of the gates belonging to a universal set (phase shift, Hadamard, controlled-NOT), as a unitary matrix and as combinations of the two. Circuits representing the universal gates have been made and tested. We also have made a matrix-based emulator of a 3-qubit Grover search algorithm. We tested it by searching for one and two particular states with one and two iterations and found that its outputs accurately match predicted values. We anticipate that the emulators can work as sub-components of physical quantum computers. On their own, the emulators can be used for operations that require a few qubits or operations that can be split into independent (and perhaps weakly entangled) blocks of qubits.

Understanding the high-pressure phase behavior of carbon dioxide-hydrocarbon mixtures is of considerable interest owing to their wide range of applications. Under certain conditions, these systems are not amenable to direct visual monitoring, and experimentalists often rely on spectrophotometric data to infer phase behavior. Consequently, developing computationally efficient and robust methods to leverage such data is crucial. Here, we combine nearest neighbor permutation entropy, computed directly from in situ near-infrared absorbance spectra acquired during depressurization trials of mixtures of carbon dioxide and a distilled petroleum fraction, with an anomaly detection approach to identify phase transitions. We show that changes in nearest neighbor entropy effectively signal transitions from initially homogeneous mixtures to two-phase equilibria, thereby enabling accurate out-of-sample online predictions of transition pressures. Our approach requires minimum data preprocessing, no specialized detection techniques or visual inspection of the spectra, and is sufficiently general to be adapted for studying phase behavior in other high-pressure systems monitored via spectrophotometry.

Tadashi Takayanagi
Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.

Nilamoni Daloi, Rahul Gupta, Aritra Ghosh, Pardeep Kumar, Himadri Shekhar Dhar, M. Bhattacharya
We theoretically propose a photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) quantum memory platform based on an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a ring trap and placed inside a Fabry-Perot cavity driven by Laguerre-Gaussian beams. In contrast to electromagnetically induced transparency-based protocols, our memory does not require change of internal atomic levels. The optical states are instead stored in the large Hilbert space of topologically protected and long-lived motional states (persistent currents) of the condensate, yielding a storage time three orders of magnitude better than presently available. Further, the use of a cavity provides orders of magnitude more resonances, and hence bandwidth, for reading and writing than internal atomic transitions. Finally, the analogy to cavity optomechanics suggests a natural path to wavelength conversion, OAM transduction, and nondestructive readout of the memory.

Shicheng Yu, Xiaojie Zhang, Xia Lei, Liang Zhai
Quantum emitters serve as essential on-demand photonic resources, generating quantum states of light such as single photons and entangled photon pairs while serving as interfaces between light and matter. Buried in the solid state, quantum emitters enable a straightforward adoption of advanced nanofabrication techniques, facilitating precise engineering of their photonic environment for scalable quantum technologies. In this review, we introduce the fundamentals of quantum emitters and the key metrics characterising their performance. We highlight three material platforms: quantum dots, defect centres in diamond, and defect centres in silicon carbide. We summarise the recent developments of these platforms and discuss their advancements in quantum applications, including quantum communication, computation, and sensing. Finally, we provide a comparison across the three platforms, along with an outlook on future directions and potential challenges.

Pattern formation driven by mechanical stress plays a fundamental role in shaping structural organization in both natural and human-made systems. However, achieving localized and programmable control of individual microstructures remains a challenge. Here, we present a vectorial field-guided lithography as a novel and versatile method for the photo-reconfiguration of photosensitive azopolymer microstructures. Building on the Viscoplastic PhotoAlignment model, recently proposed to describe the stress-driven response of azomaterials, we reveal structured polarization fields that are directly mapped into programmable surface architectures through stress-driven deformation. Using a digital polarization rotator implemented via a spatial light modulator, we prove the single-step fabrication of anisotropic, bent, and chiral microstructures from a single pre-patterned geometry, highlighting the power of polarization vector fields as active design parameters. Experimentally, we validate the theoretical model and demonstrate its predictive strength even under fully structured light, establishing for the first time a comprehensive theoretical framework capable of quantitively designing target morphologies. Our work demonstrates that the full vectorial nature of light, and not just its intensity, can dictate the mechanical reshaping of functional polymer surfaces, providing a new platform for the programmable design of complex micro-architectures with applications in photonics, microfluidics, and biology.

Surajit Saha
Urn models have long been used to study stochastic processes, probability distributions, and reinforcement dynamics. Meanwhile, discrete time quantum walks (DTQW) serve as fundamental components in quantum computation and quantum information theory. This work explores a novel connection between an urn model and discrete-time quantum walks, focusing on how urn-based stochastic processes can provide insights into quantum state evolution and algorithmic behavior. Importantly, our model operates entirely with real-valued quantities, without relying on complex amplitudes of the quantum walk. Every stochastic rule is derived from urn-based processes, whose parameters are governed by the coin and shift mechanisms of the quantum walk, maintaining the structural dynamics of the DTQW. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to bridge classical and quantum frameworks, offering new perspectives on both quantum algorithms and stochastic modeling. This work connects the urn model to the broad range of applications where DTQWs are successfully employed.

Mahault Albarracin, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel
In this paper we will articulate a view of resilience under the free energy principle and vice versa. The free energy principle is about existence and identity, and resilience is the condition under which things exist at all. In previous work this has been investigated as modelling resilience using the free energy principle. We will extend that work by making the case that self-organisation under the free energy principle is about resilience, in the sense that identity is a constant process of self-reconfiguration, implying the existence of a self-model and the energy to reconfigure that self-model -- and hence, the resilience of a maintained identity under changes. A general framework for thinking about resilience in this context will be sketched out and some models will be provided using that framework.

Darui Lu, Jordan M. Malof, Willie J. Padilla
Recent significant advances in integrating multiple Large Language Model (LLM) systems have enabled Agentic Frameworks capable of performing complex tasks autonomously, including novel scientific research. We develop and demonstrate such a framework specifically for the inverse design of photonic metamaterials. When queried with a desired optical spectrum, the Agent autonomously proposes and develops a forward deep learning model, accesses external tools via APIs for tasks like simulation and optimization, utilizes memory, and generates a final design via a deep inverse method. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated in its ability to automate, reason, plan, and adapt. Notably, the Agentic Framework possesses internal reflection and decision flexibility, permitting highly varied and potentially novel outputs.

Sajedeh Sarmastani, Maliheh Ghodrat, Yousef Jamali
We present a neuronal network model inspired by the Ising model, where each neuron is a binary spin ($s_i = \pm1$) interacting with its neighbors on a 2D lattice. Updates are asynchronous and follow Metropolis dynamics, with a temperature-like parameter $T$ introducing stochasticity.
  To incorporate physiological realism, each neuron includes fixed on/off durations, mimicking the refractory period found in real neurons. These counters prevent immediate reactivation, adding biologically grounded timing constraints to the model.
  As $T$ varies, the network transitions from asynchronous to synchronised activity. Near a critical point $T_c$, we observe hallmarks of criticality: heightened fluctuations, long-range correlations, and increased sensitivity. These features resemble patterns found in cortical recordings, supporting the hypothesis that the brain operates near criticality for optimal information processing.
  This simplified model demonstrates how basic spin interactions and physiological constraints can yield complex, emergent behavior, offering a useful tool for studying criticality in neural systems through statistical physics.

Arev Hambardzumyan, Rafayel Ghasabyan, Vahagn Tamazyan
In the realm of contemporary materials testing, the demand for scalability, adaptability, parallelism, and speed has surged due to the proliferation of diverse materials and testing standards. Traditional controller-based systems often fall short in meeting these requirements, resulting in adaptability and processing speed limitations. Conversely, FPGA-based controllers present a multifaceted, high-performance solution. Key advantages of FPGA-based controllers in materials testing encompass reconfiguration capabilities for cost-effective adaptation to evolving materials and standards. FPGAs also enable the integration of parallel control and data acquisition circuits, vital for multichannel test equipment demanding simultaneous, independent operation of multiple control channels.

Arg\"uello-Luengo Javier
Interactions between quantum particles, such as electrons, are the source of important effects, ranging from superconductivity, to the formation of molecular bonds, or the stability of elementary compounds at high-energies. In this article, we illustrate how advances in the cold-atom community to further engineer such long-range interactions have stimulated the simulation of new regimes of these fundamental many-body problems. The goal is two-fold: first, to provide a comprehensive review of the different strategies proposed and/or experimentally realized to induce long-range interactions among atoms moving in optical potentials. Second, to showcase various fields where such platforms can offer new insights, ranging from the simulation of condensed matter phenomena to the study of lattice gauge theories, and the simulation of electronic configurations in chemistry. We then discuss the challenges and opportunities of these platforms compared to other complementary approaches based on digital simulation and quantum computation.

E. C. I. Paterson, M. E. Tobar, M. Goryachev, J. Bourhill
We report the experimental observation of two distinct Berry phases ($+\frac{2\pi}{3}$ and $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$) generated on the surface of a M\"{o}bius cavity resonator at microwave frequencies supporting the TE$_{1,0,n}$ mode family. This resonator consists of a twisted, mirror-asymmetric prism with a cross-section of the triangular $D_3$ symmetry group, bent around on itself to form a ring. This geometric class supports resonant modes with non-zero electromagnetic helicity (i.e. nonzero $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$ product) at microwave frequencies. There exist modes with three-fold rotational symmetry as well as those that exhibit no rotational symmetry. The latter result in an accumulated Berry phase whilst the former do not, which is determined from the measured frequency shift of the modes when compared to a mirror-symmetric resonator of otherwise equivalent geometry.

[*Electrical Conductivity of Superionic Hydrous SiO2 and the Origin of Lower-mantle High Conductivity Anomalies Beneath Subduction Zones*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07352 "Electrical Conductivity of Superionic Hydrous SiO2 and the Origin of Lower-mantle High Conductivity Anomalies Beneath Subduction Zones")
Mako Inada, Yoshiyuki Okuda, Kenta Oka, Hideharu Kuwahara, Steeve Gr\'eaux, Kei Hirose
Electrical conductivity (EC) is one of the important physical properties of minerals and rocks that can be used to characterize the composition and structure of the deep interior of the Earth.Theoretical studies have predicted that the CaCl2-type hydrous Al-bearing SiO2 phase, present in subducted crustal materials, becomes superionic-meaning that protons are no longer bonded to a specific oxygen atom but instead become mobile within the SiO2 lattice-under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions corresponding to the lower mantle. The enhancement of the EC upon such superionic transition has not been experimentally verified yet. Here, we measured the EC of Al-bearing SiO2 containing 1750 ppm H2O at pressures up to 82 GPa and temperatures up to 2610 K by employing a recently developed technique designed for measuring transparent materials. Results demonstrate a sudden increase in EC to approximately 10 S/m at temperatures of 1100-2200 K, depending on pressure, which is several to ten times higher than that of the surrounding shallow to middle part of the lower mantle, which is attributed to a transition to the superionic state. If hydrous SiO2 is substantially weaker than other coexisting phases and thus forms an interconnected film in subducted MORB crust, the EC of the bulk MORB materials is significantly enhanced by superionic SiO2 in the lower mantle up to ~1800 km depth, which may explain the high EC anomalies observed at subduction zones underneath northeastern China. The observed EC anomalies can be matched by the EC of subducted MORB materials containing Al-bearing SiO2 with a water content of approximately 0.2 wt%, providing insights into the deep H2O circulation and distribution in the Earth's mantle.

Wei Liu, Rui-Hao Bi, Wenjie Dou
Variational optimization of neural-network quantum state representations has achieved FCI-level accuracy for ground state calculations, yet computing optical properties involving excited states remains challenging. In this work, we present a neural-network-based variational quantum Monte Carlo approach for ab-initio absorption spectra. We leverage parallel batch autoregressive sampling and GPU-supported local energy parallelism to efficiently compute ground states of complex systems. By integrating neural quantum ground states with the kernel polynomial method, our approach accurately calculates absorption spectra for large molecules with over 50 electrons, achieving FCI-level precision. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior scalability and reduced runtime compared to FCI, marking a significant step forward in optical property calculations for large-scale quantum systems.

Moein N. Ivaki, Austin J. Szuminsky, Achilleas Lazarides, Alexandre Zagoskin, Gerard McCaul, Tapio Ala-Nissila
Non-Hermitian (NH) systems provide a fertile platform for quantum technologies, owing in part to their distinct dynamical phases. These systems can be characterized by the preservation or spontaneous breaking of parity-time reversal symmetry, significantly impacting the dynamical behavior of quantum resources such as entanglement and purity; resources which in turn govern the system's information processing and memory capacity. Here we investigate this relationship using the example of an interacting NH spin system defined on random graphs. We show that the onset of the first exceptional point - marking the real-to-complex spectral transition - also corresponds to an abrupt change in the system's learning capacity. We further demonstrate that this transition is controllable via local disorder and spin interactions strength, thereby defining a tunable learnability threshold. Within the learning phase, the system exhibits the key features required for memory-dependent reservoir computing. This makes explicit a direct link between spectral structure and computational capacity, further establishing non-Hermiticity, and more broadly engineered dissipation, as a dynamic resource for temporal quantum machine learning.

Ivan Soriano-Diaz, Ilya D. Dergachev, Sergey A. Varganov, Enrique Orti, Angelo Giussani
A pillar of our current understanding of the photoluminescence of Ir(III) complexes is the assumption that the population of triplet metal-centered states determines an efficient non-radiative decay to the ground state minimum. Based on that assumption, the energy separation between the emitting state and the minimum-energy crossing point of the triplet metal-centered and the ground states has been employed as a key variable for evaluating the ability of Ir(III) complexes to decay non-radiatively. We demonstrate that the strong spin-orbit coupling between the triplet metal-centered and the ground state of Ir(III) complexes, together with the sloped topography of their crossing, lead to a significant energy separation between the two states, resulting in a reduced rate of non-radiative ground state recovery. Therefore, we propose that the role of metal-centered states is defined by the tendency of the excited state population to remain trapped in the metal-centered minima.

Erik Orvehed Hiltunen, John C. Schotland
We introduce and study a generalized energy conservation relation for scattering of time-modulated waves, where conventional energy conservation does not hold. Based on this relation, we derive an optical theorem and compute the active power describing the power input or output due to scattering. Notably, the same system may be subject to energy gain, energy loss, or energy conservation depending on the frequency harmonics present in the wave field. Moreover, we show how the optical theorem derived herein may be used for image reconstruction based on measurements of the power. Notably, such measurements do not require information about the phase of the scattered field.

[121]. [*Electrodynamics of correlated electron systems*](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1126 "Electrodynamics of correlated electron systems")
N. P. Armitage
Physical and chemical systems can be characterized by their natural frequency and energy scales. It is hardly an exaggeration that most of what we know about such systems, from the acoustics of a violin to the energy levels of atoms, comes from their response to perturbations at these natural frequencies. It is of course the same situation in `correlated' electron materials. We can learn about the novel effects of strong electron-electron interactions and the properties of collective states of matter (superconductors, quantum magnets etc.) by characterizing their response to small amplitude perturbations at their natural frequencies. In solids, these natural frequency scales span an impressively large frequency range from x-ray down to DC. This incredibly broad range means that a blizzard of experimental techniques and analysis methods are required for the characterization of correlated systems with optical techniques. This short review and lecture notes attempt to lay out a brief summary of the formalism, techniques, and analysis used for `optical' spectroscopies of correlated electron systems. They are idiosyncratic, occasionally opinionated, and - considering the breadth of the subject - incredibly brief.

A central problem in modern condensed matter physics is the understanding of materials with strong electron correlations. Despite extensive work, the essential physics of many of these systems is not understood and there is very little ability to make predictions in this class of materials. In this manuscript we share our personal views on the major open problems in the field of correlated electron systems. We discuss some possible routes to make progress in this rich and fascinating field. This manuscript is the result of the vigorous discussions and deliberations that took place at Johns Hopkins University during a three-day workshop January 27, 28, and 29, 2020 that brought together six senior scientists and 46 more junior scientists. Our hope, is that the topics we have presented will provide inspiration for others working in this field and motivation for the idea that significant progress can be made on very hard problems if we focus our collective energies.

Sk Anisur, W. Vincent Liu, Sayan Choudhury
A discrete time crystal (DTC) is a remarkable non-equilibrium phase of matter characterized by the persistent sub-harmonic oscillations of physical observables in periodically driven many-body systems. Motivated by the question of whether such a temporal periodic order can persist when the drive becomes aperiodic, we investigate the dynamics of a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model under quasiperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driving. Intriguingly, this infinite-range-interacting spin system can host ``quasi-discrete time crystal" (quasi-DTC) phases characterized by periodic oscillations of the magnetization. We demonstrate that our model can host the quasi-DTC analog of both period-doubling DTCs as well as higher-order DTCs. These quasi-DTCs are robust to various perturbations, and they originate from the interplay of ``all-to-all" interactions and the recursive structure of the TM sequence. Our results suggest that quasi-periodic driving protocols can provide a promising route for realizing novel non-equilibrium phases of matter in long-range interacting systems.

Weicheng Fu, Sihan Feng, Yong Zhang, Hong Zhao
The symmetry of the interparticle interaction potential (IIP) plays a critical role in determining the thermodynamic and transport properties of solids. This study investigates the isolated effect of IIP asymmetry on thermalization. Asymmetry and nonlinearity are typically intertwined. To isolate the effect of asymmetry, we introduce a one-dimensional asymmetric harmonic (AH) model whose IIP possesses asymmetry but no nonlinearity, evidenced by energy-independent vibrational frequencies. Extensive numerical simulations confirm a power-law relationship between thermalization time ($T_{\rm eq}$) and perturbation strength for the AH chain, revealing an exponent larger than the previously observed inverse-square law in the thermodynamic limit. Upon adding symmetric quartic nonlinearity into the AH model, we systematically study thermalization under combined asymmetry and nonlinearity. Matthiessen's rule provides a good estimate of $T_{\rm eq}$ in this case. Our results demonstrate that asymmetry plays a distinct role in enhancing higher-order effects and governing relaxation dynamics.

Francesco Macheda, Paolo Barone, Francesco Mauri
We study the effect of doping on the electron-phonon interaction and on the phonon frequencies in doped semiconductors, taking into account the screening in presence of free carriers at finite temperature. We study the impact of screening on the Fr\"ohlich-like vertex and on the long-range components of the dynamical matrix, going beyond the state-of-the-art description for undoped crystals, thanks to the development of a computational method based on maximally localized Wannier functions. We apply our approach to cubic silicon carbide, where in presence of doping the Fr\"ohlich coupling and the longitudinal-transverse phonon splitting are strongly reduced, thereby influencing observable properties such as the electronic lifetime.

R. Tuovinen, Y. Pavlyukh, E. Perfetto, G. Stefanucci
We present a time-linear scaling method to simulate open and correlated quantum systems out of equilibrium. The method inherits from many-body perturbation theory the possibility to choose selectively the most relevant scattering processes in the dynamics, thereby paving the way to the real-time characterization of correlated ultrafast phenomena in quantum transport. The open system dynamics is described in terms of an embedding correlator from which the time-dependent current can be calculated using the Meir-Wingreen formula. We show how to efficiently implement our approach through a simple grafting into recently proposed time-linear Green's function methods for closed systems. Electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions can be treated on equal footing while preserving all fundametal conservation laws.

We report on resonance Raman spectroscopy measurements with excitation photon energy down to 1.16 eV on graphene, to study how low-energy carriers interact with lattice vibrations. Thanks to the excitation energy close to the Dirac point at $\mathbf{K}$, we unveil a giant increase of the intensity ratio between the double-resonant 2D and 2D$^\prime$ peaks with respect to that measured in graphite. Comparing with fully \textit{ab initio} theoretical calculations, we conclude that the observation is explained by an enhanced, momentum-dependent coupling between electrons and Brillouin zone-boundary optical phonons. This finding applies to two dimensional Dirac systems and has important consequences for the modeling of transport in graphene devices operating at room temperature.

Francesco Macheda, Thibault Sohier, Paolo Barone, Francesco Mauri
Electron-phonon interaction and phonon frequencies of doped polar semiconductors are sensitive to long-range Coulomb forces and can be strongly affected by screening effects of free carriers, the latter changing significantly when approaching the two-dimensional limit. We tackle this problem within a linear-response dielectric-matrix formalism, where screening effects can be properly taken into account by generalized effective charge functions and the inverse scalar dielectric function, allowing for controlled approximations in relevant limits. We propose complementary computational methods to evaluate from first principles both effective charges -- encompassing all multipolar components beyond dynamical dipoles and quadrupoles -- and the static dielectric function of doped two-dimensional semiconductors, and provide analytical expressions for the long-range part of the dynamical matrix and the electron-phonon interaction in the long-wavelength limit. As a representative example, we apply our approach to study the impact of doping in disproportionated graphene, showing that optical Fr\"ohlich and acoustic piezoelectric couplings, as well as the slope of optical longitudinal modes, are strongly reduced, with a potential impact on the electronic/intrinsic scattering rates and related transport properties.

In this work we perform electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) of freestanding graphene with high energy and momentum resolution to disentangle the quasielastic scattering from the excitation gap of Dirac electrons close to the optical limit. We show the importance of many-body effects on electronic excitations at finite transferred momentum by comparing measured EELS with ab initio calculations at increasing levels of theory. Quasi-particle corrections and excitonic effects are addressed within the GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation, respectively. Both effects are essential in the description of the EEL spectra to obtain a quantitative agreement with experiments, with the position, dispersion, and shape of both the excitation gap and the $\pi$ plasmon being significantly affected by excitonic effects.

Kazuhiko Tsutsumi, Yoshimichi Teratani, Kaiji Motoyama, Rui Sakano, Akira Oguri
We study how bias and tunneling asymmetries affect nonlinear current through a quantum dot with $N$ discrete levels in the Fermi liquid regime, using an exact low-energy expansion of the current derived up to terms of order $V^3$ with respect to the bias voltage. The expansion coefficients are described in terms of the phase shift, the linear susceptibilities, and the three-body correlation functions, defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state of the Anderson impurity model. In particular, the three-body correlations play an essential role in the order $V^3$ term, and their coupling to the nonlinear current depends crucially on the bias and tunnel asymmetries. The number of independent components of the three-body correlation functions increases with $N$ the internal degrees of the quantum dots, and it gives a variety in the low-energy transport. We calculate the correlation functions over a wide range of electron fillings of the Anderson impurity model with the SU($N$) internal symmetry, using the numerical renormalization group. We find that the order $V^3$ nonlinear current through the SU($N$) Kondo state, which occurs at electron fillings of $1$ and $N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions, significantly varies with the three-body contributions as tunnel asymmetries increase. Furthermore, in the valence fluctuation regime toward the empty or fully occupied impurity state, a sharp peak emerges in the coefficient of $V^3$ current in the case at which bias and tunneling asymmetries cooperatively enhance the charge transfer from one of the electrodes.

V. I. Tokar
The probability distribution (PD) of spin configurations in kinetic Ising models has been cast in the form of the canonical Boltzmann PD with a time-dependent effective Hamiltonian (EH). It has been argued that in systems with extensive energy EH depends linearly on the number of spins $N$ leading to the exponential dependence of PD on the system size. In macroscopic systems the argument of the exponential function may reach values of the order of the Avogadro number which is impossible to deal with computationally, thus making unusable the linear master equation (ME) governing the PD evolution. To overcome the difficulty, it has been suggested to use instead the nonlinear ME (NLME) for the EH density per spin. It has been shown that in spatially homogeneous systems NLME contains only terms of order unity even in the thermodynamic limit. The approach has been illustrated with the kinetic Husimi-Temperley model (HTM) evolving under the Glauber dynamics. At finite $ N $ the known numerical results has been reproduced and extended to broader parameter ranges. In the thermodynamic limit an exact nonlinear partial differential equation of the Hamilton-Jacobi type for EH has been derived. It has been shown that the average magnetization in HTM evolves according to the conventional kinetic mean field equation.

Anzhuoer Li, Liang Dong, Qian Niu
We present a theory of geodynamics in a space-time crystal based on an event wave packet constructed from the Floquet-Bloch waves, which not only involve a scalar dispersion function but also a Berry curvature tensor in the phase space manifold of space-time and the reciprocal quasi energy-momentum. In the presence of structural deformation, this theory is naturally extended into a covariant form with the introduction of a lattice connection constructed out of the gradients of the local lattice vectors. The geodesic equation for a particle not only involves the lattice connection but also higher-order corrections from space-time inhomogeneity of Berry curvatures and quasi energy-momentum dispersion gradients. These emergent connections and metric terms in the geodesic equations indicate the potential to experimentally realize artificial gravitational effects, thereby establishing a direct conceptual link between general relativity and quantum theory.

Aseem Rajan Kshirsagar, Sven Reichardt
BiFeO$_3$ is a multiferroic material featuring ferroelectricity and noncollinear antiferromagnetism. Definitive and efficient control of the characteristic spin texture of BiFeO$_3$ is attractive for emerging quantum devices. In this regard, crystal-field $d\rightarrow d$ excitations localized on Fe atomic sites in BiFeO$_3$ provide an avenue for manipulation of the spin texture as they induce a complex interplay among the spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom. In this work, the \textit{ab initio} \textit{GW}-BSE method is used to characterize these excitations within an excitonic picture. We find that the $d-d$ transitions appear as strongly bound, chiral, spin-flip excitons deep within the electronic band gap as a result of the intricate competition between the lattice potential, the antiferromagnetic ordering, the spin-orbit coupling, and the electron-hole interaction. Most crucially, these excitons are composed of electron-hole pairs with opposite spins that constitute almost all of their $\pm \hbar$ total angular momentum. These excitons of specific angular momentum can be selectively excited using circularly polarized light, consequently modulating the local magnetic moment.

Francesco Macheda, Francesco Mauri, Thibault Sohier
Plasmons and polar phonons are elementary electrodynamic excitations of matter. In 2d and at long wavelengths, they couple to light and act as the system polaritons. They also dictate the scattering of charged carriers. Van der Waals heterostructures offer the opportunity to couple excitations from different layers via long-range Coulomb interactions, modifying both their dispersion and their scattering of electrons. Even when the excitations do not couple, they are still influenced by the screening from all layers, leading to complex dynamical interactions between electrons, plasmons and polar phonons. We develop an efficient ab initio model to solve the dynamical electric response of Van der Waals heterostructures, accompanied by a formalism to extract relevant spectroscopic and transport quantities. Notably, we obtain scattering rates for electrons of the heterostructure coupling remotely with electrodynamic excitations. We apply those developments to BN-capped graphene, in which polar phonons from BN couple to plasmons in graphene. We study the nature of the coupled excitations, their dispersion and their coupling to graphene's electrons. Regimes driven by either phonons or plasmons are identified, as well as a truly hybrid regime at long wavelengths. Those are studied as a function of the graphene's Fermi level and the number of BN layers. In contrast with descriptions in terms of surface-optical phonons, we find that the electron-phonon interaction stems from different modes. Moreover, the dynamical screening of the coupling between BN's LO phonons and graphene's electrons crosses over from inefficient to metal-like depending on the relative value of the phonons' frequency and the energetic onset of interband transitions. While the coupling is significant in general, the associated scattering of graphene's carriers is found to be negligible in the context of electronic transport.

Paolo Fachin, Francesco Macheda, Paolo Barone, Francesco Mauri
We propose a new approach to study the transition between different topological states, based on the assessment of the vibrational resonances in infrared spectra. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele models finding that Born effective charges are nearly quantized, with a discontinuous jump concomitant with the topological phase transition. In particular, Born effective charges display a finite value in the trivial phase and a null one in the nontrivial one. This is rooted in the connection between Born effective charges and electronic Berry curvature at the band edges. Finally, at the topological phase transition of the Haldane model, we also observe a nearly quantized jump of the chiral splitting of the zone-center phonon frequencies, induced by time-reversal symmetry breaking.

Peng He, Jing-Xin Liu, Hong Wu, Z. D. Wang
The topological orders in amorphous systems that lack crystalline symmetry have gained considerable attention recently. Here we propose the Floquet amorphous topological matter, among which the topological orders are explored in experimentally accessible one-dimensional array of randomly pointed Rydberg atoms with periodic driving. The topological properties are comprehensively characterized, considering both the single-particle and many-body perspectives. It is found that the periodic driving leads to rich topological phases of matter. At the single-particle level, we evaluate the real space winding numbers and polarization, revealing robust amorphous topological phases with 0-type and $\pi$-type edge modes. We show a structural disorder induced topological phase transition associated with localization transition in the nonequilibrium system. Remarkably, in the many-body case it is discovered that the amorphous topological order exists in the chain of hardcore bosons, captured by the topological entanglement entropy and the string order. Moreover, feasible experimental probe protocols are also elaborated.

Haoyu Guo, Rohit Mukherjee, Debanjan Chowdhury
The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.

Fan Yang, Emil J. Bergholtz
The anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems featuring an intricate interplay between skin and boundary modes has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental attention. Still, in dimensions higher than one, this interplay remains much less understood. Here we provide insights from exact analytical solutions of a large class of models in any dimension, $d$, with open boundaries in $d_c \le d$ directions and by tracking their topological origin. Specifically, we show that amoeba theory accounting for the separation gaps of the bulk modes augmented with higher-dimensional generalizations of the biorthogonal polarization and the generalized Brillouin zone approaches accounting for the surface gaps of boundary modes provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems.

Avedis Neehus, Frank Pollmann, Johannes Knolle
We investigate a model of Dirac fermions with Haldane type mass impurities which open a global topological gap even in the dilute limit. Surprisingly, we find that the chirality of this mass term, i.e., the sign of the Chern number, can be reversed by tuning the magnitude of the single-impurity scattering. Consequently, the disorder induces a phase disconnected from the clean topological phase, i.e., a genuine topological Anderson insulator. In seeming contradiction to the expectation that mass disorder is an irrelevant perturbation to the clean integer quantum Hall transition, the tri-critical point separating these two Chern insulating phases and a thermal metal phase is located at zero impurity density and connected to the appearance of a zero energy bound state in the continuum corresponding to a divergent Haldane mass impurity. Our conclusions based on the T-matrix expansion are substantiated by large scale Chebyshev-Polynomial-Green-Function numerics. We discuss possible experimental platforms.

In transmission electron energy-loss spectroscopy, the cross section in 2D is quenched by kinematic effects once the momentum transfer becomes smaller than a critical value set by $q_z$, the momentum loss parallel to the beam. Our highly momentum ($\Delta q = 0.02$~\r{A}$^{-1}$) and energy ($\Delta E = 45$~meV) resolved setup is instrumental on delivering the unprecedented experimental verification of quenched 2D EEL spectra on freestanding graphene at momentum transfers $q$ below $0.06$\r{A}$^{-1}$. We retrieve the intrinsic uniform dielectric response of graphene from measured spectra by quantifying the kinematic suppression.

Francesco Macheda, Paolo Barone, Francesco Mauri
Within the context of first principles techniques we present a theoretical and computational framework to quickly determine, at finite momentum, the self-consistent (longitudinal) charge response to an external perturbation, that enters the determination of the scattering cross section of inelastic scattering processes such as EELS. We also determine the (tranverse) charge response computed in short-circuit condition. The all-order quasimomentum expansion of the tranverse charge response to an atomic displacement are the Born effective charges, quadrupoles, octupoles etc. We demonstrate that the transverse charge response can be related to the longitudinal one via a well-defined long-range dielectric function. Our advancements lead to an efficient use of perturbation theory. Due to its more favorable scaling, our method provides an interesting computational alternative to the use of the 2n+1 theorem, especially for semiconductors and metals with large unit cells. For semiconductors, we compute the piezoelectric properties of a large cell solid-solution of semiconducting hafniun oxide containing 96 atoms. We here show that the clamped ion piezoelectric response can be decomposed into real-space localized contributions that mostly depend on the chemical environment, paving the way for the use of machine-learning techniques in the material search for optimized piezoelectrics. We further apply our methodology to determine the density response of metals. Here, the leading terms of the charge expansion are related to the Fermi energy shift of the potential and by Born effective charges which do not sum to zero over the atoms. We apply our developments to the TEM-EELS spectroscopy of lithium intercalated graphites, where we find that the use of the atomic form-factor in the long-wavelength limit does not take into account for the anisotropy of the atomic chemical bonding.

Cells undergo dramatic morphological changes during embryogenesis, yet how these changes affect the formation of ordered tissues remains elusive. Here, we show that a phase transition leading to the formation of a nematic liquid crystal state during gastrulation in the development of embryos of fish, frogs, and fruit flies occurs by a common mechanism despite substantial differences between these evolutionarily distant animals. Importantly, nematic order forms early before any discernible changes in the shapes of cells. All three species exhibit similar propagation of the nematic phase, reminiscent of nucleation and growth mechanisms. The spatial correlations in the nematic phase in the notochord region are long-ranged and follow a similar power-law decay (y~$x^{-\alpha}$ ) with $\alpha$ less than unity, indicating a common underlying physical mechanism. To explain the common physical mechanism, we created a theoretical model that not only explains the experimental observations but also predicts that the nematic phase should be disrupted upon loss of planar cell polarity (frog), cell adhesion (frog), and notochord boundary formation (zebrafish). Gene knockdown or mutational studies confirm the theoretical predictions. The combination of experiments and theory provides a unified framework for understanding the potentially universal features of metazoan embryogenesis, in the process shedding light on the advent of ordered structures during animal development.

R. V. Cherbunin, A. Liubomirov, D. Novokreschenov, A. Kudlis, A. V. Kavokin
We experimentally observe harmonic oscillations in a bosonic condensate of exciton-polaritons confined within an elliptical trap. These oscillations arise from quantum beats between two size-quantized states of the condensate, split in energy due to the trap's ellipticity. By precisely targeting specific spots inside the trap with nonresonant laser pulses, we control frequency, amplitude, and phase of these quantum beats. The condensate wave function dynamics is visualized on a streak camera and mapped to the Bloch sphere, demonstrating Hadamard and Pauli-Z operations. We conclude that a qubit based on a superposition of these two polariton states would exhibit a coherence time exceeding the lifetime of an individual exciton-polariton by at least two orders of magnitude.

Henning Korbmacher, Gustavo A. Dom\'inguez-Castro, Mateusz {\L}\k{a}cki, Jakub Zakrzewski, Luis Santos
Ultracold dipolar hard-core bosons in optical ladders provide exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of anisotropic XXZ spin ladders. We show that introducing a tilt along the rungs results in a rich phase diagram at unit filling. In particular, for a sufficiently strong dipolar strength, the interplay between the long-range tail of the dipolar interactions and the tilting leads to the emergence of a quantum floating phase, a critical phase with incommensurate density-density correlations. Interestingly, the study of the entanglement spectrum, reveals that the floating phase is topological, constituting an intermediate gapless stage in the melting of a crystal into a gapped topological Haldane phase. This novel scenario for topological floating phases in dipolar XXZ ladders can be investigated in on-going experiments.

Feature-learning deep nets progressively collapse data to a regular low-dimensional geometry. How this emerges from the collective action of nonlinearity, noise, learning rate, and other factors, has eluded first-principles theories built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. We exhibit a noise-nonlinearity phase diagram that identifies regimes where shallow or deep layers learn more effectively and propose a macroscopic mechanical theory that reproduces the diagram and links feature learning across layers to generalization.

The transition probability for a one-dimensional discrete symmetric random walk under a reflecting barrier was once given by the method of images. [S. Chandrasekhar, Rev. Mod. Phys. 15, 1 (1943).] However, several inconsistencies have been reported when the method of images is applied in cases where a reflecting barrier is considered, even after the exact solution has been obtained. Here, we explicitly show that the method of images becomes applicable if the image position is shifted.

Michael K. -H. Kiessling, Boris L. Altshuler, Emil A. Yuzbashyan
The dispersionless limit of the standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied. The effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by Einstein phonons of frequency $\Omega>0$, equipped with electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda$. This allows for a detailed evaluation of the general results on $T_c$ for phonons with non-trivial dispersion relation, obtained in a previous paper, (II), by the authors. The variational principle for the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal state region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, obtained in (II), simplifies as follows: If $(\lambda,\Omega,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)$, where $\varpi:=\Omega/2\pi T$, and where $\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)>0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{H}(\varpi)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences; $\mathfrak{H}(\varpi)$ is the dispersionless limit $P(d\omega)\to\delta(\omega-\Omega)d\omega$ of the operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ of (II). It is shown that when $\varpi \leq \sqrt{2}$, then the map $\varpi\mapsto\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)$ is invertible. For $\lambda>0.77$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c(\lambda,\Omega) = \Omega f(\lambda)$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $f(\lambda)$ that converges to $f(\lambda)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,\Omega)$, which agrees with the asymptotic behavior $T_c(\lambda,\Omega) \sim C \Omega\sqrt{\lambda}$ for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $\Omega$, though with $C\approx 2.034 C_\infty$, where $C_\infty := \frac{1}{2\pi}\mathfrak{k}(2)^\frac12 =0.1827262477...$ is the optimal constant, and $\mathfrak{k}(\gamma)>0$ the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator for the $\gamma$ model, determined in the first paper, (I), on $T_c$ by the authors.

Hengxuan Jiang, Xiumei Wang, Xingping Zhou
Classification of the non-Hermitian phases in high-dimensional lattice becomes challenging due to interplay of the band topology and non-Hermiticity. The significant increase in data dimensions and the number of categories has rendered traditional supervised learning and unsupervised manifold learning failed. Here, we propose the self-attention assistant machine learning for clustering non-Hermitian phases in two-dimensional lattice. By incorporating the self-attention mechanism, the model can effectively capture long-range dependencies and important patterns, resulting in a more compact and information-rich latent space. It can achieve Altland-Zirnbauer classification with Bloch vector dataset and distinguish the phases of eigenstates' localized behavior with the competition between non-Hermitian skin effect and topological localization. Our results provide a general method for characterizing non-Hermitian phases in two-dimensional lattice via machine learning.

Jingyi Li, Laurel Ohm, Saverio E. Spagnolie
Active particles in anisotropic, viscoelastic fluids experience competing stresses which guide their trajectories. An aligned suspension of particles can trigger a hydrodynamic bend instability, but the elasticity of the fluid can drive particle orientations back towards alignment. To study these competing effects, we examine a dilute suspension of active particles in an Ericksen-Leslie model nematic liquid crystal. An anchoring strength linking the active and passive media tunes the system between active suspension theory in Newtonian fluids in one limit, and active nematic theory in another. For extensile active stresses, beyond a critical active Ericksen number or particle concentration, the suspension first comes into alignment, then buckles via a classical bend instability. Rather than entering the fully developed roiling state observed in isotropic fluids, the development is arrested into a steady, flowing state by fluid elasticity. Arrested states of higher wavenumber appear at yet larger extensile activity, and a phase transition is identified at finite anchoring strength. If the active particles are motile, the particles can surf along the bent environment of their own creation. More exotic states are also observed, including a oscillatory 'thrashing' mode. Moment equations are derived, compared to kinetic theory simulations, and analyzed in asymptotic limits which admit exact expressions for the traveling wave speed and both particle orientation and director fields in the first arrested state.

Giovanni Caldarelli, Alberto Guandalini, Francesco Macheda, Francesco Mauri
We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.

Xiuyang Xia, Yuhan Peng, Ka Ki Li, Ran Ni
To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.

The deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has become a central open concept in the physics of quantum matter, and its proposed presence in the Shastry-Sutherland model was followed by the experimental observation of at least a minimal DQC scenario induced by an applied magnetic field in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$. However, the nature of the plaquette-singlet phase in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ remains unresolved, and with it the identification of the DQCP symmetry from among several theoretical scenarios. Here we perform detailed high-pressure $^{11}$B NMR studies to reveal the presence of both the full-plaquette (FP) and empty-plaquette (EP) phases in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, phase-separated at a first-order, pressure-driven transition with a volume-fraction effect. The field-driven transition from the EP to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase complements our previous observations of the FP--AFM transition, with both showing deconfined quantum criticality, while the scaling of the spin-lattice relaxation rate near the EP--AFM transition, $1/T_1 \propto T^{0.6}$, suggests a DQCP governed by a different universality class. We discuss possible extensions to the Shastry-Sutherland model that account for these pressure and field effects. The expanded phase space we discover mandates an SO(5) DQCP symmetry, and hence our results take an important step towards a complete understanding of deconfined quantum criticality in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.

Topological chiral antiferromagnets, such as Mn$_{3}$Sn, are emerging as promising materials for next-generation spintronic devices due to their intrinsic transport properties linked to exotic magnetic configurations. Here, we demonstrate that anisotropic strain in Mn$_{3}$Sn thin films offers a novel approach to manipulate the magnetic ground state, unlocking new functionalities in this material. Anisotropic strain reduces the point group symmetry of the manganese (Mn) Kagome triangles from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{1}$, significantly altering the energy landscape of the magnetic states in Mn$_{3}$Sn. This symmetry reduction enables even a tiny in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction to induce canting of the Mn spins out of the Kagome plane. The modified magnetic ground state introduces a finite scalar spin chirality and results in a significant Berry phase in momentum space. Consequently, a large anomalous Hall effect emerges in the Kagome plane at room temperature - an effect that is absent in the bulk material. Moreover, this two-fold degenerate magnetic state enables the creation of multiple-stable, non-volatile anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) memory states. These states are field-stable and can be controlled by thermal assisted current-induced magnetization switching requiring modest current densities and small bias fields, thereby offering a compelling new functionality in Mn$_{3}$Sn for spintronic applications.

Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang
The recent experimental observation of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effects in the rhombohedrally stacked pentalayer graphene has motivated theoretical discussions on the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall crystal (QAHC), a topological version of Wigner crystal. Conventional topological Wigner crystals typically have one electron per unit cell. In this work we propose new types of topological Wigner crystals labeled as QAHC-$z$, with $z$ electrons per unit cell. In the pentalayer graphene system, we find parameter regimes where QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 have lower energy than the conventional QAHC-1 at total filling $\nu=1$ per moir\'e unit cell. These states all have total Chern number $C_\mathrm{tot}=1$ and are consistent with the QAH effect observed in the experiments. The larger period QAHC states have lower kinetic energy due to the unique Mexican-hat dispersion of the pentalayer graphene, which can compensate for the loss in the interaction energy. Unlike QAHC-1, QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 break the moir\'e translation symmetry and are sharply distinct from a moir\'e band insulator. We also briefly discuss the competition between integer QAH and fractional QAH states at filling $\nu=2/3$. Moreover, we find that a stronger moir\'e potential can significantly change the phase diagram and even favors a QAHC-1 ansatz with $C=2$ Chern band.

Scale invariance is a key feature that characterizes criticality in complex dynamical systems, which often organize into structures exhibiting no typical size and/or lifespan. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic interactions are typically required for showcasing such criticality, the question of whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely deterministic interactions remains unclear. In this work, we discover highly affirmative signatures of critical dynamics in equal-state clusters that emerge in the \textit{logistic} Game of life (GOL): an extension of Conway's GOL into a Cantor set state space that is nevertheless deterministic. We uncover at least three types of asymptotic behavior, i.e. phases, that are separated by two fundamentally distinct critical points. The first critical point -- associated with a peculiar form of self-organized criticality -- defines the non-analytic boundary between a sparse-static and a sparse-dynamic asymptotic phase. Meanwhile, the second point marks an enigmatic deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic and a third, dense-dynamic phase. Moreover, we identify distinct power-law distributions of cluster sizes with unconventional critical exponents that challenge the current paradigms for critical behavior. Overall, our work concretely paves the way for studying emergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.

[*Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13554 "Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure")
Zhi-Yan Shao, Jia-Heng Ji, Congjun Wu, Dao-Xin Yao, Fan Yang
The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) (HTSC) in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with critical temperature $T_c$ higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has aroused a surge in the exploration of HTSC in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase multilayer nickelates. Very recently, SC is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ substrate with $T_c$ above the McMillan limit ($\approx 40\text{ K}$) at ambient pressure (AP), allowing various experimental investigation on the pairing mechanism in this material. It is now eager to enhance the $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Here we propose that an imposed strong perpendicular electric field can strongly enhance the $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. The physics underlying this proposal is clear and simple. Under strong electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital in this layer cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing will be subjected to the pair-breaking effect and be suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is promptly and strongly enhanced, which mimics the cuprates. Our combined simplified one-orbital study and comprehensive two-orbital one under the mean-field treatment and the density matrix renormalization group approach consistently verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between the two layers is enough to realize HTSC with $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.

Xin Zhang, Frank G\"ohmann, Andreas Kl\"umper, Vladislav Popkov
We calculate the values of observables in chiral eigenstates of the XX quantum spin chain that were introduced in previous work and compare the form of the result with the respective expressions obtained in the more familiar eigenbasis of states with fixed magnetization in the $z$ direction. We carry out the diagonalization of the XY spin chain in the chiral basis. We calculate the norm of the chiral XY eigenstates, and the values of the one-point functions and some neighbor two-point correlation functions. We interpret the spectrum and the particle content of the XY chain in terms of scattering states of an even number of kink and antikink excitations that are created over a reduced Brillouin zone.

The quantum acoustic framework has recently emerged as a non-perturbative, coherent approach to electron-lattice interactions, uncovering rich physics often obscured by perturbative methods with incoherent scattering events. Here, we model the strongly coupled dynamics of electrons and acoustic lattice vibrations within this framework, representing lattice vibrations as coherent states and electrons as quantum wavepackets, in a manner distinctively different from tight-binding or discrete hopping-based approaches. We derive and numerically implement electron backaction on the lattice, providing both visual and quantitative insights into electron wavepacket evolution and the formation of acoustic polarons. We investigate polaron binding energies across varying material parameters and compute key observables, including mean square displacement, kinetic energy, potential energy, and vibrational energy. over time. Our findings reveal the conditions that favor polaron formation, which is enhanced by low temperatures, high deformation potential constants, slow sound velocities, and high effective masses. Additionally, we explore the impact of external electric and magnetic fields, showing that while polaron formation remains robust under moderate fields, it is weakly suppressed at higher field strengths. These results deepen our understanding of polaron dynamics and pave the way for future studies into non-trivial transport behavior in quantum materials.

Antiferromagnets are emerging as promising alternatives to ferromagnets in spintronics applications. A key feature of antiferromagnets is their anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), which has the potential to serve as a sensitive marker for the antiferromagnetic order parameter. However, the underlying origins of this behavior remains poorly understood, particularly, in thin film geometries. In this study, we report the observation of AMR in epitaxial thin films of the collinear L1$_{0}$ antiferromagnet MnPt$_{x}$Pd$_{1-x}$. In the thicker films, AMR is dominated by a non-crystalline two-fold component, which emerges from domain reconfiguration and spin canting under applied magnetic field. As the film thickness is reduced, however, a crystalline four-fold component emerges, accompanied by the appearance of uncompensated magnetic moment, which strongly modifies the magnetotransport properties in the thinner films. We demonstrate that interfacial interactions lead to a large density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level. This enhanced DOS, combined with disorder in the thinner films, stabilizes the uncompensated moment and results in a four-fold modulation of the DOS as the Neel vector rotates, explaining the observed AMR behavior.

Pavlo Sukhachov, Hans Gl{\o}ckner Giil, Bj{\o}rnulf Brekke, Jacob Linder
The symmetry requirements for realizing unconventional compensated magnets with spin-polarized bands such as altermagnets have recently been uncovered. The most recent addition to this family of magnets is parity-odd or $p$-wave magnets. We demonstrate that $p$-wave magnets are perfectly compatible with superconductivity due to the spin polarization of their electron bands and that they induce unexpected spin transport phenomena. We first show that $p$-wave magnetism can coexist with conventional superconductivity regardless of the magnitude of the spin splitting. We then predict that $p$-wave magnets induce a charge-to-spin conversion, which can be strongly enhanced by the presence of superconductivity providing a way to probe the coexistence in experiments. Our results open an avenue for material combinations with a synergetic relation between spintronics and superconductivity.

Josef Richter, Lucas S\'a, Masudul Haque
The Lindblad description of an open quantum system gives rise to two types of integrability, since the nonequilibrium steady state can be integrable independently of the Liouvillian. Taking boundary-driven and dephasing spin chains as a representative example, we discriminate Liouvillian and steady-state chaos by combining level spacing statistics and an extension of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to open quantum systems. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the steady states by expanding it in the basis of Pauli strings and comparing the weight of strings of different lengths. We show that the natural expectation that integrable steady states are "simple" (i.e., built from few-body local operators) does not hold: the steady states of both chaotic and integrable models have relevant contributions coming from Pauli strings of all possible lengths, including long-range and many-body interactions. Nevertheless, we show that one can effectively use the operator-size distribution to distinguish chaotic and integrable steady states.

Philippe Lecheminant, Yuya Tanizaki, Keisuke Totsuka
A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of two-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ models with $\theta$ terms. We demonstrate its application to nonlinear $\sigma$ models with the target space $\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian manifolds as well as the flag $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\sigma$ models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the flag-manifold $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to correspond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign which leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed point. In contrast, a massive regime with a two-fold ground-state degeneracy is found for the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ ($N >2$) and Grassmannian nonlinear $\sigma$ models at $\theta=\pi$.

Stephen Powell, Sukla Pal
We present a dynamic scaling theory to describe relaxation dynamics following a magnetic-field quench near an unconventional phase transition in the magnetic material spin ice. Starting from a microscopic model, we derive an effective description for the critical dynamics in terms of the seeding and growth of string excitations, and use this to find scaling forms in terms of time, reduced temperature and monopole fugacity. We confirm the predictions of scaling theory using Monte Carlo simulations, which also show good quantitative agreement with analytical expressions valid in the limit of low monopole density. As well as being relevant for experiments in the spin ice materials, our results open the way for the study of dynamic critical properties in a family of unconventional classical phase transitions.

Adway Kumar Das, Anandamohan Ghosh, Lea F. Santos
Banded random matrices were introduced as a more realistic alternative to full random matrices for describing the spectral statistics of heavy nuclei. Initially considered by Wigner, they have since become a paradigmatic model for investigating level statistics and the localization-delocalization transition in disordered quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that, despite the absence of short-range energy correlations, weak long-range energy correlations persist in the nonergodic phase of banded random matrices. This result is supported by our numerical and analytical studies of quantities that probe both short- and long-range energy correlations, namely, the spectral form factor, level number variance, and power spectrum. We derive the timescales for the onset of spectral correlations (ramp) and for the saturation (plateau) of the spectral form factor. Unexpectedly, we find that in the nonergodic phase, these timescales decrease as the bandwidth of the matrices is reduced. We also show that the high-frequency behavior of the power spectrum of energy fluctuations can distinguish between the nonergodic and ergodic phases of the banded random matrices.

Kantaro Honda, Yosuke Takasu, Shimpei Goto, Hironori Kazuta, Masaya Kunimi, Ippei Danshita, Yoshiro Takahashi
While isolated quantum systems generally thermalize after long-time evolution, there are several exceptions defying thermalization. A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide an experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.

Recent advances in machine learning, combined with the generation of extensive density functional theory (DFT) datasets, have enabled the development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). These models offer broad applicability across the periodic table, achieving first-principles accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional DFT calculations. In this study, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art pretrained uMLIPs can effectively replace DFT for accurately modeling complex defects in a wide range of metals and alloys. Our investigation spans diverse scenarios, including grain boundaries and general defects in pure metals, defects in high-entropy alloys, hydrogen-alloy interactions, and solute-defect interactions. Remarkably, the latest EquiformerV2 models achieve DFT-level accuracy on comprehensive defect datasets, with root mean square errors (RMSE) below 5 meV/atom for energies and 100 meV/{\AA} for forces, outperforming specialized machine learning potentials such as moment tensor potential and atomic cluster expansion. We also present a systematic analysis of accuracy versus computational cost and explore uncertainty quantification for uMLIPs. A detailed case study of tungsten (W) demonstrates that data on pure W alone is insufficient for modeling complex defects in uMLIPs, underscoring the critical importance of advanced machine learning architectures and diverse datasets, which include over 100 million structures spanning all elements. These findings establish uMLIPs as a robust alternative to DFT and a transformative tool for accelerating the discovery and design of high-performance materials.

Self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are of particular importance for the deterministic generation of spin-photon entanglement. One promising scheme relies on the Larmor precession of a spin in a transverse magnetic field, which is governed by the in-plane $g$-factors of the electron and valence band heavy-hole. We probe the origin of heavy-hole $g$-factor anisotropy with respect to the in-plane magnetic field direction and uncover how it impacts the entanglement generated between the spin and the photon polarization. First, using polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements on a single QD, we determine that the impact of valence-band mixing dominates over effects due to a confinement-renormalized cubic Luttinger $q$ parameter. From this, we construct a comprehensive hole $g$-tensor model. We then use this model to simulate the concurrence and fidelity of spin-photon entanglement generation with anisotropic hole $g$-factors, which can be tuned via magnetic field angle and excitation polarization. The results demonstrate that post-growth control of the hole $g$-factor can be used to improve spin-photon cluster state generation.

Altermagnets recently came into the spotlight as a new class of magnetic materials, arising as a consequence of specific crystal symmetries. They are characterized by a spin-polarized electronic band structure similar to ferromagnets, but with net zero magnetization, and touted as a promising platform to host a slew of exotic properties, many of which are yet to be explored. Here we study a new layered triangular lattice altermagnet, Co-intercalated NbSe$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S). Differential conductance dI/dV spectra at low temperature reveal a surprising partial gap opening centered at the Fermi level, which is not captured by density functional theory calculations of the system in the pure altermagnetic state. Spatial mapping using spectroscopic-imaging STM and spin-polarized STM further reveals emergent tri-directional charge and spin density modulations with a 2a$_0$ wave length. Interestingly, we discover that out-of-plane magnetic field can serve as a knob to tune the amplitudes of the modulations as well as alter the overall electronic density-of-states in a manner that is strongly dependent on the field direction and strength. This can be attributed to the tilting of spins by the external magnetic field, which can have profound implications on the electronic properties of the altermagnet. By providing elusive atomic-scale insights, our work uncovers a tunable density wave accompanied by concomitant changes in the electronic band structure, and sets the foundation for studies of correlated electronic phenomena in altermagnets.

Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) Metal Halides present unique and tunable properties. However, direct and oriented synthesis is challenging due to low formation energies that lead to rapid, uncontrolled growth during solution-based processing. Here, we report the solvent-free growth of oriented and n = 1 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In situ photoluminescence (PL) during deposition reveals formation of the n =1 phase at the ear;y stages of growth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS) confirm a single oriented n = 1 phase, independent of the substrate. Co-localized spatially resolved PL and AFM further validate the conformal growth on strained epitaxial $\mbox{MAPbI}_3$ remain stable for over 184 days without any sign of cation exchange. This work highlights the potential of PLD for direct, room-temperature synthesis of 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films and stable 2D/3D heterostructures.

Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.

Microstructure imaging is crucial in materials science, but experimental images often introduce noise that obscures critical structural details. This study presents a novel deep learning approach for robust microstructure image denoising, combining phase-field simulations, Fourier transform techniques, and an attention-based neural network. The innovative framework addresses dataset limitations by synthetically generating training data by combining computational phase-field microstructures with experimental optical micrographs. The neural network architecture features an attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on important microstructural features while systematically eliminating noise types like scratches and surface imperfections. Testing on a FeMnNi alloy system demonstrated the model's exceptional performance across multiple magnifications. By successfully removing diverse noise patterns while maintaining grain boundary integrity, the research provides a generalizable deep-learning framework for microstructure image enhancement with broad applicability in materials science.

Kartick Ramakrishnan, Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam, Phani Motamarri
Accurate ab initio modelling of surfaces and interfaces, especially under an applied external potential bias, is important for describing and characterizing various phenomena that occur in electronic, catalytic, and energy storage devices. Leveraging the ability of real-space density functional theory (DFT) codes to accommodate generic boundary conditions, we introduce two methods for applying an external potential bias that can be suitable for modelling surfaces and interfaces. In the first method, an external constant electric field is applied by modifying the DFT Hamiltonian via the introduction of an auxiliary linear potential while solving the electrostatic potential arising in DFT using a Poisson equation with zero-Neumann boundary conditions. The second method directly enforces the desired external potential bias by imposing constraints on the electrostatic potential, thereby naturally mimicking experimental conditions. We describe the underlying DFT governing equations for the two setups within the real-space formalism employing finite-element discretization. First, we validate the constant electric field setup within real-space finite-element DFT (DFT-FE) with an equivalent approach using plane-wave DFT (i.e., using periodic boundary conditions) on three representative benchmark systems, namely La-terminated Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$, GaAs (111), and Al FCC (111) slabs. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the two setups in terms of the average ground-state properties, such as surface and adsorption energies. The methods developed in our work provide an attractive alternative to plane-wave DFT approaches in applying external potential bias that usually suffer from the periodic boundary conditions restrictions and poor scalability on parallel computing architectures.

Shang-Qiang Ning, Yang Qi, Chenjie Wang, Zheng-Cheng Gu
Symmetry can be intrinsically broken in topological phases due to inherent incompatibilities, a phenomenon known as enforced symmetry breaking (ESB) in the framework of topological order. In our previous work, we developed a systematic framework to understand ESB within 2D invertible topological order. Meanwhile, the origin of parity violation in the Standard Model remains one of the most profound mysteries in physics, with no clear explanation to date. In this study, we explore the ESB of parity symmetry by three-dimensional fermionic topological order (fTO), offering potential insights into the origins of parity violation. As the simplest example, here we consider an fTO related to the intrinsic interacting fermionic SPT phase protected by $Z_2^f\times Z_2\times Z_8$ symmetry in three dimensions. We show that time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with ${T}^2=1$ on physical fermions is incompatible with such fTO; then, through the so-called crystalline equivalence principle, we show that the parity symmetry is also incompatible with it. In comparison, conventional TRS with ${T}^2={P}_f$ remains compatible to this fTO. We also discuss a general framework to study the ESB phenomenon for 3D fTO.

Here, we integrate a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond with scanning probe microscopy to discover, read out, and spatially map arbitrary spin-based quantum sensors at the nanoscale. Using the boron vacancy (V$_\mathrm{B}^-$) center in hexagonal boron nitride$\unicode{x2013}$an emerging two-dimensional spin system$\unicode{x2013}$as a model, we detect its electron spin resonance indirectly via changes in the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) of a nearby NV center, eliminating the need for optical excitation or fluorescence detection of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$. Cross-relaxation between NV and V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles significantly reduces NV $T_1$, enabling quantitative nanoscale mapping of defect densities beyond the optical diffraction limit and clear resolution of hyperfine splitting in isotopically enriched h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N. Our method demonstrates interactions between 3D and 2D spin sensors, establishing NV centers as versatile probes for characterizing otherwise inaccessible spin defects.

Unconventional magnetism including altermagnetism and unconventional compensated magnetism, characterized by its duality of real-space antiferromagnetic alignment and momentum-space spin splitting, has garnered widespread attention. While altermagnetism has been extensively studied, research on unconventional compensated magnetism remains very rare. In particular, unconventional compensated magnetic materials are only theoretically predicted and have not yet been synthesized experimentally. In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$ is a unconventional compensated magnetic semiconductor. Given that the Mn ions at opposite spin lattice cannot be connected by any symmetry, the spin splitting in LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$ is isotropic. More importantly, LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$ has already been synthesized experimentally, and its magnetic structure has been confirmed by neutron scattering experiments. Therefore, LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$ serves as an excellent material platform for investigating the novel physical properties of unconventional compensated magnetic materials.

Diachenko, Mykhailo M. Koptiev, Michail D. Volnyanskii, Valentin V. Laguta, Eugene A. Eliseev, Mikhail P. Trubitsyn, Anna N. Morozovska
We revealed the resistive switching, negative differential resistance and charge accumulation effects in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method and annealed at temperatures from 500{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.

Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Andreas M. Menzel
Edges are abundant when elastic solids glide in guiding rails or fluids are contained in vessels. We here address induced displacements in elastic solids or small-scale flows in viscous fluids in the vicinity of one such edge. For this purpose, we solve the governing elasticity equations for linearly elastic, potentially compressible solids, as well as the low-Reynolds-number flow equations for incompressible fluids. Technically speaking, we derive the associated Green's functions under confinement by two planar boundaries that meet at a straight edge. The two boundaries both feature no-slip or free-slip conditions, or one of these two conditions per boundary. Previously, we solved the simpler case of the force being oriented parallel to the straight edge. Here, we complement this solution by the more challenging case of the force pointing into a direction perpendicular to the edge. Together, these two cases provide the general solution. Specific situations in which our analysis may find application in terms of quantitative theoretical descriptions are particle motion in confined colloidal suspensions, dynamics of active microswimmers near edges, or actuated distortions of elastic materials due to activated contained functionalized particles.

This study employs modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory to systematically investigate the influence of zwitterionic osmolyte additives to an electrolyte solution on disjoining pressure and electric differential capacitance within charged slit-like nanopores with conductive walls. We demonstrate that increasing concentrations of zwitterionic osmolytes synergistically enhance both disjoining pressure and differential capacitance, highlighting their dual role in the potential improvement of supercapacitor performance. The insights gained underscore the unique capabilities of zwitterionic osmolytes as multifunctional additives for fine-tuning the properties of electric double layers, thereby bridging the gap between capacitive efficiency and microporous electrode longevity.

The coherence properties of optical emitters in crystals are crucial for quantum technologies and optical frequency metrology. Cooling to sub-kelvin temperatures can markedly enhance coherence, making it important to identify the parameters governing emitter and host crystal behavior in this regime. We investigate a Czochralski-grown europium-doped yttrium orthosilicate crystal, reporting measurements of its heat capacity and optical coherence. Heat capacity not only informs thermal noise limits in metrology schemes but can also reveal two-level systems (TLS) arising from crystal imperfections via a linear-in-temperature term. Below 1 K, where phonon contributions are suppressed, TLS can drive decoherence, leading to a linear broadening of the homogeneous linewidth. From our data, we place an upper bound on the TLS contribution. This, together with constant optical linewidths between 300 mK and 2 K measured via photon-echo lifetimes, indicates minimal TLS effects in our sample. These findings highlight the promise of ultralow-temperature operation for enhancing the performance of optical quantum devices based on doped crystals.

The characterization of ensembles of many-qubit random states and their realization via quantum circuits are crucial tasks in quantum-information theory. In this work, we study the ensembles generated by quantum circuits that randomly permute the computational basis, thus acting classically on the corresponding states. We focus on the averaged entanglement and present two main results. First, we derive generically tight upper bounds on the entanglement that can be generated by applying permutation circuits to arbitrary initial states. We show that the late-time ``entanglement Page curves'' are bounded in terms of the initial state participation entropies and its overlap with the ``maximally antilocalized'' state. Second, comparing the averaged R\'enyi-$2$ entropies generated by $(i)$ an infinitely deep random circuit of two-qubit gates and $(ii)$ global random permutations, we show that the two quantities are different for finite $N$ but the corresponding Page curves coincide in the thermodynamic limit. We also discuss how these conclusions are modified by additional random phases or considering circuits of $k$-local gates with $k\geq 3$. Our results are exact and highlight the implications of classical features on entanglement generation in many-body systems.

Raisa Fabiha, Erdem Topsakal, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay
The ability to switch the polarization of a transmitted electromagnetic wave from vertical to horizontal, or vice versa, is of great technological interest because of its many applications in long distance communication. Binary bits can be encoded in two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted securely from point to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Consequently, most research in this area has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short (~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not too inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the wavelength is much larger (typically > 1 cm). That makes a microwave ultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, we report such a switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral dimension) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an "artificial magnonic crystal". A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with suitable electrodes excites spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon coupling, resulting in radiation of electromagnetic waves via magnon-photon coupling. The polarization of the beam radiated in one particular direction at a given frequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by switching the direction of SAW propagation in the piezoelectric substrate between two mutually orthogonal directions. By aligning the transmitter and the receiver along that particular direction (known only to authorized users), one can communicate securely from point to point, without the need for encryption or cryptography.

Gianmichele Blasi, Ricard Ravell Rodr\'iguez, Mykhailo Moskalets, Rosa L\'opez, G\'eraldine Haack
Kinetic Uncertainty Relations (KURs) establish quantum transport precision limits by linking signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the system's dynamical activity, valid in the weak-coupling regime where particle-like transport dominates. At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the meaning of the concept of activity itself. Here, we introduce a generalized dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling and derive a steady-state quantum KUR (QKUR) expressed in terms of this generalized activity. Explicit expressions are obtained within Green's function and Landauer-B\"uttiker formalisms. This QKUR ensures that uncertainty relations are valid across all coupling strengths, offering a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis. We illustrate these concepts for paradigmatic quantum-coherent mesoscopic devices: a single quantum channel pinched by a quantum point contact and open single- and double-quantum dot systems.

Paolo Fachin, Francesco Macheda, Paolo Barone, Francesco Mauri
Using first principles techniques, we show that infrared optical response can be used to discriminate between the topological and the trivial phases of two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI). We showcase germanene and jacutingaite, of recent experimental realization, as prototypical systems where the infrared spectrum is discontinuous across the transition, due to sudden and large discretized jumps of the value of Born effective charges (up to 2). For these materials, the topological transition can be induced via the application of an external electrostatic potential in the field-effect setup. Our results are rationalized in the framework of a low-energy Kane-Mele model and are robust with respect to dynamical effects which come into play when the energy gap of the material is of the same order of the infrared active phonon frequency. In the small gap QSHI germanene, due to dynamical effects, the in-plane phonon resonance in the optical conductivity shows a Fano profile with remarkable differences in the intensity and the shape between the two phases. Instead, the large gap QSHI jacutingaite presents several IR-active phonon modes whose spectral intensities drastically change between the two phases.

Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and superior quality factor. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm the presence of resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. This work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground state properties of materials using IR-active phonons.

We extend the previously defined many-body marker for two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators [I. Gilardoni {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 106}, L161106 (2022)] to distinguish trivial, weak-, and strong-topological insulators in three dimensions, in presence of the inversion symmetry. The marker is written in term of ground-state expectation values of position operators and can be employed to detect topological phases of interacting systems beyond mean-field approximations, e.g., within quantum Monte Carlo techniques. Here, we show that the correct results of the non-interacting limit are reproduced by the many-body marker.

Reuben R. W. Wang, John L. Bohn
We study the fully itinerant dynamics of ultracold but nondegenerate polar molecules with a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom encoded into two of their electric field dressed rotational states. Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation. This work establishes a bridge between the domains of ultracold molecular collisions and many-body spin physics, ultimately proposing the use of nondegenerate bulk molecular gases as a controllable platform for nonequilibrium explorations of itinerant quantum matter.

Ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals with Kagome lattice structures exhibit a strong coupling between magnetism and topological band features. Co3Sn2S2 is a prime example, showing a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) driven by Berry curvature from the Weyl nodes. We investigated the temperature and angular dependence of Hall conductivity in thick Co3Sn2S2 crystals, aiming to distinguish between topological and conventional magnetic contributions. Our measurements reveal a robust Hall response even at low magnetic fields and temperatures above 77 K, suggesting a dominant topological origin and weak sensitivity to external conditions.

Francesco M. D. Pellegrino, Francesco Buccheri, G. G. N. Angilella
In this study, we investigate the localized surface plasmon modes of a sub-wavelength spherical nanoparticle composed of a Weyl semimetal, taking into account the axion modification of electrodynamics. We derive analytical solutions for dipole and quadrupole normal modes by employing the quasistatic approximation. The axion term leads to modified Fr\"ohlich conditions, resulting in multiple non-degenerate plasmonic resonances with distinct polarization dependencies. In contrast to isotropic conventional metals, the magnetoelectric properties of Weyl semimetals enable an incident electromagnetic field, with the electric field transverse to the surface of the sphere, to excite a localized surface plasmon.

We computed analytically global density-of-states correlation function $R\left(\omega\right)$ for L'evy-Rosenzveig-Porter random matrix ensemble which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. Using extension of Efetov's supersymmetry approach we calculated $R\left(\omega\right)$ exactly in all relevant ranges of $\omega$ . At relatively low $\omega\ll\Gamma$ (where $\Gamma$ corresponds to effective mini-band width) we found GUE-type oscillations with period of level spacing $\Delta$, decaying exponentially at the Thouless energy scale $E_{th}=\sqrt{\frac{\Delta\Gamma}{2\pi}}$. At high energies $\omega\gg E_{th}$ our results coincide with those obtained a cavity equation approach, demonstrating power-law decay. Inverse of the effective mini-band width $1/\Gamma$ is shown to be given by the average of the local decay times over L'evy distribution.

Exploiting quantum interference of charge carriers, epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide emerges as a game-changing platform for ultra-sensitive bolometric sensing, featuring an intrinsic resistive thermometer response unmatched by any other graphene variant. By achieving low and uniform carrier densities, we have accessed a new regime of strong charge localization that dramatically reduces thermal conductance, significantly enhancing bolometer performance. Here we present scalable graphene-based bolometers engineered for detecting GHz-range photons, a frequency domain essential for superconducting quantum processors. Our devices deliver a state-of-the-art noise equivalent power of 40 zW$/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ at $T=40~$mK, enabled by the steep temperature dependence of thermal conductance, $G_{\rm th}\sim T^4$ for $T<100~$mK. These results establish epitaxial graphene bolometers as versatile and low-back-action detectors, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation quantum processors and pioneering investigations into the thermodynamics and thermalization pathways of strongly entangled quantum systems.

Guan-Hao Feng, Jun Quan, Yusheng Hou
The recently discovered superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high $T_{c}$ and unconventional pairing mechanism. High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator (SI) to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.

Square Wave Perceptrons (SWPs) form a class of neural network models with oscillating activation function that exhibit intriguing ``hardness'' properties in the high-dimensional limit at a fixed signal-to-noise ratio $\alpha = O(1)$. In this work, we examine two key aspects of these models. The first is related to the so-called overlap-gap property, that is a disconnectivity feature of the geometry of the solution space of combinatorial optimization problems proven to cause the failure of a large family of solvers, and conjectured to be a symptom of algorithmic hardness. We identify, both in the storage and in the teacher-student settings, the emergence of an overlap gap at a threshold $\alpha_{\mathrm{OGP}}(\delta)$, which can be made arbitrarily small by suitably increasing the frequency of oscillations $1/\delta$ of the activation. This suggests that in this small-$\delta$ regime, typical instances of the problem are hard to solve even for small values of $\alpha$. Second, in the teacher-student setup, we show that the recovery threshold of the planted signal for message-passing algorithms can be made arbitrarily large by reducing $\delta$. These properties make SWPs both a challenging benchmark for algorithms and an interesting candidate for cryptographic applications.

Controlled quantum machines have matured significantly. A natural next step is to increasingly grant them autonomy, freeing them from time-dependent external control. For example, autonomy could pare down the classical control wires that heat and decohere quantum circuits; and an autonomous quantum refrigerator recently reset a superconducting qubit to near its ground state, as is necessary before a computation. Which fundamental conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing. Furthermore, we illustrate the criteria with multiple autonomous quantum machines (refrigerators, circuits, clocks, etc.) and multiple candidate platforms (neutral atoms, molecules, superconducting qubits, etc.). Our criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful autonomous quantum machines.

Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators.

Benjamin Qureshi, Jenny M. Poulton, Thomas E. Ouldridge
Cells produce RNA and proteins via molecular templating networks. We show that information transmission in such networks is bounded by functions of a simple thermodynamic property of the network, regardless of complexity. Surprisingly, putative systems operating at this bound do not have a high flux around the network. Instead, they have low entropy production, with each product in a ``pseudo-equilibrium'' determined by a single pathway. These pseudo-equilibrium limits constrain information transmission for the overall network, even if individual templates are arbitrarily specific.

Francesco Benini, Victor Godet, Amartya Harsh Singh
Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.

Weizhu Bao, Qinglin Tang, Yongjun Yuan
We propose and analyze an efficient and accurate numerical method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) by using the normalized gradient flow (NGF). In order to successfully extend the NGF to spin-2 BECs which has five components in the vector wave function but with only two physical constraints on total mass conservation and magnetization conservation, two important techniques are introduced for designing the proposed numerical method. The first one is to systematically investigate the ground state structure and property of spin-2 BECs within a spatially uniform system, which can be used on how to properly choose initial data in the NGF for computing ground states of spin-2 BECs. The second one is to introduce three additional projection conditions based on the relations between the chemical potentials, together with the two existing physical constraints, such that the five projection parameters used in the projection step of the NGF can be uniquely determined. Then a backward-forward Euler finite difference method is adapted to discretize the NGF. We prove rigorously that there exists a unique solution of the nonlinear system for determining the five projection parameters in the full discretization of the NGF under a mild condition on the time step size. Extensive numerical results on ground states of spin-2 BECs with different types of phases and under different potentials are reported to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical method and to demonstrate several interesting physical phenomena on ground states of spin-2 BECs.

The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute to enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles that are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence, and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first-order, second-order, topological, and localization phase transitions, have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum-enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter that can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.

Michael K. -H. Kiessling, Boris L. Altshuler, Emil A. Yuzbashyan
The standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied, in which the effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by generally dispersive phonons, with Eliashberg spectral function $\alpha^2 F(\omega)\geq 0$ that is $\propto\omega^2$ for small $\omega>0$ and vanishes for large $\omega$. The Eliashberg function also defines the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda:= 2 \int_0^\infty\frac{\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega$. Setting $\frac{2\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega =: \lambda P(d\omega)$, formally defining a probability measure $P(d\omega)$ with compact support, and assuming as usual that the phase transition between normal and superconductivity coincides with the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, it is shown that $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ is a graph of a function $\Lambda(P,T)$ that is determined by a variational principle: if $(\lambda,P,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{k}(P,T)$, where $\mathfrak{k}(P,T)>0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences constructed in the paper. Given $P$, sufficient conditions on $T$ are stated under which the map $T\mapsto \lambda = \Lambda(P,T)$ is invertible. For sufficiently large $\lambda$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c$ as function of $\lambda$ and $P$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $T_c(\lambda,P)$ that converges to $T_c(\lambda,P)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,P)$. It agrees with the asymptotic form $T_c(\lambda,P) \sim C \sqrt{\langle \omega^2\rangle} \sqrt{\lambda}$ valid for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $P$, though with a constant $C$ that is a factor $\approx 2.034$ larger than the sharp constant. Here, $\langle\omega^2\rangle := \int_0^\infty \omega^2 P(d\omega)$.

Michael K. -H. Kiessling, Boris L. Altshuler, Emil A. Yuzbashyan
Using the recent reformulation for the Eliashberg theory of superconductivity in terms of a classical interacting Bloch spin chain model, rigorous upper and lower bounds on the critical temperature $T_c$ are obtained for the $\gamma$ model -- a version of Eliashberg theory in which the effective electron-electron interaction is proportional to $(g/|\omega_n-\omega_m|)^{\gamma}$, where $\omega_n-\omega_m$ is the transferred Matsubara frequency, $g>0$ a reference energy, and $\gamma>0$ a parameter. The rigorous lower bounds are based on a variational principle that identifies $(T_c/g)^\gamma$ with the largest (positive) eigenvalue of an explicitly constructed compact, self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{G}(\gamma)$. These lower bounds form an increasing sequence that converges to $T_c(g,\gamma)$. The upper bound on $T_c(g,\gamma)$ is based on fixed point theory, proving linear stability of the normal state for $T$ larger than the upper bound on $T_c(g,\gamma)$.

Periodic driving of particles can create crystalline structures in their dynamics. Such systems can be used to study solid-state physics phenomena in the time domain. In addition, it is possible to realize photonic time crystals and to engineer the wave-number band structure of optical devices by periodic temporal modulation of the properties of light-propagating media. Here we introduce a versatile approach which uses traveling wave resonators to emulate various condensed matter phases in the time dimension. This is achieved by utilizing temporal modulation of the permittivity and the shape of small segments of the resonators. The required frequency and depth of the modulation are experimentally achievable which opens a pathway for the practical realisation of crystalline structures in time in microwave and in optical systems.

Steven Louis, Hannah Bradley, Cody Trevillian, Andrei Slavin, Vasyl Tyberkevych
This paper proposes a novel spiking artificial neuron design based on a combined spin valve/magnetic tunnel junction (SV/MTJ). Traditional hardware used in artificial intelligence and machine learning faces significant challenges related to high power consumption and scalability. To address these challenges, spintronic neurons, which can mimic biologically inspired neural behaviors, offer a promising solution. We present a model of an SV/MTJ-based neuron which uses technologies that have been successfully integrated with CMOS in commercially available applications. The operational dynamics of the neuron are derived analytically through the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation, demonstrating its ability to replicate key spiking characteristics of biological neurons, such as response latency and refractive behavior. Simulation results indicate that the proposed neuron design can operate on a timescale of about 1 ns, without any bias current, and with power consumption as low as 50 uW.

[205]. [*Geometric Floquet theory*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07029 "Geometric Floquet theory")
Paul M. Schindler, Marin Bukov
We derive Floquet theory from quantum geometry. We identify quasienergy folding as a consequence of a broken gauge group of the adiabatic gauge potential $U(1){\mapsto}\mathbb{Z}$. Fixing instead the gauge freedom using the parallel-transport gauge uniquely decomposes Floquet dynamics into a purely geometric and a purely dynamical evolution. The dynamical average-energy operator provides an unambiguous sorting of the quasienergy spectrum, identifying a Floquet ground state and suggesting a way to define the filling of Floquet-Bloch bands. We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable XY model and a non-integrable kicked Ising chain. We elucidate the geometric origin of inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the $\pi$-quasienergy splitting in discrete time crystals or $\pi$-edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the average-energy operator is a susceptible indicator for both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions. Last, we demonstrate that the periodic lab frame Hamiltonian generates transitionless counterdiabatic driving for Floquet eigenstates. This work directly bridges seemingly unrelated areas of nonequilibrium physics.

Eddy Keming Chen, Roderich Tumulka
We establish three new impossibility results regarding our knowledge of the quantum state of the universe -- a central object in quantum theory. We show that, if the universal quantum state is a typical unit vector from a high-dimensional subspace H_0 of Hilbert space H (such as the one defined by a low-entropy macro-state as prescribed by the Past Hypothesis), then no observation can determine or just significantly narrow down which vector it is. In other words, the overwhelming majority of possible state vectors are observationally indistinguishable from each other (and from the density matrix of H_0). Moreover, we show that for any observation that isn't too unlikely and most pairs of unit vectors from H_0, the observation will not significantly favor one vector over the other. We further show that the uniform distribution over the unit sphere in H_0, after Bayesian updating in the light of any observation that isn't too unlikely, is still extremely close to uniform. Our arguments rely on a typicality theorem from quantum statistical mechanics. We also discuss how theoretical considerations beyond empirical evidence might inform our understanding of this fact and our knowledge of the universal quantum state.

[207]. [*Clustering-induced localization of quantum walks on networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04325 "Clustering-induced localization of quantum walks on networks")
Lucas B\"ottcher, Mason A. Porter
Quantum walks on networks are a paradigmatic model in quantum information theory. Quantum-walk algorithms have been developed for various applications, including spatial-search problems, element-distinctness problems, and node centrality analysis. Unlike their classical counterparts, the evolution of quantum walks is unitary, so they do not converge to a stationary distribution. However, for many applications, it is important to understand the long-time behavior of quantum walks and the impact of network structure on their evolution. In the present paper, we study the localization of quantum walks on networks. We demonstrate how localization emerges in highly clustered networks that we construct by recursively attaching triangles, and we derive an analytical expression for the long-time inverse participation ratio that depends on products of eigenvectors of the quantum-walk Hamiltonian. Building on the insights from this example, we then show that localization also occurs in Kleinberg navigable small-world networks and Holme--Kim power-law cluster networks. Our results illustrate that local clustering, which is a key structural feature of networks, can induce localization of quantum walks.

Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSXS) is a powerful technique for probing both spatial and electronic structures within solid-state systems. We present a newly developed RSXS capability at beamline 13-3 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), designed to enhance materials science research. This advanced setup achieves a base sample temperature as low as 9.8 K combined with extensive angular motions (azimuthal \phi and flipping \chi), enabling comprehensive exploration of reciprocal space. Two types of detectors, an Au/GaAsP Schottky photodiode and a CCD detector with over 95% quantum efficiency, are integrated to effectively capture scattered photons. Extensive testing has confirmed the enhanced functionality of this RSXS setup, including its temperature and angular performance. The versatility and effectiveness of the system have been demonstrated through studies of various materials, including superlattice heterostructures and high-temperature superconductors.

[*Efficient Fermi-Hubbard model ground-state preparation by coupling to a classical reservoir in the instantaneous-response limit*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13862 "Efficient Fermi-Hubbard model ground-state preparation by coupling to a classical reservoir in the instantaneous-response limit")
Zekun He, Lorenzo Del Re, A. F. Kemper, J. K. Freericks
Preparing the ground state of the Fermi-Hubbard model is challenging, in part due to the exponentially large Hilbert space, which complicates efficiently finding a path from an initial state to the ground state using the variational principle. In this work, we propose an approach for ground state preparation of interacting models by involving a classical reservoir, simplified to the instantaneous-response limit, which can be described using a Hamiltonian formalism. The resulting time evolution operator consist of spin-adapted nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interaction terms similar to those in the Hubbard model, without expanding the Hilbert space. We can engineer the coupling to rapidly drive the system from an initial product state to its interacting ground state by numerically minimizing the final state energy. This ansatz closely resembles the Hamiltonian variational ansatz, offering a fresh perspective on it.

Enrico Di Lucente, Francesco Libbi, Nicola Marzari
Recent experiments have provided compelling and renewed interest in phonon hydrodynamics. At variance with ordinary diffusive heat transport, this regime is primarily governed by momentum-conserving phonon collisions. At the mesoscopic scale it can be described by the viscous heat equations (VHE), that resemble the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in the laminar regime. Here, we show that the VHE can be separated and recast as modified biharmonic equations in the velocity potential and stream function$-$solvable analytically. These two can be merged into a complex potential defining the flow streamlines, and give rise to two distinct temperature contributions, ultimately related to thermal compressibility and vorticity. The irrotational and incompressible limits of the phonon VHE are analyzed, showing how the latter mirrors the NSE for the electron fluid. This work also extends to the electron compressible regime that arises when drift velocities can be higher than plasmonic velocities. Finally, by examining thermal flow within a 2D graphite strip device, we explore the boundary conditions and transport coefficients needed to observe thermal vortices and negative thermal resistance, or heat backflow from cooler to warmer regions. This work provides novel analytical tools to design hydrodynamic phonon flow, highlights its generalization for electron hydrodynamics, and promotes additional avenues to explore experimentally such fascinating phenomena.

Silicon dominates electronics, optoelectronics, photovoltaics and photonics thanks to its suitable properties, abundance, and well-developed cost-effective manufacturing processes. Recently, crystalline silicon has been demonstrated to be an appealing alternative plasmonic material, both for the infrared where free-carrier plasmons are enabled by heavy doping, and for the ultraviolet where plasmonic effects are induced by interband transitions. Herein, we demonstrate that nanostructured amorphous silicon exhibits such so-called interband plasmonic properties in the ultraviolet, as opposed to the expectation that they would only arise in crystalline materials. We report optical plasmon resonances in the 100-to-300 nm wavelength range in ultrathin nanostructures. These resonances shift spectrally with the nanostructure shape and the nature of the surrounding matrix, while their field enhancement properties turn from epsilon-near-zero plasmonic to surface plasmonic. We present a vacuum ultraviolet wavelength- and polarization-selective ultrathin film absorber design based on deeply-subwavelength anisotropically-shaped nanostructures. These findings reveal amorphous silicon as a promising material platform for ultracompact and room-temperature-processed ultraviolet plasmonic devices operating down to vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths, for applications including anticounterfeiting, data encryption and storage, sensing and detection. Furthermore, these findings raise a fundamental question on how plasmonics can be based on amorphous nanostructures.

Koya Katayama, Ryuna Nagayama, Sosuke Ito
One of the fundamental questions in population dynamics is how biological populations respond to environmental perturbations. In population dynamics, the mean fitness and the fraction of a trait in the steady state are important because they indicate how well the trait and the population adapt to the environment. In this study, we examine the parallel mutation-reproduction model, which is one of the simplest models of an evolvable population. As an extension of the Markov chain tree theorem, we derive diagrammatic expressions for the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution of the population. For the parallel mutation-reproduction model, we consider self-loops, which represent trait reproduction and are excluded from the Markov chain tree theorem for the linear master equation. To generalize the theorem, we introduce the concept of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests, which generalize spanning trees with loops. We demonstrate that the weights of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests yield the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution. Our results provide exact expressions for the static responses and the steady-state distribution. Additionally, we discuss approximations of these expressions in cases where reproduction or mutation is dominant. We provide numerical examples to illustrate these approximations and exact expressions.

H. L. Dao
In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state energy for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ & $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.

Xiansheng Cai, Sihan Hu, Tao Wang, Yuan Huang, Pan Zhang, Youjin Deng, Kun Chen
Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.

Lianhao Zhou, Hongyi Ling, Keqiang Yan, Kaiji Zhao, Xiaoning Qian, Raymundo Arr\'oyave, Xiaofeng Qian, Shuiwang Ji
We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning, physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous materials discovery.
