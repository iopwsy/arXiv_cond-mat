Abstract: Stochastic dynamical systems allow modelling of transitions induced by disturbances, in particular from an attracting equilibrium and crossing the stable manifold of a saddle. In the small-noise limit, the probability of such transitions is governed by a large deviation principle. We illustrate a computational approach-the Method of Division-for approximating rare transition events, including their most likely paths, transition rates, and associated probabilities. To cater for realistic applications, we allow unbounded time, coloured and degenerate forcing. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on two examples: an inverted double-well potential and a simplified roll-heave ship capsize model.

Abstract: For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step, resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and resulting transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of lag time. We derive an additional expression for the transition rate, relate the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics based on the mean-squared residual, and discuss further numerical considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.

Abstract: The interplay between quantum statistics and information encoding is a cornerstone of quantum physics. Here, the maximum information capacity of a quantum state governed by Haldane's exclusion statistics is derived. The capacity, defined by the maximum von Neumann entropy of its occupancy distribution, follows S_max(g) = log2(\lfloor 1/g \rfloor + 1). This result continuously interpolates between the fermionic limit of a single qubit (g = 1) and the bosonic limit of a continuous-variable qumode (g -> 0). For the nu = 1/3 fractional quantum Hall state (g = 1/3), we predict a 2-bit capacity, observable as four distinct quantized conductance plateaus in quantum dot spectroscopy, providing a direct signature of anyonic statistics.

Abstract: This study introduces MatterVial, an innovative hybrid framework for feature-based machine learning in materials science. MatterVial expands the feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based (MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to, state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted and autonomous materials discovery.

Abstract: In this study, a single-phase nanocrystalline Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high-entropy alloy (HEA) has been synthesized by mechanical alloying and comprehensively investigated for hydrogen storage responses evaluated in details. High-energy attritor ball mill was used to synthesize the alloy from elemental powder, and hexane medium was used as a process control agent. As synthesized materials was nanocrystalline in nature after 40 h of milling with a lattice parameter of 0.289 nm body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. As synthesized nanocrystalline Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA demonstrated remarkable hydrogen storage properties, absorbing 2.1 wt.% of hydrogen in 3 minutes at 300{\deg}C with 50 atm of hydrogen pressure. At the same temperature, it also desorbed about 1.6 wt.% of hydrogen in 6 minutes. These quick rates of absorption and desorption demonstrate how well the alloy absorbs and releases hydrogen. Additionally, the alloy showed outstanding cyclic stability, retaining almost all of its hydrogen capacity across 25 cycles with only a slight 0.2 wt.% loss. The nanocrystalline Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA is a potential option for hydrogen storage applications due to its outstanding cycle stability and fast kinetics of hydrogen storage and release.

Abstract: We investigate the real-time buildup of short-range correlations in a nondegenerate ultracold Bose gas near a narrow Fano-Feshbach resonance. Using rapid optical control, we quench the closed-channel molecular energy to resonance on sub-microsecond timescales and track the evolution of the two-body contact through photo-dissociation losses. Repeated pulse sequences enhance sensitivity to early-time two-body losses and reveal long-lived coherence between atom pairs and molecular states. The observed dynamics are accurately reproduced by our dynamical two-channel zero-range theory, which explicitly accounts for the resonance's narrow width and finite closed-channel decay, establishing a predictive framework for correlation dynamics in quantum gases near Fano-Feshbach resonances.

arXiv:2509.03572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of magnetic heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic (FM) layers interfaced with three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs). Integrating out the topological surface states and computing the spin determinant to second order in spins, we derive the effective generalized Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange interactions mediated by topological surface states. These interactions inherently incorporate spin-momentum locking and anisotropic spin susceptibilities stemming from the Dirac-like dispersion of the TI surface electrons. The analysis reveals that the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling intrinsic to the TI and the magnetization texture in the FM layer induces highly nonlocal and retarded, chiral, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)-like contributions to the effective spin Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the spin dynamics is studied through a derivation of the LLG equation for this problem. The induced interactions renormalize many of the FM's intrinsic properties, but a term in the LLG equation is induced that is related to the rate of change of the magnetization's curl, which is relevant to skyrmion dynamics. The magnon dispersion exhibits modifications due to the TI-mediated interactions, including tunable magnon gaps, sensitive to a tunable chemical potential and interfacial exchange coupling strength. The results also apply to finite temperatures. They elucidate topologically induced magnetic phenomena and pave the way for engineering exotic spin textures, such as skyrmions and chiral domain walls, in TI/FM hybrid systems with tunable interactions.

Abstract: Topological frustration arises when boundary conditions impose geometric frustration in a quantum system, creating delocalized defects in the ground states and profoundly altering the low-energy properties. While previous studies have been concerned with one-dimensional systems, showing that the ground state structure can be described in terms of quasiparticle excitations, the two-dimensional setting remains unexplored. We address this gap by studying a three-legged antiferromagnetic quantum Ising ladder on a torus using tensor network methods, where topological frustration is induced by an odd number of spins along both spatial directions. Our results reveal the first instance in which topological frustration shifts the position of the quantum critical point. By studying the entanglement structure, we find that the ground state can be characterized as hosting three delocalized quasiparticles. This work builds the quasiparticle picture of topological frustration toward higher dimensions and more complex systems than those considered so far.

arXiv:2509.03575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism in narrow-band systems arises from the interplay between electronic correlations, quantum geometry, and band dispersion. In particular, both ferro and anti-ferro magnets are known to occur as ground states of (different) models featuring narrow bands. This poses the question of which is favored and under what conditions. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework to investigate spin physics within narrow bands. By deriving an effective spin model, we show that the non-atomic wavefunction of the narrow bands generally favors ferromagnetic ordering, while band dispersion promotes antiferromagnetic correlations. We find that the competition between these effects gives rise to a tunable magnetic phase and rich spin phenomena. Our approach offers a systematic way to study the magnetic properties of narrow-band systems, integrating the roles of wave function, band structure, and correlation effects.

Abstract: Moir\'e lattices provide a highly tunable platform for exploring the interplay between electronic correlations and band topology. Introducing a second moir\'e pattern extends this paradigm: interference between the two moir\'e patterns produces a supermoir\'e modulation, opening a route to further tailor electronic properties. Twisted trilayer graphene generally exemplifies such a system: two distinct moir\'e patterns arise from the relative twists between adjacent graphene layers. Here, we report the observation of correlated phenomena across a wide range of twisted trilayer graphene devices whose twist angles lie along two continuous lines in the twist-angle parameter space. Depending on the degree of lattice relaxation, twisted trilayer graphene falls into two classes: moir\'e polycrystals, composed of periodic domains with locally commensurate moir\'e order, and moir\'e quasicrystals, characterized by smoothly varying local moir\'e configurations. In helically twisted moir\'e polycrystals, we observe an anomalous Hall effect, consistent with topological bands arising from domains with broken $xy$-inversion symmetry. In contrast, superconductivity appears generically in our moir\'e quasicrystals. A subset of these systems exhibits signatures of spatially modulated superconductivity, which we attribute to the supermoir\'e structure. Our findings uncover the organizing principles of the observed correlated phases in twisted trilayer graphene, highlight the critical roles of the supermoir\'e modulation and lattice relaxation, and suggest a broader framework in which magic conditions arise not as isolated points but as extended manifolds within the multi-dimensional twist-angle space of complex moir\'e materials.

Yu-Chin Tzeng, Gunnar M\"oller

arXiv:2509.03588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the momentum-resolved entanglement spectrum (ES) of the spin-1/2 ladder in the Haldane phase, long believed to exhibit a des Cloizeaux-Pearson (dCP)-type $\sin|k|$ dispersion. Using exact diagonalization up to 40 spins, we resolve two distinct branches at $k=0$ and $k=\pi$, which were previously interpreted as a single smooth mode due to SU(2) degeneracy and limited resolution. Breaking SU(2) symmetry via XXZ anisotropy opens a spin or neutral gap at $k=\pi$, depending on the anisotropy direction, triggering an entanglement quantum phase transition that is disconnected from the bulk critical point. In the easy-plane regime, the entanglement ground state is unique in the $S_A^z=0$ sector but becomes quasi-degenerate across $S_A^z$ sectors in the thermodynamic limit, consistent with spontaneous U(1) symmetry breaking. This separation between bulk and entanglement transitions demonstrates that the Li-Haldane correspondence can fail in topological ladders, even at the level of low-energy dispersions. These results revise the prevailing picture of ES in spin ladders under extensive bipartitioning, and suggest that the entanglement Hamiltonian, being nonlocal, can circumvent conventional constraints such as the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis and Mermin-Wagner theorems.

arXiv:2509.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transition from weak-link transport to the tunneling Josephson regime in a three-dimensional (3D) Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a cylindrical, tube-like trap. By varying the height of a localized barrier, we map out the smooth crossover between these regimes through measurements of the critical current and Josephson oscillations. In the weak-link regime of the Josephson junction, dissipative transport is mediated by solitonic excitations in the form of vortex rings, which drive phase slips and generate a finite chemical potential difference across the junction. Increasing the barrier height suppresses these hydrodynamics excitations, yielding a tunneling-dominated Josephson regime characterized by phononic excitations. These findings elucidate the interplay between geometry, excitations, and dissipation in atomtronic weak links, and provide a quantitative framework for engineering coherent matter-wave circuits. Our results show excellent agreement with numerical simulations and analytical models.

arXiv:2509.03601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological excitons are superpositions of electron-hole pair states with an envelope wavefunction that has finite vorticity in momentum space, dictated by the topology of the electronic bands. We derive the optical selection rules for topological excitons in flat bands, considering different topological two-band models: a family of Hamiltonians with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, the flattened BHZ model for a single spin, which can have a net Chern number, and the flattened Haldane model. We derive the selection rules for these three models accounting for short-range interactions. We also consider the non-hydrogenic spectrum of excitons in the single-spin flattened BHZ model with Coulomb interactions. We show that for the case of two flat bands with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, all excitons are bright, and the handedness of the light that couples to them is fixed by the vorticity of the pseudo-spin texture. For the single-spin flattened BHZ model, we show that bright excitons couple to circularly polarized light, regardless the range of the interactions. In the flattened Haldane model, we find that topological excitons couple to elliptically polarized light. We obtain the phase diagram for the polarization of light in this model as a function of the microscopic parameters of the Hamiltonian.

arXiv:2509.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) method to investigate the $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a bilayer square lattice with diluted interlayer couplings. Both regular and random dilution patterns are considered. In systems with regular dilution, tuning the interlayer interaction drives a quantum phase transition from a N\'eel-ordered phase to a quantum disordered phase, consistent with the $O(3)$ universality class. In contrast, random dilution gives rise to a two-step transition: from the N\'eel phase to an intermediate Mott glass (MG) phase, followed by a transition to the quantum disordered phase. Within the MG phase, the uniform magnetic susceptibility exhibits a stretched-exponential temperature dependence $\chi_u \sim \exp(-b/T^\alpha)$, $0 < \alpha < 1$. At the N\'eel-to-glass transition, quenched disorder modifies the critical exponents in a manner consistent with the Harris criterion. These findings provide new insights into disorder-driven quantum phase transitions and the emergence of glassy phases in diluted bilayer quantum magnets.

arXiv:2509.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate strategies for harnessing quantum interference to optimize the figure of merit $ZT$, power output, and thermodynamic efficiency in multi-quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm (AB) thermoelectric heat engines. Using the non-equilibrium Green function formalism, we show that interference effects such as Fano-type asymmetries, Dicke-like superradiant and subradiant modes, and multi-peaked transmission spectra can be tailored through device geometry, magnetic flux, and dot-lead coupling to produce hybrid transmission profiles that combine Lorentzian, boxcar, and Fano lineshapes. Such engineered profiles enable configurations that balance the high efficiency of sharp Lorentzian resonances with the high power output of boxcar-like spectra, yielding near-optimal power-efficiency trade-offs. For symmetric quantum-dot arrays in square, pentagonal, and hexagonal configurations, we identify an optimal regime, $t/\gamma \approx 2$, where the interdot tunneling amplitude $t$ and the dot-lead coupling $\gamma$ yield the best balance of power and efficiency. A hexagonal six-dot configuration achieves $ZT \sim 30$ at dilution temperatures, while the four-dot geometry reaches about $76\%$ of Carnot efficiency with output power $4.74$ fW. We also find a direct correspondence between the high-$ZT$ regime and maximal violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. Introducing source-drain coupling asymmetry further enhances both efficiency and power. A scaling analysis reveals that efficiency systematically increases with the number of quantum dots, whereas power output is maximized at intermediate system sizes. These findings establish coherent control in multi-dot nanostructures as a promising pathway toward high-performance quantum thermoelectric heat engines for ultralow-power electronics applications.

arXiv:2509.03612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum impurity models involving a localized charge that is weakly coupled to electronic leads usually map to Kondo-like Hamiltonians that exhibit various quantum critical behaviors. Here, we address the opposite regime of high contact transparency by solving the model of a quantum island coupled to three quantum Hall edge channels. Using a functional renormalization group (FRG) approach, we demonstrate that the low-energy physics is controlled by a nonperturbative fixed point. The universal energy crossover in both the linear conductance and the impurity entropy is obtained. We reproduce the zero-frequency conductance and the leading low-energy exponent of the three-channel Kondo model, confirming their universality across all transparencies. For interacting leads -- a model that continuously connects to the pseudo-gap Kondo model at low transparency -- we find a line of fixed points as the Luttinger parameter $K$, which encodes the strength of the interactions, changes. Our work demonstrates that FRG methods are an efficient tool for solving quantum impurity problems in regimes where standard approaches fail.

arXiv:2509.03618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I report the theoretical prediction of non-trivial physics in a one dimensional multiradical system consisting in fused six and five membered ${\pi}$-conjugated carbon rings, known as oligo(indenoindene) (OInIn). Topologically protected electronic states may emerge in fermionic chains if there is an alternation in the coupling of adjacent unpaired electrons, being described effectively by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Class-II OInIn isomers act as tight-binding chains in the non-interacting regime, thus we can expect the emergence of SSH physics in an OInIn produced by the combination of two isomers that belong to this class. That is the case of the system studied in this manuscript, whose calculated non-interacting band structure shows a gap opening compared to the gapless pure isomeric forms, hosting ingap localized states at the chain termini depending on the termination, and a non-zero Zak phase that confirms the non-trivial topology. These results were consistent with spin unrestricted mean-field Hubbard and density functional theory calculations, showing antiferromagnetic unquenched local magnetic moments at the pentagons, and strong edge localization depending on the termination. This work advances in the understanding of the physics of non-alternant multiradical ${\pi}$-conjugated hydrocarbons.

Abstract: The Rashba effect, which plays a crucial role in fundamental materials physics and potential spintronics applications, has been engineered in diverse systems, including semiconductor quantum wells, oxide heterostructures, metallic surfaces, topological insulators, ferroelectrics, etc. However, generating it in systems that preserve bulk inversion symmetry (BIS), for example, in bulk metals, has not been possible so far. We demonstrate a unique strategy to introduce and tune Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) to unprecedented magnitudes in inversion-symmetric solids, by incorporating ultra-small silver nanoparticles in bulk gold. The near-identical lattice constants of Ag and Au allowed dense packing of the Ag/Au hetero-interfaces without compromising the global BIS. By varying the density of embedded nanoparticles, we generate Rashba SOI in a bulk metal with a coupling strength of ~15 meV.Angstrom, higher than any known system preserving BIS globally, and up to ~20 times increase in the spin-orbit scattering rate. We argue that the combined effect of charge-transfer at the interfaces and polaronic localization enhances the SOI.

arXiv:2509.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing higher-order topological phases directly from the one-particle density matrix, without any reference to an underlying Hamiltonian. Our approach extends the mode-shell correspondence, originally formulated for single-particle Hamiltonians, to Gaussian states subject to chiral constraints. In this correspondence, the mode index counts topological boundary modes, while the shell index quantifies the bulk topology in a surrounding region, providing a bulk-boundary diagnostic. In one-dimensional topological insulators, the shell index reduces to the local chiral marker, recovering the winding number in the translation-invariant limit. We apply the mode-shell correspondence to a $C_4$-symmetric higher-order topological insulator with a chiral constraint and show that a fractional shell index implies that the higher-order phase is intrinsic. The one-particle density matrix is formulated in real space, so the mode-shell correspondence applies to models without translation invariance. By introducing structural disorder into the $C_4$-symmetric higher-order insulator, we show that the mode-shell correspondence remains a meaningful diagnostic in the amorphous limit. The mode-shell correspondence generalizes to interacting states with a gapped bulk spectrum in the one-particle density matrix, providing a practical and diverse route to characterize higher-order topology from the quantum state itself.

arXiv:2509.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper builds on a recently introduced dynamical networking framework, applying it to model motor-driven transport along cytoskeletal filament networks. Within this approach, the networking functional describes the periodic binding and unbinding of motors to available filament sites,whilst accounting for all possible pairing, enabling a field-theoretic treatment of constrained motion in complex networks. In this application, the dynamical networking theory is introduced into a Martin-Siggia-Rose representation of the Langevin dynamics describing the motion of a motor protein and its cargo. Results are presented in a collective description of motors on a network, for two different scenarios, namely homogeneous and non-homogeneous networks. A diffusion coefficient is presented for homogeneous networks, whilst it is shown that various possibilities remain for disordered averaging over network densities for non-homogeneous networks.

Abstract: We review quantum tunneling provoked by external field driving, focusing on the role of geometric effects. The discussion begins with an overview of tunneling phenomena, including the Landau-Zener model and the Schwinger effect, both of which are essential frameworks to describe the generation of elementary excitation of the system. We also refer to the relation between the modern theory of polarization and the geometry of the system, and introduce the shift vector via adiabatic perturbation theory. Then we introduce the twisted Landau-Zener model and shown how the shift vector modulates tunneling probability, followed by several illustrative applications of this model. We also explain the Keldysh crossover, which is the crossover from a quantum tunneling regime to photon absorption regime in driven systems.

Abstract: Recent advances on neural quantum states have shown that correlations between quantum particles can be efficiently captured by {\it attention} -- a foundation of modern neural architectures that enables neural networks to learn the relation between objects. In this work, we show that a general-purpose self-attention Fermi neural network is able to find chiral $p_x \pm i p_y$ superconductivity in an attractive Fermi gas by energy minimization, {\it without prior knowledge or bias towards pairing}. The superconducting state is identified from the optimized wavefunction by measuring various physical observables: the pair binding energy, the total angular momentum of the ground state, and off-diagonal long-range order in the two-body reduced density matrix. Our work paves the way for AI-driven discovery of unconventional and topological superconductivity in strongly correlated quantum materials.

arXiv:2509.03708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sign problem is one of the central obstacles to efficiently simulating quantum many-body systems. It is commonly believed that some phases of matter, such as the double semion model, have an intrinsic sign problem and can never be realized in a local sign problem-free Hamiltonian due to the non-positivity of the wavefunction. We show that this is not the case. Despite failing to be stoquastic - the standard criteria for the existence of a sign problem - the double semion model as well as all twisted quantum double phases of matter for finite groups $\mathcal{G}$ can be realized in local sign problem-free Hamiltonians. The lack of a sign problem is not fine-tuned and does not require the Hamiltonian to be exactly solvable, with sign problem-free perturbations allowing access to a variety of topological phase transitions.

We compare surface treatments using (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) and [3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyl]trimethoxysilane (AEAPTMS), applied via room-temperature vacuum deposition, to the perovskite FA0.78Cs0.22Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (FA = formamidinium). Both molecules improve thin-film photoluminescence properties and photovoltaic device performance, although their effectiveness depends strongly on deposition time. We show AEAPTMS has a wider, more robust processing window and yields higher performance under optimized conditions. In contrast, over-exposure, particularly with APTMS, reduces performance, with notable reductions in photoluminescence lifetime and absorbance. To probe the underlying chemistry, we employ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and depth-resolved time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), demonstrating that both amino-silanes react with formamidinium (FA+) cations in solution and in the solid state. This work underscores the importance of optimizing deposition conditions to balance effective passivation with potential performance loss and elucidates previously unrecognized reactive chemistry between amino-silane passivating agents and halide perovskites.

Abstract: Dislocations are line defects in crystals that multiply and self-organize into a complex network during strain hardening. The length of dislocation links, connecting neighboring nodes within this network, contains crucial information about the evolving dislocation microstructure. By analyzing data from Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD) simulations in face-centered cubic (fcc) Cu, we characterize the statistical distribution of link lengths of dislocation networks during strain hardening on individual slip systems. Our analysis reveals that link lengths on active slip systems follow a double-exponential distribution, while those on inactive slip systems conform to a single-exponential distribution. The distinctive long tail observed in the double-exponential distribution is attributed to the stress-induced bowing out of long links on active slip systems, a feature that disappears upon removal of the applied stress. We further demonstrate that both observed link length distributions can be explained by extending a one-dimensional Poisson process to include different growth functions. Specifically, the double-exponential distribution emerges when the growth rate for links exceeding a critical length becomes super-linear, which aligns with the physical phenomenon of long links bowing out under stress. This work advances our understanding of dislocation microstructure evolution during strain hardening and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing its formation.

Abstract: Infinite-layer (IL) nickelates have rapidly emerged as a new class of superconductors. However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties in IL nickelates.

arXiv:2509.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical work highlighted unique properties of superconducting altermagnets, including the wealth of topologically non-trivial phases as well as their potential uses in spintronic applications. Given that no intrinsically superconducting altermagnets have yet been discovered, we study here the possibility of superconducting order induced by proximity effect from a conventional s-wave superconductor. Through symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling we find that interesting superconducting phases can indeed be proximity-induced in a thin altermagnetic film provided that weak Rashba spin-orbit coupling is present at the interface. Surprisingly, the resulting superconductor is generically nodal with a mixed singlet/triplet order parameter and, importantly for applications, capable of generating spin-polarized persistent current. We propose a set of candidate heterostructures with low lattice mismatch suitable to probe these effects experimentally.

arXiv:2509.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study surface plasmons in minimally-twisted bilayer graphene that contains a triangular network of partial dislocations (or AB-BA domain walls) hosting one-dimensional electronic states. We calculate plasmon dispersion by solving classical equations of motion for charge dynamics on the network links with impedance boundary conditions at the network nodes. The plasmon band structure is shown to be quasi-periodic in frequency and damped everywhere except at high-symmetry points of the moir\'e Brillouin zone. We compare our network-based formalism with the conventional random phase approximation and discuss when each approach is valid. Calculations of plasmon waves launched by local scatterers are presented to simulate terahertz nano-imaging experiments.

arXiv:2509.03801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Josephson effects in the superconductor/two-dimensional Weyl nodal line semimetal/superconductor junctions using the Green's function method. When the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an external magnetic field coexist in the semimetal, the symmetries protecting the reciprocity of supercurrent can be broken and the Josephson diode effect with the nonreciprocity of supercurrent can be realized. A high efficiency exceeding $40\%$ can be achieved with the experimentally accessible values of the magnetic field and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The diode efficiency can be easily controlled by the direction and magnitude of the field and the strength of the spin-orbit coupling. When the spin-orbit coupling is absent or the external field is absent, the Josephson diode effect vanishes but the current-phase difference relations still show strong dependence on the field or the coupling. The tunable $0$-$\pi$ transition and the switch effect of supercurrent in the junctions can be formed if the direction of the field is rotated or the magnitude of the field and the strength of the coupling are changed. The obtained Josephson diode effect, the $0$-$\pi$ transition and the switch effect of supercurrent are helpful in the design of the quantum devices based on nodal line semimetals.

Xing-Jian Yi, Yue Mao, Xiancong Lu, Qing-Feng Sun

arXiv:2509.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnet is a distinctive magnet phase, which has spin-split energy band but with zero net magnetic moment. In this paper, we propose that altermagnet behaves spin splitting Nernst effect: Under a longitudinal temperature gradient, the electrons with opposite spins tend to split oppositely in the transverse direction, thus generating a transverse spin current. The spin splitting Nernst effect is understood from the contribution of the longitudinal wave vector to the transverse group velocity. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we calculate the spin-dependent transmission coefficient in the four-terminal altermagnet device. From the spin-dependent transmission coefficient, the nonzero transverse spin current from longitudinal temperature gradient is obtained, and the spin splitting Nernst effect is verified. We systematically study the parameter dependence of the spin splitting Nernst effect, while also performing symmetry analysis. The spin splitting Nernst effect can be easily regulated by Fermi surface energy, temperature, transport direction, and system size. Furthermore, in altermagnet, the $xy$-response and $yx$-response spin splitting Nernst coefficients are equal with $N_{s,xy}=N_{s,yx}$, different from the conventional spin Nernst effect where they are opposite. Meanwhile, the spin splitting Nernst effect require neither spin-orbit coupling nor net magnetism.

arXiv:2509.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate the existence of new types of topological states in a two-component Bose gas with Rashba spin-orbit couplings. We find four types of topological structures exist in this system. First, the half vortex (HV), which have been found and discussed in similar systems. Second, the spherical wave half vortex (SWHV), which is different from the HV by a factor of $e^{ikr}$ in the wave function. The spin configurations show that HV and SWHV are both merons. Of particular interests are the third and fourth types, which are called double peak (DP) and spin spiral (SS) phases. They are both combinations of meron and antimeron, and hence named as meroniums. These two phases demonstrate intriguing spin density patterns. Finally, the phase diagram is obtained and the stability of the meronium state is discussed.

arXiv:2509.03854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological materials, dissipationless edge currents are protected against local defect scattering by the bulk inverted band structure and band gap. We propose that large uniaxial strain can effectively switch a 2D Chern insulator to a topologically trivial state. Further, we suggest that the boundary between strained and unstrained regions of a sample can act as a new edge for dissipationless current flow. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations we demonstrate the strain-tunability of the monolayer MnBi2S2T2 band structure and the switching of the Chern number. We combine uniaxial and biaxial strain results to map out the strain-tuned topological phase diagram.

arXiv:2509.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of experimental observations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors with Ising spin-orbit coupling suggest the presence of an unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism. Some of these experiments include observation of Leggett modes and a nodal superconducting gap in STM experiments, a large in-plane upper critical field compared to the Pauli limit, and the observation of a two-fold gap anisotropy in magnetoresistance measurements. Here, we propose a superconducting pairing mechanism mediated by spin and charge fluctuations and identify the dominant superconducting instability relevant to monolayer TaS$_2$. We then explore the effect of an additional electron-phonon pairing contribution, and compare our results with recent experimental findings. In particular, our theory stabilizes a superconducting ground state with nodal-like density of states that agrees with STM experiments. The theory obtains a large in-plane upper critical field due to a combination of Ising spin-orbit coupling and even-odd parity mixing in the superconducting state. Further, we find that an in-plane magnetic field splits the degeneracy of the superconducting ground state, and the resulting two-fold symmetric superconducting order parameter could explain the gap anisotropy observed in magnetoresistance experiments. Overall, the proposed theoretical pairing model can reconcile diverse experimental observations and remains consistent with observations on other dichalcogenide superconductors such as monolayer NbSe$_2$.

Tie-Feng Fang, Ai-Min Guo, Qing-Feng Sun

arXiv:2509.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a particle-number conserving theory for many-body effects in mesoscopic superconducting islands connected to normal electrodes, which explicitly includes quantum fluctuations of Cooper pairs in the condensate. Beyond previous BCS mean-field descriptions, our theory can precisely treat the pairing and Coulomb interactions over an unprecedentedly broad range of parameters by using the numerical renormalization group method. On increasing the ratio of pairing to Coulomb interactions, the low-energy physics of the system evolves from the spin Kondo to mixed valence regimes and eventually reaches an anisotropic charge Kondo phase, while a crossover from $1e$- to $2e$-periodic Coulomb blockade of transport is revealed at high temperatures. For weak pairing, the superconducting condensate is frozen in the local spin-flip processes but fluctuates in the virtual excitations, yielding an enhanced spin Kondo temperature. For strong pairing, massive fluctuations of Cooper pairs are crucial for establishing charge Kondo correlations whose Kondo temperature rapidly decreases with the pairing interaction. Surprisingly, a charge-exchange induced local field may occur even at the charge degenerate point, thereby destroying the charge Kondo effect. These are demonstrated in the spectral and transport properties of the island.

arXiv:2509.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the superconducting transport phenomena, involving lensing effect and supercurrent in AA-stacked bilayer graphene, which is characterized by a linear gapless band with two shifted Dirac cones. Our findings indicate that cross Andreev reflection and Josephson current occur exclusively within the intracone process, while intercone scatterings are strictly prohibited. The normal/superconductor/normal junction can act as a superconducting lens for the upper and lower cones. Depending on cone index, the transmitted electrons and holes can be focused, collimated or diverged by adjusting the gate voltages. In superconductor/normal/superconductor junction, due to interlayer coupling, the critical currents of the two cones exhibit distinct oscillation periods with junction width, leading to an irregular oscillation of the total critical current. Furthermore, the oscillations of critical currents with exchange field maintain a stable phase difference of one quarter period between the two cones. Consequently, a cone-dependent 0-\pi transition is achieved in this Josephson junction.

arXiv:2509.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial atoms in graphene hosting a series of quasi-bound states can serve as an excellent platform to explore atomic collapse and become a basis to design novel graphene nanodevices. We theoretically study behaviors of massless Dirac fermions in singular potentials with a general form of 1/r^{\gamma}. Different from the Coulomb potential that demands a supercritical charge Z > Zc, a high-order singular potential ({\gamma} > 1) is found to in principle induce atomic collapse with an infinitesimal charge Z. The energies of atomic collapse states (ACSs) within these potentials are arranged roughly as a power sequence. We also show that some special ACSs can exist even above the bulk Dirac point, which cannot appear in the Coulomb potential. These findings uncover the anomalies of massless Dirac fermions in diverse charge potentials and provide guidance for further experiments and graphene nanodevice applications.

Wei-Tao Lu, Tie-Feng Fang, Qing-Feng Sun

arXiv:2509.03923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic superlattices (AFSL) are proposed based on the buckled hexagonal two-dimensional materials, which can be realized by the proximity effect of the periodically deposited antiferromagnets. It is found that the AF proximity effect can give rise to valley-polarized minibands and conductance, which are not held under ferromagnetic proximity. The spin degeneracy and valley degeneracy are lifted simultaneously in the presence of AF proximity and electric field. In consequence, both minibands and conductance could be spin-valley polarized completely in AFSL. The symmetry of spin-valley polarization is analysed by considering the pseudospin rotation operations and spatial inversion operations. Furthermore, AFSL also induce a highly anisotropic band structure due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In particular, the group velocity parallel to the periodic direction of AFSL is greatly renormalized, while the velocity perpendicular to the periodic direction remains unaffected, contrary to that observed in graphene superlattices. With the increase of SOC, the anisotropy becomes more prominent, leading to flattened band and electron supercollimation. The direction of anisotropy can be regulated by adjusting the potential and SOC. These findings offer an alternative approach to engineering anisotropic two-dimensional materials. As an application, the AFSL may well work as a symmetry-protected spin-valley valve easily controlled by the gate voltages.

Tie-Feng Fang, Wei-Tao Lu, Ai-Min Guo, Qing-Feng Sun

arXiv:2509.03924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the persistent current in a correlated trimer nanoring comprising of three magnetic atoms, which sits on a metallic host and encloses a magnetic flux. In the molecular-orbital regime, charge fluctuations can reverse the aromaticity of the trimer molecule by driving quantum phase transitions between many-body states. It is shown that in frustrated trimers the superexchange-induced current as a function of interatom hopping is enhanced by the competition of conflicting magnetic orders, with an asymmetric peak at the quantum criticality separating the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kondo regimes. Interestingly, the critical current undergoes an anomalous rise with temperature before decaying, signaling the suppression of Kondo bound state at finite temperature. Our results demonstrate that the coherent current response to external flux indeed conveys important information on the states of strongly correlated systems.

Wei-Tao Lu, Qing-Feng Sun

arXiv:2509.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, antiferromagnetic (AF) materials have attracted rapid attention, because they are considered as outstanding candidates to replace the widely used ferromagnets in the next generation of spintronics. We propose a magnetoresistance model based on the quantum anomalous Hall effect in an AF system, which is protected by the topological Chern number. By regulating the AF exchange field and an electric field, the system can be controlled between the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phases and the quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) phases. As a result, a QAHI/QSHI/QAHI junction can be formed. In the QAHI region, the spin orientation of chiral edge state can be manipulated by tuning the AF exchange field and the electric field. Therefore, the spin directions of two QAHIs in the junction can have parallel and antiparallel configurations. The conductances of two configurations offered by chiral edge states are significantly different, and this is a magnetoresistance effect that can be electrically controlled. Because of the topological invariance, the magnetoresistance plateaus are robust to the size effect and the disorder.

arXiv:2509.03936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) signals for disordered superconductors in two limits: One is the narrow-band limit with sinusoidal pulse waves, and the other is the broad-band limit with delta-function pulses. While the 2DCS signal in the narrow-band limit is related to the third-order nonlinear susceptibilities $\chi^{(3)}(3\Omega; \Omega, \Omega, \Omega)$ (third harmonic generation) and $\chi^{(3)}(\Omega; \Omega, \Omega, -\Omega)$ (ac Kerr effect), we find that in the broad-band limit the signal along the diagonal and horizontal lines in the two-dimensional frequency space is related to another nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}(\Omega; \Omega, 0, 0)$ (dc Kerr effect). We numerically evaluate those susceptibilities for a lattice model of superconductors based on the BCS mean-field theory and self-consistent Born approximation for impurities. The 2DCS signals in the narrow-band and broad-band limits show threshold and resonance behaviors at the superconducting-gap frequency, respectively, whose physical origin is discussed in light of quasiparticle and Higgs-mode excitations.

arXiv:2509.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of giant room-temperature magnon spin conductivity in an ultrathin ferromagnetic insulator [X.-Y. Wei et al., Nat. Mater. 21, 1352 (2022)], we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport in thin antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs). We study the prototypical AFI hematite, known for its exceptionally low magnetic damping and two distinct magnetic phases: a low-temperature uniaxial easy-axis phase and a high-temperature biaxial easy-plane phase. Using stochastic micromagnetic simulations, we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport across both magnetic phases. Our results uncover a crossover from quasi-three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional magnon spin transport at a critical thickness, determined by the frequency or energy of the excited magnons. Below this critical thickness, we observe a pronounced enhancement in the magnon diffusion length in both magnetic phases. This rise is attributed to a change in the effective magnon density of states, reflecting the reduced phase space available for scattering in the thinner, quasi-two-dimensional regime. Understanding and controlling long-distance magnon spin transport in AFIs is crucial for developing next-generation spintronic nanodevices, especially as materials approach the two-dimensional limit.

Abstract: We theoretically propose a design for two-dimensional Dirac semimetals using a bilayer-modified Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model. By introducing new sites into the BHZ model, we engineer flat bands at the Fermi energy. In the bilayer system, interlayer coupling separates these flat bands, resulting in two Dirac points that preserve time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Two Dirac points are connected by a one-dimensional Fermi arc edge state, whose bound nature is confirmed by quantized transmission resonance peaks. Notably, the position of the Dirac points can be precisely tuned by adjusting interlayer coupling strengths and symmetries.

arXiv:2509.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the energy band structure and energy levels of graphene with staggered intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and in-plane Zeeman fields. Our study demonstrates that staggered intrinsic spin-orbit coupling induces bulk band crossover at the the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys and generates antihelical edge states at the zigzag boundaries, resulting in topological metallic phases. Quantized transport coefficients confirm the existence of these antihelical edge states. Furthermore, an in-plane Zeeman field, regardless of orientation, opens a gap in the antihelical edge states while preserving bulk band closure, leading to higher-order topological metals with corner states. We also validate the presence of these corner states in nanoflakes with zigzag boundaries and confirm the metallic phases with crossed bands through a continuum low-energy model analysis.

Our findings advance the field of topological quantum computation by providing new insights into the efficient and precise manipulation of Majorana corner states.

Yu-Hao Wan, Qing-Feng Sun

arXiv:2509.03963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that introducing altermagnetism on the surface of a weak topological insulator (TI) results in the emergence of a single massless Dirac fermion, exhibiting a parity anomaly. To explore the transport properties induced by this parity anomaly, we propose an effective two-dimensional (2D) lattice model to describe the weak TI surface. This model captures both the energy spectrum and spin texture of the weak TI surface while reducing computational complexity. We show that the weak TI surface hosts a half-integer chiral edge current under the influence of altermagnetism. Additionally, in the presence of decoherence, the Hall conductance attains a half-quantized value. Layer-resolved calculations from a 3D slab model further confirm that surface altermagnetism drives the surface Hall conductance to transition to $e^{2}/2h$, aligning with calculation from the 2D effective lattice model. Our findings establish a link between altermagnetism and quantum anomalies, positioning weak TIs as a potential platform for investigating the parity anomaly without a net magnetic moment.

Yu-Hao Wan, Peng-Yi Liu, Qing-Feng Sun

arXiv:2509.03969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate topological phases in three-dimensional topological insulator (3DTI) thin films interfaced with altermagnetic (AM) orders. Starting from a modified Dirac equation, we elucidate the interplay between the Wilson mass, arising from lattice regularization, and the altermagnetic mass, and show how this interplay fundamentally alters the band topology and boundary modes. In particular, we demonstrate that coupling a 3DTI thin film to AM order induces a topological phase transition: although the total Chern number remains zero across the transition, topological helical edge states emerge after the transition. These helical edge states arise from opposite Chern numbers at different high-symmetry points, and are distinct from both the chiral edge states of the quantum anomalous Hall phase and the helical edge states of the conventional quantum spin Hall states. The quantum transport simulations reveal robust, quantized nonlocal resistance plateaus associated with these helical edge states, which persist even under strong potential and magnetic disorder. Our results establish 3DTI/AM heterostructures as a feasible material platform for engineering and detecting helical topological edge transport without time-reversal symmetry, thus expanding the landscape of topological matter and providing new opportunities for quantum devices.

Lingyao Kong, Hua Tong, Hao Hu

arXiv:2509.03981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two-patch particles in two dimensions, we find that the coupling of anisotropic patchy interactions and the triangular lattice leads to novel phase behaviors. For asymmetric patch-patch (PP) and nonpatch-nonpatch (NN) interactions, the system has dual orientationally ordered phases of the same symmetry, intermediated by a nematic phase. Both phase transitions from the nematic phase to dual ordered phases are continuous and belong to the same universality class, and they lead to highly nonmonotonic variations of the nematic order parameter. The system becomes disordered at high temperature through another continuous transition. When the PP and NN interactions become symmetric, the system has subextensive ground-state entropy, and with increasing temperature it undergoes two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions, with a critical phase connecting a nematic phase and a disordered phase. These results open up new opportunities for designing patchy interactions to study orientational phase transitions and critical phenomena.

Yu-Fei Sun, Yue Mao, Qing-Feng Sun

arXiv:2509.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a universal superconducting diode device based on double magnetic impurities which are coupled to the connection region of the Josephson junction. The positive and negative currents flowing across the junction can generate opposite magnetic fields, flipping the magnetic moment of the side magnetic impurity to the opposite directions, and in turn, the two impurities will have different impacts on the opposite currents. This results in the phenomenon that the positive and negative critical currents are unequal, referred to as the superconducting diode effect (SDE). Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method (NEGF), we obtain the direction-dependent critical currents. We confirm the emergency of the SDE and demonstrate the dependence of the superconducting diode efficiency on a range of parameters including the magnitude, the direction, and the position of the magnetic moment. Besides, we systematically analyze the symmetry relations of the nonreciprocity in our system. Our proposal has high practicability by avoiding the demand on the external magnetic field, the Cooper pair momentum, and the spin-orbit coupling. Our approach opens up new possibilities for the development of nonreciprocal electronic circuits and provides an alternate perspective on the advancement of superconducting devices.

Our findings rule out the previously proposed charge-disproportionation, suggest an intricate interplay between Mott physics and the formation of interlayer singlets, and also hint at a possible explanation of the observed intratrimer scissoring distortion. We suggest that the physics of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ should be understood in the context of weakly coupled Hubbard dimers.

Abstract: We study the band structure and transport property of a zigzag silicene nanoribbon when the electric fields are applied to the edges. It is found that a band bending could be induced and controlled by the antisymmetric edge fields, which can be understood based on the wave functions of the edge states. The highest valence band and the lowest conduction band coexist in the band bending region. With the narrowing of edge potentials, the bending increases gradually. When the edge fields become symmetric, an asymmetric band gap at the Dirac points can be obtained due to the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction, suggesting a valley polarized quantum spin Hall state. The gap could reach a maximum value rapidly and then decrease slowly as the electric fields increase. Due to the combining effect of the band bending, band selective rule, and resonant states, many zero-conductance resonances and resonance peaks appear in different regions, which could be described by the Fano resonance effect. Furthermore, the band bending and zero-conductance resonances are robust against the Hubbard interaction. The Hubbard interaction could work as a spin-dependent edge field, together with the edge electric fields, leading to a spin-dependent band gap and various quantum phases such as metal and half-metal.

Abstract: DNA and other biopolymers are being investigated as new computing substrates and alternative to silicon-based digital computers. However, the established top-down design of biomolecular interaction networks remains challenging and does not fully exploit biomolecular self-assembly capabilities. Outside of the field of computation directed evolution has been used as a tool for goal directed optimization of DNA sequences. Here, we propose integrating directed evolution with DNA-based reservoir computing to enable in-material optimization and adaptation. Simulations of colloidal beads networks connected via DNA strands demonstrate a physical reservoir capable of non-linear time-series prediction tasks, including Volterra series and Mackey-Glass chaotic dynamics. Reservoir computing performance, quantified by normalized mean squared error (NMSE), strongly depends on network topology, suggesting task-specific optimal network configurations. Implementing genetic algorithms to evolve DNA-encoded network connectivity effectively identified well-performing reservoir networks. Directed evolution improved reservoir performance across multiple tasks, outperforming random network selection. Remarkably, sequential training on distinct tasks resulted in reservoir populations maintaining performance on prior tasks. Our findings indicate DNA-bead networks offer sufficient complexity for reservoir computing, and that directed evolution robustly optimizes performance.

Abstract: The magnetic doublet ground state (GS) of a quantum dot (QD) could be changed to a spin-singlet GS by coupling to a superconductor. In analogy, here we study the GS phase transitions in QD-Majorana zero mode (MZM) coupling systems: GS behaves phase transition versus intra-dot energy level and QD-MZM coupling strength. The phase diagrams of GS are obtained, for cases with and without Zeeman term. Along with the phase transition, we also study the change of spin feature and density of states. The properties of the phase transition are understood via a mean-field picture. Our study not only serves as an analogue to QD-superconductor phase transitions, but also gives alternative explanations on MZM-relevant experiments.

Abstract: We study the subgap transport through the antiferromagnet/superconductor (AF/S) and antiferromagnet/superconductor/antiferromagnet (AF/S/AF) junctions controlled by electric field in a generic buckled honeycomb system, such as silicene, germanene, and stanene. In the present of electric field and antiferromagnetic exchange field, the spin-valley polarized half metallic phase can be achieved in the honeycomb system due to the spin-orbit coupling, which affords an opportunity to generate the pure crossed Andreev reflection (CAR). It is found that the pure CAR can be generated without local Andreev reflection (AR) and elastic cotunneling (EC) over a wide range of electric field. A spin-valley switch effect can be realized between the pure CAR and the pure EC by adjusting the electric field. The properties of AR process and CAR process strongly depend on the spin-valley polarized states. Our results suggest that the device can implement an electrical measurement of the CAR process and spin-valley switch.

Abstract: Intraatomic orbital hybridization and interatomic bond formation are the two fundamental processes when real atoms are condensed to form matter. Artificial atoms mimic real atoms by demonstrating discrete energy levels attributable to quantum confinement. As such, they offer a solid-state analogue for simulating intraatomic orbital hybridization and interatomic bond formation. Signatures of interatomic bond formation has been extensively observed in various artificial atoms. However, direct evidence of the intraatomic orbital hybridization in the artificial atoms remains to be experimentally demonstrated. Here we, for the first time, realize the orbital hybridization in artificial atoms by altering the shape of the artificial atoms. The anisotropy of the confining potential gives rise to the hybridization between quasibound states with different orbital quantum numbers within the artificial atom. These hybridized orbits are directly visualized in real space in our experiment and are well reproduced by both numerical calculations and analytical derivations. Our study opens an avenue for designing artificial matter that cannot be accessed on real atoms through experiments. Moreover, the results obtained inspire the progressive control of quantum states in diverse systems.

arXiv:2509.04015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an unconventional magnet, altermagnetism attracts great interest in condensed matter physics and applies a new research platform for the spintronics. Since the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect is an important research aspect in spintronics, we theoretically propose a universal altermagnetic sandwich device to achieve the TMR effect and investigate its transport properties. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method and the Landauer-B\"uttiker formula, we obtain the conductance and the TMR ratio. By systematically rotating the orientations of the altermagnet and spin, we investigate how the altermagnetic orientations affect the conductance and the TMR ratio, and comprehensively demonstrate the dependence of the conductance and the TMR ratio on a range of parameters in the system. By tuning the altermagnetism strength and the Fermi energy, as well as rotating the orientations in the altermagnet, the TMR ratio can reach a value of over 1000%. In addition, we analyze the detailed symmetry relations of the conductance and the TMR ratio in our system. Our approach provides a new design concept for the next-generation information technologies based on the altermagnetic platform, paving the way for the development of spintronics applications.

arXiv:2509.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the tight-binding formalism, we study the effect of side potential on the spin and valley related electronic property of $2$D honeycomb lattices with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, such as silicene and germanene. The side potential is composed of potential field and exchange field applied on the boundaries of the zigzag nanoribbon. It is found that the side potential could greatly affect the helical edge states with different spin indices and the spin and valley are locked to each other. By adjusting the side potential and ribbon width, the system shows quantum spin-valley Hall effect, valley polarized quantum spin Hall effect, and spin polarized quantum anomalous Hall effect. Due to the side potential and the coupling of edge states in narrow ribbon, a band gap could be opened for specific spin and the time-reversal symmetry could be broken, leading to a spin polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase. Various kinds of spin-valley polarized edge states are formed at the two boundaries. Furthermore, the spin-valley polarized insulating states can be used to realize a perfect spin-valley switch.

Abstract: Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density $w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed Digital Hydrogen Platform (\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and $P_{\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery of materials in complex chemical spaces.

Abstract: $\alpha$-Sn exhibits a rich topological phase diagram, yet experimental methods to tune and distinguish these phases remain limited. Here, we investigated the helicity-dependent photocurrent (HDPC) in $\alpha$-Sn films of varying thickness grown on CdTe(110) by molecular beam epitaxy. The HDPC of the 5 nm $\alpha$-Sn film shows an odd-function dependence on incident angle, whereas that of the 10 and 30 nm films exhibit an even-function dependence. Combined with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), point-group symmetry analysis, and first-principles calculations, it is revealed that a thickness-driven topological phase transition from a two dimensional (2D) to a three dimensional (3D) topological insulator occurs between 5 and 10 nm. These results demonstrate that HDPC serves as a sensitive diagnostic tool for topological phase transitions. The tunable electronic properties of $\alpha$-Sn(110) films enable thickness- and strain-mediated control of topological states, establishing a versatile platform for exploring emerging topological phenomena and developing spin-based devices.

Abstract: Twisted van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a promising platform for exploring the exotic quantum phenomena and engineering the novel material properties in two dimensions, which could bring revolutionary developments in spintronics. This Review aims at providing an overview of recent progress on emerging moir\'e spintronics in twisted vdW materials, with a particular focus on two-dimensional magnetic materials. After a brief introduction to the general features of twisted vdW materials, we discuss recent theoretical and experimental studies on stacking-dependent interlayer magnetism, non-collinear spin textures, moir\'e magnetic exchange interactions, moir\'e skyrmions and moir\'e magnons. We further highlight the ability to accelerate the discovery and design multifunctional materials for moir\'e spintronics with the assistance of machine learning. We conclude with the most pressing challenges and potential opportunities in this rapidly expanding field.

Abstract: The subtle interplay between spin-orbit coupling, exchange interactions, and cation ordering can lead to exotic magnetic states in transition-metal ions. We report a comprehensive study of the Re-based (5$d^1$) ordered double perovskite oxide Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ combining synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic susceptibility, muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. XRD reveals that Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ crystallizes in the monoclinic structure (space group $P2_1/n$) at low temperature. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate a transition below $\sim$13 K, with $M$--$H$ loops showing ferromagnetic-like hysteresis and an unusually high coercive field of 23 kOe at 2 K. Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements detect static and spatially disordered internal fields below $T_M \simeq $ 12 K, consistent with a canted antiferromagnetic ground state determined by detailed DFT and force-theorem in Hubbard-I calculations. The reduced high-temperature effective moment ($\sim0.76~\mu_B$) and very small static moment ($\lesssim 0.222~\mu_B$) derived from $\mu$SR analysis and local-field simulations indicate a decisive role of spin-orbit coupling. Through a combined experimental and computational approach we unambiguously determine the canted antiferromagnetic order in Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$, showing that a very small ordered moment coexists with an exceptionally large coercivity. These results underscore the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling and orbital ordering, providing new insights into magnetism in 5$d^1$ double perovskites.

Eric Frizzell, Christine Hartzell

arXiv:2509.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate for the first time that a lateral impulse experienced by a granular channel can induce an inertial bulk dilation over long distances across a granular medium with a mechanically free surface. The surface dilation requires zero overburden pressure (exposure to vacuum) and is precipitated by the passing of waves traveling barely above the sound speed (> Mach 1.05). We simulate this phenomenon using open source Soft Sphere Discrete Element Method (SSDEM) software. We prepare channels of monodisperse, cohesive spherical particles exposed to vacuum and modeled as Hertzian springs. We validate our model by recreating acoustic wave, strong shock, and shear dilation behavior. We then create shocks within the channel to determine the sensitivity of surface dilation to wave speed, wave type, initial packing fraction, and boundary effects. The shocks we create undergo a rapid decay in strength and appear to propagate as solitary waves that can be sustained across the channel. We find that an inertial surface dilation is induced by compressive solitary waves, is insensitive to channel length, increases with bed height, and increases substantially with initial packing fraction. A hard subsurface floor is required to maintain this wave over the entire channel. Free surface dilation induced by laterally propagating impulse loading could be implicated in the formation of Lunar Cold Spots, distal regions of low thermal inertia surrounding young craters on the Moon.

Abstract: Macromolecular crowding plays a crucial role in modulating protein dynamics in cellular and in vitro environments. Polymeric crowders such as dextran and Ficoll are known to induce entropic forces, including depletion interactions, that promote structural organization, but the nanoscale consequences for protein dynamics remain less well understood. Here, we employ megahertz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European XFEL to probe the dynamics of the protein ferritin in solutions containing sucrose, dextran, and Ficoll. We find that depletion-driven short-range attractions combined with long-range repulsions give rise to intermediate-range order (IRO) once the polysaccharide overlap concentration $c^*$ is exceeded. These IRO features fluctuate on microsecond to millisecond timescales, strongly modulating the collective dynamics of ferritin. The magnitude of these effects depends sensitively on crowder type, concentration, and molecular weight. Normalizing the crowder concentration by $c^*$ reveals scaling behavior in ferritin self-diffusion with a crossover near 2$c^*$, marking a transition from depletion-enhanced mobility to viscosity-dominated slowing. Our results demonstrate that bulk properties alone cannot account for protein dynamics in crowded solutions, underscoring the need to include polymer-specific interactions and depletion theory in models of crowded environments.

Abstract: We show that in classical spin systems the precise nature of the late-time hydrodynamic tails of the autocorrelation functions of a generic observable is determined by (i) the dynamical critical exponent and (ii) the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the corresponding observable.

Adam Morawiec

arXiv:2509.04109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of grain boundary energy are essential for predicting the behavior of polycrystalline materials. Typical models represent the minimum boundary energy as a function of macroscopic boundary parameters. An energy model may allow for boundary dissociation, i.e., for a further reduction of the overall energy by splitting a boundary into two boundaries parallel to the original one. Such splitting is prevented by constraining the energy model with inequalities opposite to the boundary wetting condition. The inequalities are applicable only to triplets of boundaries that match the assumed geometric configuration. Relationships connecting the parameters of such boundaries are derived, implications of the inequalities that prevent boundary splitting are considered, and an example energy model is shown to allow boundary decomposition. Knowing whether a given energy model permits boundary dissociation and which boundaries can be affected is important for evaluating its performance in polycrystal simulations.

arXiv:2509.04138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of biological shells, such as cell nuclei, membranes, and vesicles, often deviates from a perfect sphere due to an interplay of complex interactions with a myriad of molecular structures. In particular, semiflexible biopolymers adsorbed to the surfaces of such shells seem to affect their morphological properties. While the effect of a single, long, semiflexible chain is relatively well characterized, the mechanisms by which a high density of such surface-adsorbed polymers can alter the morphology of a spherical, soft confinement, akin to biological shells, remain relatively poorly understood. Here, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how surface adsorption of many semiflexible polymers affects the morphology of a pressurized bead-spring shell, which is spherical in the absence of these chains. By varying the attraction strength between the chains and the shell surface, chain concentration, and the polymerization degree of chains, we demonstrate that strong surface localization of the chains can induce severe shape distortions and shrinkage, depending on the chain length and concentration. Conversely, weak localization does not induce significant shape fluctuations, yet nematically ordered phases appear on the surface. Notably, these ordered phases lead to elliptic shell shapes for chains with sizes comparable to or longer than the radius of the confinement when the elastic shell is composed of extensible, harmonic bonds. Overall, our findings offer a strategy to control the shape of synthetic shells by manipulating peripheral localization and length of semiflexible polymers while suggesting a mechanism for non-spherical shapes appearing in some biological systems.

Abstract: Kitaev magnets have emerged as pivotal systems for investigating frustrated magnetism, providing a unique platform to explore quantum phases governed by the interplay between bond-dependent anisotropy and external magnetic fields. However, the quantum phase diagrams, particularly near the dominant antiferromagnetic Kitaev regime, remain puzzling despite extensive studies. In this work, we perform unbiased exact diagonalization calculations of the Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model in a [111] magnetic field on a $C_{6}$-symmetric 24-site cluster. By calculating the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux density and the topological entanglement entropy, we reveal multiple phase transitions and identify signatures of both scalar and vector chiral orders in the intermediate-field regime between the Kitaev spin liquid and the polarized phase. As the negative $\Gamma$ interaction increases, we discover a proximate quantum spin liquid featured by a three-peak specific heat and a spin-flop phase at a moderate magnetic field. Our findings provide insight into the field-induced intermediate phases in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model and pave the way for the hunt for emergent phases in real materials.

arXiv:2509.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Goos Hanchen shift of the transmitted probe and show that optomechanical interference in a ring Bose Einstein condensate provides a sensitive, rotation tunable beam shift response at ultralow optical powers. Without quantized circulation, conventional optomechanically induced transparency produces a strictly positive and bounded shift whose magnitude is governed primarily by cooperativity; small detuning offsets can introduce a weak, transient sign change consistent with a Fano type asymmetry, but the overall response remains limited. With circulation, the Bragg scattered mechanical side modes split, yielding a double transparency dispersion with steep dispersive flanks that strongly amplify the phase derivative and bias its sign. In this regime, the peak shift grows monotonically with control field strength, reflecting enhanced linearized coupling and increased transmission across the angular scan. At fixed power, the detuning dependence is decisive: the shift is maximized at the red sideband condition and diminishes away from resonance, tracking how effectively the scan samples the rotation split dispersive flanks. Increasing the winding number broadens the central absorption and steepens accessible phase gradients, further boosting the attainable shift. The protocol remains minimally invasive under experimentally realistic conditions, and interatomic interactions have a negligible influence on the transmission features that set the phase slope. These results identify circulation, control power, and cavity detuning as practical knobs for in situ control of the Goos Hanchen shift, enabling interferometric beam steering and phase gradient metrology in hybrid atom optomechanical platforms.

arXiv:2509.04149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplets of a pure fluid, such as water, in an open container surrounded by gas, are thermodynamically unstable and evaporate quickly. In a recent paper [Archer et al. J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 159}, 194403 (2023)] we employed lattice density functional theory (DFT) to demonstrate that nanoparticles or solutes dissolved in a liquid droplet can make it thermodynamically stable against evaporation. In this study, we extend our model by using continuum DFT, which allows for a more accurate description of the fluid and nanoparticle density distributions within the droplet and enables us to consider size ratios between nanoparticles and solvent particles up to 10:1. While the results of the continuum DFT agrees well with those of our earlier lattice DFT findings, our approach here allows us to refine our understanding of the stability and structure of nanoparticle laden droplets. This is particularly relevant in light of the recent global COVID-19 pandemic, which has underscored the critical role of aerosol particles in virus transmission. Understanding the stability and lifetime of these viron-laden aerosols is crucial for assessing their impact on airborne disease spread.

arXiv:2509.04164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyse the kinetic random-field nonreciprocal Ising model, which incorporates bimodal disorder along with pairwise nonreciprocal interactions between two different species. Using mean-field and effective-field theory, in combination with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations (3D Glauber dynamics), we identify a nonequilibrium tricritical (Bautin) point separating Hopf-type transitions (continuous) from saddle-node-of-limit-cycle (SNLC) transitions (discontinuous). For a weak random field which is less than a critical value, the onset of collective oscillations (the "swap" phase) occurs via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, whereas for fields greater than the critical value, the transition is first-order (SNLC), exhibiting hysteresis and Binder-cumulant signatures. The finite-size scaling of the susceptibility is consistent with the distinct critical and discontinuous behaviour shown in the Hopf and SNLC regimes, respectively (effective exponents $\approx1.96$ in the Hopf regime and $\approx3.0$ in the SNLC regime). Additionally, in the first-order regime, the swap phase is sustained only above a threshold nonreciprocity, and this threshold increases monotonically with the disorder strength. We further identify a new droplet-induced swap phase in the larger field-strength region, which cycles eight different metastable states. A dynamical free-energy picture rationalises droplet nucleation as the mechanism for these cyclic jumps. Together, these results demonstrate how disorder and nonreciprocity combined generate rich nonequilibrium criticality, with implications for driven and active systems.

arXiv:2509.04171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local positional disorder in soft, anharmonic materials has emerged as a central factor in shaping their electronic, vibrational, optical, and transport properties. Viewed mainly as a source of performance degradation, recent theoretical insights reveal that local disorder profoundly influences the electronic structure and phonon dynamics, without inducing deep electronic traps or non-radiative recombination pathways. In this work, we highlight advances in modeling local disorder using polymorphous and anharmonic frameworks, showing how these methods explain experimental observations and predict new trends. We emphasize the role of disorder in the breakdown of the phonon quasiparticle picture and in modulating electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions, particularly in soft, anharmonic phases of matter, with significant effects on electrical and thermal transport. We outline opportunities for integrating these insights into predictive modeling for energy materials and propose combining advanced first-principles methods with machine learning.

Abstract: The active layer in a perovskite solar cell is usually composed of a polycrystalline thin film. Fabrication of this layer by solution processing is a promising candidate for up-scaling to the mass market. However, the evolution of an evaporating and simultaneously crystallizing thin film is not yet fully understood. To contribute to the understanding of the formation of thin films, we develop a geometrical model that deals with the effect of the interplay between solvent evaporation and crystal growth on the dry film morphology. The possible film formation mechanisms are investigated, depending on the processing conditions. We find eleven formation pathways leading to four distinct morphologies. It is shown how these formation pathways can be utilized by adapting the process parameters to the material properties. Pinhole-free and flat films can be fabricated if the evaporation rate is high in comparison to the crystal growth rate. Alternatively, providing a high crystal number density on the substrate can lead to the desired film morphology at low drying rates.

Abstract: For decades, semiconductors and their heterostructures have underpinned both fundamental and applied research across all areas of electronics. Two-dimensional, 2D (atomically thin) semiconductors have now the potential to push further the miniaturization of electronic components, enabling the development of more efficient electronics. Here, we report on a giant anomalous zero-bias spin voltage in magnetic tunnel junctions based on 2D materials. The generation, manipulation and detection of electron spin across a nanometer-thick magnetic tunnel junction do not require any applied bias. It is achieved by exploiting high-quality ferromagnetic/semiconductor interfaces and the asymmetric diffusion of spin-up/spin-down electrons across a semiconductor p-n junction. The large spin-voltage signal exceeds 30,000% and is far greater than the highest magnetoresistance signals reported to date. Our findings reveal unexplored opportunities to transform and amplify spin information for low-power electronics.

Abstract: The detection of fractionally charged quasiparticles, which arise in the fractional quantum Hall regime, is of fundamental importance for probing their exotic quantum properties. While electronic interferometers have been central to probe their statistical properties, their interpretation is often complicated by bulk-edge interactions. Antidots, potential hills in the quantum Hall regime, are particularly valuable in this context, as they overcome the geometric limitations of conventional designs and act as controlled impurities within a quantum point contact. Furthermore, antidots allow for quasiparticle charge detection through straightforward conductance measurements, replacing the need for more demanding techniques. In this work, we employ a gate-defined bilayer graphene antidot operating in the Coulomb-dominated regime to study quasiparticle tunneling in both integer and fractional quantum Hall states. We show that the gate-voltage period and the oscillation slope directly reveal the charge of tunneling quasiparticles, providing a practical method to measure fractional charge in graphene. Moreover, we report the first measurement of the $e/3$ fractional charge in a graphene-based device. The simplicity and tunability of this design open a pathway to extend AD-based charge measurements to other van der Waals materials, establishing antidots as a powerful and broadly applicable platform to study the quantum Hall effect.

arXiv:2509.04228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic exchange interactions (MEIs) in kagome magnets exhibit rich features due to the interplay of charge, spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom, giving rise to a variety of exotic quantum states. Through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the MEIs in kagome antiferromagnets FeGe and FeSn. While the antiferromagnetic order originates from the interlayer coupling between neighboring kagome layers, Fe atoms within each kagome layer couple ferromagnetically, driven by the competition between ferromagnetically favorable direct MEIs and antiferromagnetically favorable Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions. The stronger direct MEIs but weaker RKKY interactions in FeGe result in a substantially higher N\'eel temperature with respect to FeSn. Interestingly, the nearest neighboring exchange energy in both materials approximately linearly depends on the Fe-Fe bond length, so that moderate compressive strain can significantly enhance their N\'eel temperatures.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling energy transfer mechanisms in rare-earth-doped nanomaterials is essential for advancing luminescent technologies used in bioimaging, optical thermometry, and solid-state lasers. In this work, we investigate the photoluminescence dynamics of Yb3+ and Er3+ ions in Y2O3 nanoparticles over a wide concentration range (0.5-17%), using both direct and upconversion excitation. Luminescence decays of green, red, and near-infrared transitions were measured and analyzed using a rate-equation model incorporating radiative and non-radiative processes, energy transfer mechanisms, and defect-related quenching. The model successfully reproduces experimental trends across most concentrations and excitation paths. This work provides a reliable and predictive framework for modeling energy transfer in rare-earth doped materials and offers valuable insights for optimizing photoluminescent properties in nanostructured systems.

Rapha\"el Maire, Ludivine Chaix

arXiv:2509.04242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, emerges generically from the interplay between conservation laws and non-equilibrium driving. The underlying mechanism for this emergence is analogous to self-organized criticality. Based on this understanding, we introduce four non-equilibrium models that consistently demonstrate hyperuniformity. Furthermore, we show that systems with an arbitrary number of conserved mass multipole moments exhibit an arbitrary strong tunable hyperuniform scaling, with the structure factor following $S(k) \sim k^m$, where $m$ is set by the number of conserved multipoles. Finally, we find that hyperuniformity arising from a combination of conserved noise and partially conserved average motion is not robust against non-linear perturbations. These results highlight the central role of conservation laws in stabilizing hyperuniformity and reveal a unifying mechanism for its emergence in non-equilibrium systems.

Abstract: We propose a previously unexplored spin-orbit interaction mechanism by establishing a mesoscopic many-particle Rashba Hamiltonian. In lowest order, this Hamiltonian self-consistently describes exciton spin relaxation in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) due to local electric fields caused by spatial asymmetries in the dielectric environment. For a monolayer MoSe$_2$ on a SiO$_2$ substrate above 77\,K showing a meV bright-dark splitting, the local electric field causes fast intravalley spin relaxation on a sub-picosecond timescale, whereas it is negligible for other TMDCs with larger bright-dark splitting.

Abstract: The stabilization of macromolecules is fundamental to developing biological formulations, such as vaccines and protein therapeutics. In this study, we employ coarse grained polymer models to investigate the impact of four sugars: {\alpha}-glucose, {\beta}-fructose, trehalose, and sucrose on macromolecule stability. Free energy decomposition and preferential interaction analysis indicate that polymer-sugar interactions favor folding at low concentrations while driving unfolding at higher concentrations. In contrast, the polymer-solvent soft interaction entropy consistently favors unfolding across all sugar concentrations under study. At low sugar concentrations, polymer-solvent interactions predominantly govern stabilization, whereas at higher concentrations, entropic penalties dictate polymer stability. Local mixing entropy demonstrates that binary sugar mixtures introduce entropic contributions that preferentially stabilize the folded state. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of sugar-based excipient stabilization mechanisms, offering guidance for the rational design of stable biological formulations.

Abstract: On the basis of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-H\"uckel-type Hamiltonian, we consider the tight-binding eigenvalue problem for a sequence of pyrene molecules forming a narrow $(2m,m)$ graphene nanoribbon. Specific features of the corresponding dispersion relation are analyzed and illustrated with several examples. It is shown that the $\pi$-electron spectrum of the pyrene oligomer includes local states, in contrast to the spectrum of linear acene, which consists only of extended states. We analyze and illustrate the difference in the behavior of
  the electron density distribution for extended and local electronic states. Explicit analytic expressions for the Green's function coefficients of the pyrene molecule are also presented.

Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.

arXiv:2509.04316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across development, the morphology of fluid-filled lumina enclosed by epithelial tissues arises from an interplay of lumen pressure, mechanics of the cell cortex, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we explore the mechanical basis for the control of this interplay using the shape space of MDCK cysts and the instability of their apical surfaces under tight junction perturbations [Mukenhirn et al., Dev. Cell 59, 2886 (2024)]. We discover that the cysts respond to these perturbations by significantly modulating their lateral and basal tensions, in addition to the known modulations of pressure and apical belt tension. We develop a mean-field three-dimensional vertex model of these cysts that reproduces the experimental shape instability quantitatively. This reveals that the observed increase of lateral contractility is a cellular response that counters the instability. Our work thus shows how regulation of the mechanics of all cell surfaces conspires to control lumen morphology.

Abstract: We demonstrate the in-situ read-out of the spatial profile of suspended MoS$_2$ monolayers hosted on substrates with nano-structured holes. As the profiles are spatially bent, the suspended MoS$_2$ monolayers act as exciton traps with tunable luminescence intensity and energy. The tunability is realized by controlling the environmental pressure on the monolayers, which allows to control hundreds of suspended MoS$_2$ monolayers on a single substrate. The in-situ read-out is based on Fabry-P\'erot interferences and a model of the corresponding reflectance contrast maps of the investigated monolayers.

Abstract: We study, through discrete element simulations, the discharge of granular materials through a circular orifice on the base of a cylindrical silo forced by a surcharge. At the beginning of the discharge, for a high granular column, the flow rate $Q_{\rm ini}$ scales as in the Beverloo equation for free discharge. However, we find that the flow rate $Q_{\rm end}$ attained at the end of the forced discharge scales as $\sqrt{\rho_b P}D_o^3/D_s$, with $\rho_b$ the bulk density, $P$ the pressure applied by the overweight, $D_o$ the orifice diameter and $D_s$ the silo diameter. We use the work$-$energy theorem to formulate an equation for the flow rate $Q_{\rm end}$ that predicts the scalings only in part. We discuss the new challenges offered by the phenomenology of strongly forced granular flows.

Abstract: Recent polarized Raman scattering experiments indicate that fractional quantum Hall systems host a chiral spin-2 neutral collective mode, the long-wavelength limit of the magnetoroton, which behaves as a condensed-matter graviton. We present a nonlinear, gauge-invariant effective theory by gauging area-preserving diffeomorphisms (APDs) with a unimodular spatial metric as the gauge field. A Stueckelberg construction introduces an APD-invariant local potential that aligns the dynamical metric with a reference geometry, opening a tunable gap while preserving gauge redundancy. Together with a geometric Maxwell kinetic sector and the Wen-Zee and gravitational Chern-Simons terms, the theory yields a gapped chiral spin-2 excitation consistent with universal long-wavelength constraints. The tunable gap emerges naturally from symmetry and provides a route to an isotropic-nematic quantum critical point where the spin-2 mode softens. We further establish a linear dictionary to quadrupolar deformations in composite Fermi liquid bosonization, and outline applications to fractional Chern insulators as well as higher-dimensional generalizations. Finally, the approach can be extended to non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states, capturing both spin-2 and spin-3/2 neutral modes.

Abstract: We present angle-resolved reflected electron spectroscopy (ARRES) data for the three molybdenum-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) \mos, \mose, and \mote. To follow the changes as the series moves from S to Se to Te in more detail, we determine accurate IV-spectra for monolayers and bulk TMDs. These experimental data sets are then compared with theoretical predictions for both the unoccupied band structure and the scattering density of states. We find good agreement, especially for lower energies where inelastic effects are relatively unimportant. Furthermore, we identify a series of interlayer resonances for which the dependence of the hybridization effects on the layer count is observed. Although these resonances bear similarity to interlayer resonances in hBN and graphene, they differ in their character, being dominated by unoccupied $d$-states of the chalcogen-atoms. The unoccupied states studied and analyzed here play a key role in all processes that require an electron to temporarily reside in a state above the vacuum level, such as in photoemission and secondary electron emission experiments.

arXiv:2509.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide comprehensive details of how a previously overlooked entropic, or low temperature Casimir contribution, $W_C$, to the total binding potential for 3D short-ranged wetting may be determined from a microscopic Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian. The entropic contribution comes from the many microscopic configurations corresponding to a given interfacial one, which arise from bulk-like fluctuations about the mean-field (MF) constrained profile, and adds to the usual MF contribution $W_{MF}$. We determine the functional dependence of $W_C$ on the interface (and wall) shape using a boundary integral method which can be cast as a diagrammatic expansion with each diagram corresponding to successively higher-order exponentially decaying contributions. The decay of $W_C$ is qualitatively different for first-order and critical wetting with the change in form occurring at the MF tricritical point. Including the Casimir contribution to the binding potential preserves the global surface phase diagram but changes, radically, predictions for fluctuation effects at first-order and tricritical wetting, even when capillary-wave fluctuations are not considered.

arXiv:2509.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an extended Kitaev chain with three sublattices per unit cell. This extended version is obtained by hybridizing a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model featuring trimerized unit cells with the standard Kitaev chain, resulting in a hexamer structure on the Majorana basis. Due to the interplay between the sublattice configuration and the $p$-wave superconducting pairing, a rich structure of edge modes beyond the expected Majorana zero modes is obtained. The various Majorana edge modes are further found to demonstrate considerable robustness against some generic perturbations and disorder. The presence of robust Majorana edge modes beyond their zero energy variations potentially offers a step forward in the ongoing efforts to unambiguously detect Majorana modes in experiments.

Abstract: Dirac fermions, subject to external magnetic fields and in the presence of mass orders that assume topologically nontrivial spatial textures such as domain-wall and vortices, for example, bind robust mid-gap states at zero-energy, the number of which is governed by the Aharonov-Casher and Jackiw-Rebbi or Jackiw-Rossi index theorems, respectively. Here I extend the jurisdiction of these prominent index theorems to Lorentz invariant non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac operators, constructed by augmenting the celebrated Dirac Hamiltonian by a masslike anti-Hermitian operator that also scales linearly with momentum. The resulting NH Dirac operator manifests real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, characterized by a real effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions. From the explicit solutions of the zero-energy bound states, I show that in the presence of external magnetic fields of arbitrary shape such modes always exist when the system encloses a finite number of magnetic flux quanta, while in the presence of spatially non-trivial textures of the mass orders localized zero-energy modes can only be found in the spectrum when the effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions is real. These findings pave a concrete route to realize nucleation of competing orders from the topologically robust zero-energy manifold in NH or open Dirac systems. Possible experimental setups to test these predictions are discussed.

Abstract: Hawking radiation is one of the quantum features of a black hole that can be understood as a quantum tunneling across the event horizon of the black hole, but it is quite difficult to directly observe the Hawking radiation of an astrophysical black hole. Here, we report a fermionic lattice-model-type realization of an analogue black hole by using a chain of 10 superconducting transmon qubits with interactions mediated by 9 transmon-type tunable couplers. The quantum walks of quasi-particle in the curved spacetime reflect the gravitational effect near the black hole, resulting in the behaviour of stimulated Hawking radiation, which is verified by the state tomography measurement of all 7 qubits outside the horizon. In addition, the dynamics of entanglement in the curved spacetime is directly measured. Our results would stimulate more interests to explore the related features of black holes using the programmable superconducting processor with tunable couplers.

Abstract: Isolated interacting quantum systems generally thermalize, yet there are several counterexamples for the breakdown of ergodicity, such as many-body localization and quantum scars. Recently, ergodicity breaking has been observed in systems subjected to linear potentials, termed Stark many-body localization. This phenomenon is closely associated with Hilbert-space fragmentation, characterized by a strong dependence of dynamics on initial conditions. Here, we experimentally explore initial-state dependent dynamics using a ladder-type superconducting processor with up to 24 qubits, which enables precise control of the qubit frequency and initial state preparation. In systems with linear potentials, we observe distinct non-equilibrium dynamics for initial states with the same quantum numbers and energy, but with varying domain wall numbers. This distinction becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows, in contrast with disordered interacting systems. Our results provide convincing experimental evidence of the fragmentation in Stark systems, enriching our understanding of the weak breakdown of ergodicity.

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework, the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge structures while reducing representation interference.

Abstract: Asymmetrically directed couplings in non-Hermitian systems cause directional amplification that leads to boundary skin state accumulation. However, counter-intuitively, the direction of accumulation may not follow that of the directed couplings. In this work, we demonstrate new mechanisms where this accumulation can be systematically reversed without modifying the couplings at all, just by adjusting the system size or boundary conditions in a different, transverse direction. Moreover, the reversed skin dynamics can be made very robust by suppressing the amplification in the original non-reversed direction. We motivate our approach through a series of warm-up models, culminating in a designed non-Hermitian Kagome lattice whereby wavepacket simulations demonstrate how robust reversed skin dynamics can be switched on/off in a non-local transverse manner. Our findings highlight how the non-trivial entanglement between the spectral loops of different PBC directions can be harnessed as a directional amplification switch, paving the way for new avenues of non-Hermitian sensing and lasing.

arXiv:2509.03570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are non-equilibrium transitions characterized by the orthogonality between an initial quantum state and its time-evolved counterpart following a sudden quench. Recently, studies of this phenomenon have been extended beyond closed quantum systems to include environmental interactions, often modeled through non-Hermitian effects. However, because non-Hermitian descriptions neglect both quantum jump processes and interaction effects, the ultimate fate of interacting quantum systems under full open-system quantum dynamics remains an open question. In this paper, by incorporating both interactions and full Liouvillian dynamics, we prove that DQPTs in open quantum systems remain robust when subject to either particle loss or particle gain alone, but are generically smeared out when both processes coexist, as a result of many-body particle backflow. Furthermore, we uncover a non-perturbative dynamical effect: even a weak admixture of gain (loss) into a system with loss (gain) can dramatically reshape the long-time behavior of DQPT dynamics, leading to substantial deviations over time. These phenomena--including the universal smearing of DQPTs and the emergence of large dynamical deviations in the long-time limit--arise intrinsically from non-equilibrium many-body effects in open quantum systems. Our findings are general and substantiated by both analytical arguments and numerical simulations.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum technologies have enabled quantum simulation of gauge theories -- some of the most fundamental frameworks of nature -- in regimes far from equilibrium, where classical computation is severely limited. These simulators, primarily based on neutral atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits, hold the potential to address long-standing questions in nuclear, high-energy, and condensed-matter physics, and may ultimately allow first-principles studies of matter evolution in settings ranging from the early universe to high-energy collisions. Research in this rapidly growing field is also driving the convergence of concepts across disciplines and uncovering new phenomena. In this Review, we highlight recent experimental and theoretical developments, focusing on phenomena accessible in current and near-term quantum simulators, including particle production and string breaking, collision dynamics, thermalization, ergodicity breaking, and dynamical quantum phase transitions. We conclude by outlining promising directions for future research and opportunities enabled by available quantum hardware.

arXiv:2509.03589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems of physical interest are often local, but there are at least three competing perspectives on how "locality" should be formalized: an algebraic framework, a path-integral framework, and a lattice framework. One puzzle in this competition is that systems with higher-form symmetries, which are perfectly local from the path-integral and lattice perspectives, can violate the algebraic principle of "additivity". In this paper, we propose a resolution to this puzzle by introducing a weaker locality principle, "disjoint additivity", which together with Haag duality should always be satisfied in local quantum systems. As evidence, we give examples in which disjoint additivity is preserved when ordinary additivity is violated; we show that Haag duality and disjoint additivity are satisfied in rather general lattice systems with local symmetry constraints; we give examples of nonlocal theories in which either disjoint additivity or Haag duality is violated; and finally we give examples of systems with nonlocal symmetry constraints in which disjoint additivity is violated, but can be restored by passing to a local "SymTFT" system in one higher dimension.

arXiv:2509.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in the lattice representation theory of (generalized) symmetries, many simple quantum spin chains of physical interest are not included in the rigid framework of fusion categories and weak Hopf algebras. We demonstrate that this problem can be overcome by relaxing the requirements on the underlying algebraic structure, and show that general matrix product operator symmetries are described by a pre-bialgebra. As a guiding example, we focus on the anomalous $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry of the XX model, which manifests the mixed anomaly between its $U(1)$ momentum and winding symmetry. We show how this anomaly is embedded into the non-semisimple corepresentation category, providing a novel mechanism for realizing such anomalous symmetries on the lattice. Additionally, the representation category which describes the renormalization properties is semisimple and semi-monoidal, which provides a new class of mixed state renormalization fixed points. Finally, we show that up to a quantum channel, this anomalous $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry is equivalent to a more conventional MPO symmetry obtained on the boundary of a double semion model. In this way, our work provides a bridge between well-understood topological defect symmetries and those that arise in more realistic models.

Christian Northe

arXiv:2509.03605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is analyzed in the Majorana fermion conformal field theory (CFT) in the vacuum, in the fermion state, and in states built from conformal interfaces. In the boundary-state approach, Hilbert space admits two factorizations for a single interval, producing distinct entanglement spectra determined by spin structures. Although R\'enyi and relative entropiesare shown to be insensitive to these structures, symmetry-resolved entanglement naturally reveals their differences. The Majorana fermion's $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ symmetry, generated by the fermion-parity operator $F$, distinguishes bosonic from fermionic sectors, motivating the notion of fermion-parity resolution. While $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ is naturally a symmetry of the vacuum and fermion reduced density matrices, the Hilbert space factorization is shown to stabilize this symmetry in conformal interface states. When a Majorana zero mode is present, fermion-parity-resolved entropies display equipartition at all orders in the UV cutoff; in its absence, the breaking of equipartition is quantified by Ramond-sector data. This behavior persists across all states considered. Connections with symmetry-protected topological phases of matter are outlined. All results are compared with twist field computations.

Abstract: The prediction of complex dynamics remains an open problem across many domains of physics, where nonlinearities and multiscale interactions severely limit the reliability of conventional forecasting methods. Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing by exploiting the high dimensionality of the Hilbert space, where the dynamics of quantum systems take place. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical reservoir architecture capable of handling multivariate time series through quantum evolution combined with classical memory enhancement. Our model employs a five-qubit transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian with input-modulated dynamics and temporal multiplexing, enabling the encoding of input signals over multiple timescales. We apply this framework to two paradigmatic models of chaotic behavior in fluid dynamics, where multiscale dynamics and nonlinearities play a dominant role: a low-dimensional truncation of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the Lorenz-63 system. By systematically scanning the quantum system's parameter space, we identify regions that maximize forecasting performance, as measured by the Valid Prediction Time. The observed robustness and reliable performances for both dynamical systems suggest that this hybrid quantum approach offers a flexible platform for modelling complex nonlinear time series.

Abstract: We investigate minimal two-body Hamiltonians with random interactions that generate spectra resembling those of Gaussian random matrices, a phenomenon we term quadratic quantum chaos. Unlike integrable two-body fermionic systems, the corresponding hard-core boson models exhibit genuinely chaotic dynamics, closely paralleling the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in its spin representation. This chaotic behavior is diagnosed through spectral statistics and measures of operator growth, including Krylov complexity and the late-time decay of higher-order out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs); the latter reveals the emergence of freeness in the sense of free probability. Moreover, the fractal dimension and Stabilizer Renyi entropy of a representative mid-spectrum eigenstate show finite-size deviations yet converge toward Haar-randomness as the system size increases. This convergence, constrained by local interactions, highlights the "weakly chaotic" character of these eigenstates. Owing to its simplicity and bosonic nature, these minimal models may constitute promising and resource-efficient candidates for probing quantum chaos and information scrambling on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: Recurrently connected neuron populations play key roles in sensory perception and memory storage across various brain regions. While these populations are often assumed to encode information through firing rates, this method becomes unreliable with weak stimuli. We propose that in such cases, information can be transmitted via spatial spike patterns, employing a sparse or combinatorial coding based on firing rate variance. Around the critical point of a stochastic recurrent excitable network, we uncover a synergistic dual-coding scheme, enabled by single-cell threshold adaptation. This scheme optimizes variance coding for weak signals without compromising rate coding for stronger inputs, thus maximizing input/output mutual information. These optimizations are robust across adaptation rules and coupling strengths through self-suppression of internal noise, particularly around the network's phase transition, and are linked to threshold recovery times observed in hippocampal memory circuits (~$10^2$-$10^3$ms). In contrast, nonadaptive networks perform similarly only at criticality, suggesting that threshold adaptation is essential for reliable encoding of weak signals into diverse spatial patterns. Our results imply a fundamental role for near-critical latent adaptive dynamics enabled by dual coding in biological and artificial neural networks.

Abstract: Graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) are among the most promising platforms for ultrasensitive chemical and biological sensing due to their high carrier mobility, large surface area, and low intrinsic noise. However, conventional single-gate GFET sensors in liquid environments suffer from severe limitations, including signal drift, charge trapping, and insufficient signal amplification. Here, we introduce a dual-gate GFET architecture that integrates a high-k hafnium dioxide local back gate with an electrolyte top gate, coupled with real-time feedback biasing. This design enables capacitive signal amplification while simultaneously suppressing gate leakage and low-frequency noise. By systematically evaluating seven distinct operational modes, we identify the Dual Mode Fixed configuration as optimal, achieving up to 20x signal gain, > 15x lower drift compared with gate-swept methods, and up to 7x higher signal to noise ratio across a diverse range of analytes, including neurotransmitters, volatile organic compounds, environmental contaminants, and proteins. We further demonstrate robust, multiplexed detection using a PCB-integrated GFET sensor array, underscoring the scalability and practicality of the platform for portable, high-throughput sensing in complex environments. Together, these advances establish a versatile and stable sensing technology capable of real-time, label-free detection of molecular targets under ambient and physiological conditions, with broad applicability in health monitoring, food safety, agriculture, and environmental screening.

Abstract: Biophotonics-and more recently, biointegrated photonics-offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators-optical microcavities formed in spherical structures-have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.

Abstract: We discuss in this paper the lattice discretizations of all topological defect lines (TDLs) for diagonal, minimal CFTs, using integrable restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) models. For these CFTs, the TDLs can be labeled by the Kac labels. In the case of $(1,s)$ TDLs, lines that are exactly topological on the lattice can be obtained using the centralizer of the underlying Temperley-Lieb algebra, all the other lines become topological in the continuum limit only. Our general construction relies on insertions of rows/columns of faces with modified spectral parameters, and can therefore be studied using integrability techniques. We determine the regions of spectral parameters realizing the different $(r,s)$ TDLs, and in particular calculate analytically all the associated eigenvalues (and degeneracy factors). We also show how fusion of TDLs can be obtained from fusion hierarchies in the algebraic approach to the Bethe-ansatz. All our results are checked numerically in detail for several minimal CFTs.

We identify the vacua that live on the boundary with the allowed edges of the $(r,s)$ conformal boundary conditions of the $A_m$ Andrews-Baxter-Forrester model. The boundary reflection matrices are then ``direct sums'' of certain pairs of $A_{m-1}$ Behrend-Pearce solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation and are consistent with the boundary bootstrap and the recently-introduced crossing, as well as the $Z_{2}$ (height-reversal), Kac table and non-invertible symmetries.

Abstract: Continuously monitored quantum systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum metrology, where a central challenge is to identify measurement strategies that optimally extract information about unknown parameters encoded in the complex quantum state of emitted radiation. Different measurement strategies effectively access distinct temporal modes of the emitted field, and the resulting choice of mode can strongly impact the information available for parameter estimation. While a ubiquitous approach in quantum optics is to select frequency modes through spectral filtering, the metrological potential of this technique has not yet been systematically quantified. We develop a theoretical framework to assess this potential by modeling spectral detection as a cascaded quantum system, allowing us to reconstruct the full density matrix of frequency-filtered photonic modes and to compute their associated Fisher information. This framework provides a minimal yet general method to benchmark the performance of spectral measurements in quantum optics, allowing to identify optimal filtering strategies in terms of frequency selection, detector linewidth, and metrological gain accessible through higher-order frequency-resolved correlations and mean-field engineering. These results lay the groundwork for identifying and designing optimal sensing strategies in practical quantum-optical platforms.

Abstract: Superradiant phase transitions from cavity light-matter coupling have been widely explored across platforms. Here, we report a unilateral critical endpoint (UCEP) and a tricritical point (TCP) in the phase diagram of the cavity-coupled transverse Ising model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. At zero temperature, we demonstrate that this model hosts three phases separated by two second-order and one first-order transitions. These lines intersect at a TCP and a UCEP, the latter not captured by existing phase-transition paradigms. The UCEP displays one-sided criticality: approaching the point from one side, the system behaves as a second-order transition, while from the other side it is first-order. Correspondingly, two order parameters, respectively, undergo the first- and the second-order phase transitions at the same point. We construct a minimal description of UCEP with the density of the free energy $f = c_{1}(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})+(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})^{2}\ln{\vert\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2}\vert}$, with the UCEP at $(c_{1},c_{2})=(1/e,0)$ and $\tilde{\alpha}$ being the order parameter. We further map the finite-temperature phase diagram and perform a symmetry analysis. By unifying first- and second-order signatures in a single, direction-dependent endpoint, the UCEP introduces a qualitatively new class of phase transition and may have applications in fields such as quantum measurement and quantum sensing. This work also provides an intriguing platform for exploring novel critical phenomena in cavity-coupled many-body systems with or without dissipation.

Abstract: We construct a family of static, geometrically local Hamiltonians that inherit eigenstate properties of periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics and stability of transonic flows in quantum fluids, especially for those beyond one spatial dimension, is an outstanding challenge, with applications ranging from nonlinear optics and condensed matter to analogue gravity. One intriguing possibility is that a system with a spatially bounded supersonic flow may evolve into a self-oscillating state that periodically emits solitons, in a process originating from the well-known Landau instability. Here, we report observation of self-oscillating supersonic flows in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid. By imposing a local particle sink with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial flow forming an acoustic analogue of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon around the sink. The observed superflow appears to be modulated by quasi-periodic bursts of superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and find agreement with numerical simulations of soliton oscillation frequencies within the black-hole horizon. The presented experiment demonstrates a new method for creating supersonic flows in atomic superfluids, which may find applications in quantum simulations of curved spacetime, supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating dynamics in dissipative many-body systems.

Abstract: We broaden the scope of quantum field theory by introducing a general class of discrete gauge theories that realize either topological order or fracton behavior across dimensions. We start from translation-invariant systems endowed with unconventional charge-conservation laws, which we term \textit{exponential polynomial symmetries}. Gauging these symmetries yields $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories in 2D that exhibit topological order whose quasiparticles have constrained mobility and whose ground-state degeneracy shows ultraviolet (UV) dependence. These features are reminiscent of spatial symmetry-enriched topological order, wherein quasiparticle excitations transform nontrivially under lattice translations. We further propose a Chern-Simons variant that produces non-CSS stabilizer codes and outline a framework for exponentially symmetric subsystem SPT phases. Finally, we extend this gauging procedure to 3D, obtaining new variants of fracton topological order.

Abstract: Enhancing the mechanical properties of amorphous solids is crucial for material design, with microalloying being a common but not well-understood method. Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect of impurity particles on the yielding transition of amorphous solids in the context of brittle-ductile transition with microalloying. Spherical impurities larger than the constitutive particles enhance the systems mechanical stability, leading to a higher yield strain and increased brittleness. Much more potent effects are observed for rod-shaped impurities of the same size as the spherical impurities, with an aspect ratio slightly larger than one, which primarily introduce rotational degrees of freedom into the system. However, as the aspect ratio increases, their rotational degrees of freedom decrease, causing a more brittle yielding with more localized shear band formation. It is remarkable to see how freezing the rotational degrees of freedom can create extremely brittle, yet remarkably stable amorphous solids. Enhancing brittleness through higher concentrations of aspherical impurities presents an intriguing opportunity to explore the ductile-to-brittle transition, which is easily accessible in experiments, particularly in colloidal experiments. Our thorough finite-size scaling analysis has revealed a compelling suggestion of a finite-disorder critical point: a boundary between ductile and brittle behaviors.

Abstract: Superconductivity is identified by the emergence of a macroscopic zero-resistance state, typically inferred from a vanishing four-probe voltage at finite current. That inference assumes spatially uniform conduction-e.g., at least one continuous superconducting path between the current leads and voltage electrodes that sample a finite potential gradient-and can fail if the drive current bypasses the electrodes or if narrow filaments short the current contacts. Here we introduce a methodology to test these assumptions in superconductors, by using spatially resolved measurements of local variations in dc using cryogenic conductive atomic-force microscopy (cAFM). Using Fe(Se,Te) as a model system, we find that despite bulk measurements consistent with a homogeneous superconducting state, the material exhibits a heterogeneous conducting landscape: micrometre-scale superconducting regions coexist with relatively insulating areas. We further show that cAFM resolves conductance fluctuations at 20 K (> TC) that vary between repeated scans, consistent with expectations for short-lived, pre-formed Cooper pairs in the BCS-BEC crossover regime. These results establish cAFM as a practical tool to validate assumptions underlying four-probe transport and underscore the need for direct spatial probes in materials whose macroscopic response can conceal nanoscale inhomogeneity. Accurate identification of macroscopic properties is critical for materials classes like superconductors that are defined by their macroscopic properties.

Abstract: The size and morphology of defect clusters formed during primary damage play a crucial role in the subsequent microstructural evolution of irradiated materials. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of collision cascades in tungsten (W) were performed using five interatomic potentials (IAPs): the quantum-accurate machine-learned Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (W-SNAP), the machine learning-based tabGAP potential, and three embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials. A total of 3,500 MD simulations were conducted with primary knock-on atoms (PKAs) at energies of 5, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, and 150 keV. PKAs were launched in 100 random directions at each energy to ensure statistical validity. Analysis was performed using CSaransh , a web-based tool for large-scale collision cascade databases, to quantify: (i) the number of defects (isolated and clustered), (ii) defect cluster morphologies, (iii) defect cluster size distributions and (iv) the number of sub-cascades formed. We show that the difference in the formation energy of self interstitial atom dumbells along the <1 1 0> and <1 1 1> directions critically influence defect cluster morphology. Our results indicate that IAP stiffness and interaction range independently do not affect defect count. However, these parameters combined with defect formation energies, threshold displacement energies, and other factors significantly influence defect production.

Abstract: Equilibrium self-assembly and conventional materials processing techniques fall far short of mimicking dynamic self-actuating processes that are commonplace throughout biology. To bridge the gap between living and synthetic matter, we study adhesive non-thermal fibers immersed in an active fluid. Autonomous chaotic flows power non-equilibrium fiber dynamics, inducing their collisions, generating connections, and weaving a membrane-shaped elastic network. This active assembly generates a hierarchy of shapes, structures, and dynamical processes spanning nanometers to centimeters. Ultimately, it generates an active membrane that exhibits global limit cycles induced by a non-reciprocal coupling between the elastic membrane deformations and the alignment axis of the polar active fluid. Our work merges self-assembly with active matter, demonstrating self-processing materials wherein hierarchical life-like structures and dynamics emerge from an initially structureless suspension.

Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, often lead to breakthroughs in the our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or equivalently by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.

Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the formation and decay kinetics of vortices in two dimensional, compressible quantum turbulence. We follow the temporal evolution of a quantum fluid of exciton polaritons, hybrid light matter quasiparticles, and measure both phase and modulus of the order parameter in the turbulent regime. Fundamental topological conservation laws require that the formation and annihilation of vortices also involve critical points of the velocity field, namely nodes and saddles. Identifying the simplest mechanisms underlying these processes enables us to develop an effective kinetic model that closely aligns with the experimental observations, and shows that different processes are responsible for vortex number growth and decay. These findings underscore the crucial role played by topological constraints in shaping nonlinear, turbulent evolution of two dimensional quantum fluids.

Abstract: The fate of the Fermi surface in bulk electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ remains elusive, as does the origin and extension of its pseudogap phase. Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$IrO$_{4}$ up to $x=0.2$, a factor of two higher than in previous work. We find that the antinodal pseudogap persists up to the highest doping level, and thus beyond the sharp increase in Hall carrier density to $\simeq 1+x$ recently observed above $x^{*}\simeq 0.16$ [Y.-T. Hsu et al., Nature Physics 20, 1593 (2024)]. This suggests that doped iridates host a unique phase of matter in which a large Hall density coexists with an anisotropic pseudogap, breaking up the Fermi surface into disconnected arcs. The temperature boundary of the pseudogap is $T^{*}\simeq 200$ K for $x=0.2$, comparable to cuprates and to the energy scale of short range antiferromagnetic correlations in cuprates and iridates.

Abstract: We study integrability breaking and transport in a discrete space-time lattice with a local integrability breaking perturbation. We find a singular distribution of the Lyapunov spectrum where the majority of Lyapunov exponents vanish in the thermodynamic limit. The sub-extensive sequence of nonzero exponents, converging in the thermodynamic limit, correspond to Lyapunov vectors that are exponentially localized with localization lengths proportional to inverse Lyapunov exponents. Moreover, we investigate the transport behavior of the system by considering the spin-spin and current-current spatio-temporal correlation functions. Our results indicate that the overall transport behavior, similarly as in the purely integrable case, conforms to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling in the thermodynamic limit and at vanishing magnetization. The same dynamical exponent $z=3/2$ governs the effect of local perturbation spreading in the bulk.

Abstract: Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.

Abstract: Unlike broken time-reversal symmetric (TRS) systems with a defined Chern number, directly measuring the bulk $Z_{2}$ invariant and Berry curvature (if nonzero) in topological insulators and their higher-order topological families remains an unsolved problem. Here, based on the refined trace-determinant inequality (TDI) involving the trace and determinant of the quantum metric and maximal Berry curvature (MBC), we establish an optical bound on the MBC for two-dimensional TRS insulators. By utilizing experimental data on linearly polarized optical conductivity within a certain energy range, the topological signatures can be identified by integrating the optical bound. We illustrate our approach using three representative topological models: the Kane-Mele model, mirror-protected insulator, and quadrupole insulator. We find that the resulting momentum integration of the refined TDI provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum volume (QV) variations and topological phase transitions. We argue that double QV can be treated as an upper bound on the number of boundary states. Our findings offer a method for extracting the topological signatures of TRS insulators using optical conductivity data.

Abstract: Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising advanced nuclear fuel due to its high thermal conductivity and high fissile density. Yet, many aspects of its mechanical behavior and microstructural features are currently unknown. In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study UN's diffusional creep. Nanometer-sized polycrystals are used to simulate diffusional creep and to calculate an effective GB width. It is found that Nabarro-Herring creep is not dominant in the temperature range of 1700$-$2000 K and that the dominant diffusional creep mechanism is Coble creep with an activation energy of 2.28 $\pm$ 0.09 eV. A method is proposed to calculate the diffusional GB width and its temperature dependence in polycrystals. The effective GB width of UN is calculated as 2.69 $\pm$ 0.08 nm. This value fits very well with the prefactor of the phenomenological Coble creep formula. It is demonstrated that the most comprehensive thermal creep model for UN can be represented as the combination of our Coble creep model and the dislocation creep model proposed by Hayes et al.

Abstract: The evolution of the role of lattice vibrations in the formation of the pseudogap state in strongly correlated electron systems has been investigated concerning changes in the electron-phonon coupling parameters and the concentration of doped charge carriers. We apply the polaronic version of the generalized tight-binding method to analyze the band structure of a realistic multiband two-dimensional model that incorporates the electron-lattice contributions of both Holstein and Peierls types. It has been demonstrated that the emergence of polaronic effects begins with the modulation of spectral function intensity. However, within a specific region of the phase diagram, a significant transformation of the electron band structure and pseudogap state occurs. It results from coherent polaron excitations that create a partially flat band near the Fermi level. This process leads to a change in the topology of the Fermi surface and the emergence of corresponding features in the density of states.

Abstract: Due to their photonic components, exciton-polariton systems provide a convenient platform to study the coherence properties of weakly-interacting Bose gases. In particular, optical interferometry enables the measurement of the first-order coherence function which provides information about the intrinsic correlations of the system. In this paper, we derive a universal curve for the coherent fraction of a noninteracting, equilibrium, homogeneous, two-dimensional Bose gas, with density expressed in units of the observation area, and compare to recent experimental results. Although there is a sharp transition from normal to superfluid phases in the thermodynamic limit, the coherent fraction of the gas varies continuously across this transition due to the finite system size. We find that the theory agrees nearly perfectly with the experimental data in the low-density limit with no free parameters other than the effective temperature, highly constrained by the measurements. At higher density, the experiments are consistent with standard weakly-interacting Bose gas theory. By having a theory that treats both the optical diffraction and Bose coherence, we can clearly see the effect of the quantum statistics on the coherence.

Abstract: The synthesis of metallic nanoparticle assemblies is nowadays well-controlled, such that these systems offer the possibility of controlling light at a sub-wavelength scale, thanks, for instance, to surface plasmons. Determining the energy dispersion of plasmons likely to couple to light within these nanostructures is, therefore, a necessary preliminary task on the way to understanding both their photonic properties and their physical nature, namely the role of the quadrupole contribution. Starting with a general model that takes account of all energy modes, we show that its low-lying energy dispersion gained numerically, can be compared to that of a minimal model that treats dipoles and quadrupoles on the same footing. The main advantage of the latter relies on the fact that its formulation is tractable, such that a semi-analytical Bogoliubov transformation allows one to access the experimentally relevant energy bands. Based on this semi-analytical derivation, we determine quantitatively the limit of validity of the dipole-only model, the presently proposed dipole and quadrupole model, compared to a full-plasmon-mode Hamiltonian. The results show that the dispersion relation, which includes dipoles and quadrupoles, is sufficient to capture the low-energy physics at play in most experimental situations. Besides, we show that at small lattice spacing, the contribution of quadrupoles is dominant around the Brillouin zone center.

Abstract: Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.

Abstract: The relationship between surfaces of constant charge density and triply-periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) has been the subject of considerable speculation over many years. Zero-potential surfaces generated by an electrostatic field from a distribution of point charges corresponding to a crystal provide an approximate description of the TPMS for the structure of that crystal. We have recently provided a first-principles alternative to such phenomenological comparisons based on the Vienna {\it ab initio} simulation package (VASP). We showed that the surfaces of zero charge density calculated for the crystal structure of a material converges to the TPMS of the corresponding crystalline material. The exchange-correlation potentials are chosen for the particular material based on the benchmarking of various approximations for these potentials carried out by others. Here, we report an extension of our previous work by giving additional examples of our theory that shows the zero electron density of an equilibrium structure corresponds to a TPMS for a variety of materials and crystalline structures. We study the ground states of elemental materials that differ electronically and structurally, Na, Cu, Al, Zr, and a compound, NiTi, as well as different phases of the elemental solids that are observed by varying the different thermodynamic conditions.

Abstract: The numerical integration of stochastic growth equations on non-Euclidean networks presents unique challenges due to the nonlinearities that occur in many relevant models and of the structural constraints of the networks. In this work, we integrate the KPZ, Edwards-Wilkinson, and tensionless KPZ equations on Cayley trees using different numerical schemes and compare their behavior with previous results obtained for discrete growth models. By assessing the stability and accuracy of these methods, we explore how network topology influences interface growth and how boundary effects shape the observed scaling properties. Our results show good agreement with previous studies on discrete models, reinforcing key scaling behaviors while highlighting some differences. These findings contribute to a better understanding of surface growth on networked substrates and provide a computational framework for studying nonlinear stochastic processes beyond Euclidean lattices.

Abstract: We reveal a hidden electrodynamical structure emerging from a general $2\times2$ pseudo-Hermitian system that exhibits real spectra. Even when the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time, the Berry curvature can be mapped onto a $2+1$ dimensional electromagnetic field arising from an artificial spacetime instanton, in sharp contrast to the Hermitian systems where the Berry curvature is equivalent to the static magnetic field of a magnetic monopole in three spatial dimensions. The instanton appearing as a spacetime singularity carries a topological charge that quantizes the jump of magnetic flux of the Berry curvature at the time origin. Our findings are demonstrated in a simple example related to antiferromagnetic magnons.

Abstract: A laser-ultrasonic approach was used to measure elastic properties of a superelastic nickel-titanium wire with the aim to evaluate their evolution with stress and temperature in stress-induced martensite. It was observed that this evolution can be well described by a single smooth surface in the stress-temperature space, with the values of Young's modulus ranging from 30 to 50 GPa. The evolution of the modulus was then monitored in-situ with further heating under fixed strain, that is, during the shape setting. The results revealed that the martensite phase experienced further softening during this process, reaching Young's modulus of nearly 10 GPa at high temperatures and high stresses. In addition, the measurement enabled a direct detection of the initiation and termination temperatures of the shape setting from the elasticity data, which was used to show that it occurs in the same temperature interval for tension-induced and torsion-induced martensite.

Abstract: The manipulation of material properties by laser light holds great promise for the development of future technologies. However, the full picture of the electronic response to laser driving remains to be uncovered. We present a novel approach to reveal details of the electron dynamics of laser-dressed materials, which consists of calculating and analysing the time-dependent partial density of states (PDOS) of materials during their interaction with a driving electromagnetic field. We show that the laser-dressed PDOS provides information about the structure of the bonds that form the laser-dressed electron density, analogous to the information that a PDOS can provide about the electron structure in a field-free case. We illustrate how our method can provide insights into the electron dynamics of materials in a site- and orbital-selective manner with calculations for a laser-dressed wurtzite ZnO crystal. Our work provides an analytical tool for the interpretation of subcycle-resolved experiments on laser-dressed materials and for the development of strategies for optical manipulation of material properties.

Abstract: An analytical model is developed to predict the temporal evolution of the lattice polarization in ferroelectric nanomembranes upon the excitation by a terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulse of an arbitrary waveform, and the concurrent transmission of the THz pulse in both the linear and the nonlinear regimes. It involves the use of the perturbation method to solve the equation of motion for the lattice polarization in both unclamped and strained ferroelectric nanomembranes within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory. The model is applicable to perovskite oxides such as BaTiO3 and SrTiO3, wurtzite Al1-xScxN, and trigonal LiNbO3. Our analytical model provides a theoretical basis for determining the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of ferroelectric materials through THz transmission experiment. The calculation results also suggest an approach to reversing the chirality of a circularly polarized THz pulse by harnessing the resonant polarization-photon coupling in ferroelectrics. This capability of chirality reversal, along with the high tunability from a strain applied along any arbitrarily oriented in-plane axis, provides new opportunities for THz wave modulation without relying on complex metasurface designs.

Abstract: We propose a general necessary condition for a spin chain with SO(3) spin-rotation symmetry to be gapped. Specifically, we prove that the ground state(s) of an SO(3)-symmetric gapped spin chain must be spin singlet(s), and the expectation value of a twisting operator asymptotically approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit, where finite-size corrections are inversely proportional to the system size. This theorem provides (i) supporting evidence for various conjectured gapped phases, and (ii) a sufficient criterion for identifying gapless spin chains. We verify our theorem by numerical simulations for a variety of spin models and show that it offers a novel efficient way to identify gapless phases in spin chains with spin-rotation symmetry.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have drawn significant interest owing to their impressive physical and chemical characteristics. Following graphene's isolation, a wide range of 2D carbon materials has been suggested, each with distinct electronic, mechanical, and optical traits. Rational design and synthesis of new 2D carbon structures hinge on experimentally reported precursors. Here, we present a 2D carbon allotrope, propylenidene (PPD), originating from bicyclopropylidene. PPD forms a rectangular lattice with 3, 8, and 10-membered carbon rings. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations investigate its structural, electronic, mechanical, and optical properties. Our study shows PPD to be metallic. PPD exhibits absorption in the infrared and visible range, showing directional dependence in its response. Mechanically, PPD exhibits marked anisotropy; Young's modulus ($Y$) varies between 205.83 N/m and 164.46 N/m. These findings underscore the potential of this novel monolayer in applications such as energy storage, gas sensing, and optoelectronics.

Abstract: Reducing the dimensionality of metal-halide perovskites enhances quantum and dielectric confinement, enabling tunable excitonic properties. In one dimension, the arrangement of metal-halide octahedra in chains with corner-, edge-, or face-sharing connectivity allows for additional structural flexibility. This not only expands material design possibilities but also reflects quasi-one-dimensional motifs that arise during perovskite formation but are poorly understood. Using first-principles many-body perturbation theory within the $GW$ and Bethe-Salpeter Equation framework, we provide a comprehensive picture of how one-dimensional confinement, octahedral connectivity and dielectric screening affect optical absorption and exciton photophysics in these materials. Our calculations reveal that increasing octahedral connectivity leads to increased exciton binding and complex, anisotropic optical signatures. However, in experimentally synthesized organic-inorganic systems, pronounced dielectric screening effects can reduce exciton binding energies by several hundred meV, altering these trends. These findings offer insights and design principles for excitonic properties, and aid the interpretation of optical experiments on one-dimensional perovskites.

Abstract: This paper presents a Landau treatment of the incommensurate density wave transition observed in trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates and uses this to address the nature of the transition. The data are consistent with a spin driven transition with the distinct intertwining of charge and spin order due to being in or proximate to the first order transition region of the Landau phase diagram. From this approach, one also obtains an understanding of the variation of the transition temperature with rare earth size, pressure, and oxygen isotope substitution.

Abstract: This study investigates the influence of chirality, viscous effects, and confinement geometry on the flow dynamics and defect structures of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) using numerical simulations. As chiral strength increases, $\pi$-twist defects form at low chirality and progressively organize into hexagonal domains resembling blue phase--like (BP-like) structures at higher chirality. At sufficiently high chirality and aspect ratios, skyrmion-like configurations emerge, indicating the formation of dynamic analogs of equilibrium phases under flow. Sudden contraction geometries reveal how aspect ratio and elastic interactions promote flow disturbances and defect development. Analyses of velocity and scalar order parameter ($S$) distributions demonstrate strong coupling between molecular alignment and hydrodynamic fields, with localized vortices forming around $\tau^-$ defects in regions of low $S$ and velocity. Temporal evaluations of velocity fluctuations uncover chaotic flow regimes at low Ericksen numbers, characterized by irregular defect motion and skewed probability density functions. These findings offer new insights into CLC structure formation and flow behavior, with potential applications in defect engineering, microfluidics, soft robotics, and photonic materials.

Abstract: BaCd2P2 (BCP) has recently been identified as a new solar absorber with promising optoelectronic properties. Here, we demonstrate the defect tolerance in BCP by comparing its optoelectronic properties with that of the well-studied absorber GaAs. Despite having a low precursor purity, our synthesized BCP samples exhibit a bright band-to-band room-temperature photoluminescence with relatively low surface recombination losses, a high implied open-circuit voltage, and a carrier lifetime of ~300 ns, all comparable to or better than those of a high-purity single-crystalline GaAs wafer. In contrast, GaAs samples synthesized using similar methods as BCP show no band-to-band photoluminescence emissions. To better probe the bulk properties and understand the high optoelectronic performance of BCP, we perform first-principles defect calculations and show that BCP has a much lower Shockley-Read-Hall nonradiative recombination rate from antisite defects compared to GaAs. Our results reveal that BCP is robust to impurities introduced during synthesis and defect-mediated nonradiative recombination, demonstrating its high photovoltaic potential.

Abstract: We present a hardware realization and measurements of a tetron qubit device in a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure. The device architecture contains two parallel superconducting nanowires, which support four Majorana zero modes (MZMs) when tuned into the topological phase, and a trivial superconducting backbone. Two distinct readout interferometers are formed by connecting the superconducting structure to a series of quantum dots. We perform single-shot interferometric measurements of the fermion parity for the two loops, designed to implement Pauli-$X$ and $Z$ measurements of the tetron. Performing repeated single-shot measurements yields two widely separated time scales $\tau_X = 14.5\pm 0.3 \, \mathrm{\mu s}$ and $\tau_Z = 12.4\pm 0.4\, \mathrm{ms}$ for parity switches observed in the $X$ and $Z$ measurement loops, which we attribute to intra-wire parity switches and external quasiparticle poisoning, respectively. We estimate assignment errors of $\mathrm{err}^X_a=16\%$ and $\mathrm{err}^Z_a=0.5\%$ for $X$ and $Z$ measurement-based operations, respectively.

Abstract: $\mathrm{Mn_3Sn}(0\overline{1}\overline{1}0)[0001]$ experiences a tensile strain when grown epitaxially on $\mathrm{MgO}(110)[001]$, and thus the energy landscape changes from six-fold symmetry to two-fold symmetry. External magnetic field further breaks the symmetry and the resulting energy landscape is sensitive to the field orientation relative to the easy axis. In the presence of thermal noise, the relaxation of the magnetic octupole moment in a strained Mn$_3$Sn film is composed of four distinct escape processes involving the two saddle points and two equilibrium states in the energy landscape. Here, we apply harmonic transition-state theory to derive analytical expressions for the inter-well escape time and octupole moment relaxation time, both influenced by an external symmetry-breaking magnetic field and finite thermal noise in the intermediate-to-high damping regime. The analytical predictions are in strong agreement with comprehensive numerical simulations based on coupled LLG equations. The results presented here are crucial toward realizing Mn$_3$Sn's applications in random number generation and probabilistic computing.

Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.

Abstract: The coupling between real-space inhomogeneities coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states -- energetically isolated within the bulk band gap -- emerge and exhibit both N\'eel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin $\boldsymbol{r}$-$\boldsymbol{s}$ coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr$_2$Se$_2$O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the N\'eel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.

Abstract: Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation. Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding statistics of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological origin in the classification of non-Abelian Berry phases in braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle number conservation and particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with the aid of a controlled local defect. In this example, the zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our theoretical predictions. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics, paving the way for experimental validation of our predictions and their application in quantum information science.

Abstract: We propose an efficient computational methodology for predicting the synthesizability of high entropy oxides (HEOs) in a large space of possible candidate compounds. HEOs are a growing field with an enormous potential chemical composition space, and yet the discovery of new HEOs is slow and driven by experimental trial-and-error. In this work, we attempt to speed up this process by using a machine learned interatomic potential offering DFT-level accuracy. Our methodology starts by identifying a set of crystal structures and elements for screening, building a large random unit cell of each composition and structure, then relaxing this structure. The most promising candidates are distinguished based on the variance of the individual cation energies, which we introduce as our entropy descriptor, and the enthalpy of mixing, which is used as the enthalpy descriptor. The approach is applied to tetravalent HEOs, and its validity is confirmed by comparison to alternative descriptors and DFT calculations for a set of 7 elements. The search is then extended to a set of 14 elements and three crystal structures, where it successfully identifies the only known stable 4-component HEO in the $\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, as well as predicting several new 5-component candidate systems. This approach can straightforwardly be applied to new sets of elements and structures, allowing for the accelerated discovery of new HEOs.

Abstract: We investigate the low-energy configurations of N mutually repelling charges confined to a spherical cap and interacting via the Coulomb potential. In the continuum limit, this problem was solved by Lord Kelvin, who found a non-uniform charge distribution with an integrable singularity at the boundary. To explore the discrete analogue, we developed an efficient numerical method that enables energy minimization while maintaining the number of charges at the cap's edge fixed. Using this approach we have obtained numerical results for various values of N and cap angular widths. Based on these results, we analyze the emergence and behavior of topological defects as functions of both N and the cap's curvature.

Abstract: The determination of the critical current density from magnetic hysteresis loops is widely used to characterize and compare superconducting samples. Magnetic hysteresis loops for tapes and single crystals depend on both the critical current density and sample size. The latter sets the scale of supercurrent circulation. However, in polycrystalline high-temperature superconductors prepared by solid-phase synthesis or by sol-gel method, the magnetization is determined by the circulation of supercurrents in individual grains. The paper discusses the effect of the grain size distribution on the effective scale of current circulation. Log-normal and Weibull distributions are both considered as possible for grain sizes. The effective size for calculating the intragrain current density has been shown to be significantly larger than the average grain size.

Abstract: Living systems often function with regulatory interactions, but the question of how activity, stochasticity and regulations work together for achieving different goals still remains puzzling. We propose the model of an active tracking particle with information processing, based on which the entropy production, information flow, and generalised fluctuation theorem are derived. Moreover, the system performance, in terms of the first passage steps and the total energy consumption, are analysed in the variable space of (measurement error, control field), leading to discussions on the optimal control of the system. Not only elucidating the basic concepts involved in a stochastic active system with information processing, this prototypical model could also inspire more elaborated modelings of natural smart organisms and industrial designs of controllable active systems with desired physical performances in the future.

Abstract: Silica fume is a valuable by-product from the silicon and ferrosilicon production. It is therefore important to understand the impact on the silica fume quality when converting the furnace feed from fossil-based to renewable reduction materials. Using self-consistent numerical simulations of the nucleation and condensation process, we present a detailed study of the silica fume formation process.
  It is found that the most critical physical effect that determines the final particle size distribution is coalescence due to Brownian motion. Furthermore, it is crucial to use appropriate thermophysical parameters in order to reproduce reliable particle size distributions. Contrary to what has been done in previous studies on the same topic, this is now done by using reasonable expressions for surface energy, saturation pressure and the nucleation pre-exponential factor.
  It is also found that under conditions relevant to furnaces, the liberation of latent heat leads to an explosive chain reaction of particle nucleation and condensation when the first particles nucleate and start growing due to condensation. This process continues until the relative saturation pressure of silicon dioxide is reduced to unity.
  Finally, it is found that the Lagrangian approach for particle tracking is more flexible and accurate, and also more CPU efficient, than the Eulerian approach.

Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays with Van der Waals interactions provide a controllable path to simulate the locally connected transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), a prototypical model in statistical mechanics. Remotely operating the publicly accessible Aquila Rydberg atom array, we experimentally investigate the physics of TFIM far from equilibrium and uncover significant deviations from the theoretical predictions. Rather than the expected ballistic spread of correlations, the Rydberg simulator exhibits a subballistic spread, along with a logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy in time - all while the system mostly retains its initial magnetization. By modeling the atom motion, we trace these effects to an emergent disorder in Rydberg atom arrays, which we characterize with a minimal random spin model. We further experimentally explore the different dynamical regimes hosted in the system by varying the lattice spacing and the Rabi frequency. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atom motion in the many-body dynamics of Rydberg atom arrays at the TFIM limit, and propose simple benchmark measurements to test for its presence in future experiments.

Abstract: Majorana fermions and their generalizations to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ parafermions are considered promising building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers for their ability to encode quantum information nonlocally. In such topological quantum computers, highly robust quantum gates are obtained by braiding pairs of these quasi-particles. However, it is well-known that braiding Majorana fermions or parafermions only leads to a Clifford gate, hindering quantum universality. This paper establishes an exact mapping between Majorana fermions to $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions in systems under total parity non-conserving and total parity conserving setting. It is revealed that braiding of Majorana fermions may lead to non-Clifford quantum gates in the 4-dimensional qudit representation spanned by $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions, whilst braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions may similarly yield non-Clifford quantum gates in the qubit representation spanned by Majorana fermions. This finding suggests that topologically protected universal quantum computing may be possible with Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) by supplementing the usual braiding operations with the braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions (Majorana fermions) that could be formed out of Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) via the mapping prescribed here. Finally, the paper discusses how braiding of Majorana fermions or $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions could be obtained via a series of parity measurements.

Abstract: Random exchanges of energy arise naturally in stochastic systems. As a consequence, apparent violations of the second law of thermodynamics can occur, as it holds true on average. Here we investigate the occurrence of these apparent violations -- termed free lunches -- in a quantum-classical system comprised of levitated nanoparticles exchanging energy via the Coulomb interaction. We consider different initial states for the quantum system, and how these exert work and fluctuations upon the classical particle affecting the probability of free lunches. With that, we initiate the study of hybrid quantum-classical systems through the lens of stochastic thermodynamics.

arXiv:2505.09973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the coherent-incoherent correspondence as a framework for deriving quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations under continuous measurement in Lindblad dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence establishes a mapping between the original quantum system that undergoes \textit{ coherent} evolution and its corresponding \textit{incoherent} system without coherent dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence relates quantities across these two systems, including jump statistics, dynamical activity, and entropy production. Since the classical-like properties of the incoherent system allow us to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations within it, these relations can be transferred to the coherent system via the coherent-incoherent correspondence. This enables us to derive quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations for the original coherent system. Unlike existing quantum uncertainty relations, which typically require explicit quantum correction terms, our approach avoids these additional terms. This means that we can establish a lower bound for quantum entropy production using only current statistics. This approach opens up new possibilities for inferring entropy production in quantum systems. Through numerical calculations for a model with coherent jump operators, we show that steady-state coherence lowers the bounds on precision (i.e., allows higher precision).

arXiv:2505.15752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative and nonradiative resonant couplings between defects are ubiquitous phenomena in photonic devices used in classical and quantum information technology applications. In this work we present a first principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipole like emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin flip and spin conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO at ~10nm distances from a dipolar source, using rather moderate cavity with quality factor Q~400. We also show that a similar suppression in the transfer rate can be achieved by off-tuning the cavity resonance relative to the emitter transition energy. The framework presented here is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.

arXiv:2507.04558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The XY spin chain is a paradigmatic example of a model solved by free fermions, in which the energy eigenspectrum is built from combinations of quasi-energies. In this article we show that by extending the XY model's anisotropy parameter $\lambda$ to complex values, it is possible for two of the quasi-energies to become degenerate. In the non-Hermitian XY model these quasi-energy degeneracies give rise to exceptional points (EPs) where two of the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. The distinct $\lambda$ values at which EPs appear form concentric rings in the complex plane which are shown in the infinite system size limit to converge to the unit circle coinciding with the boundary between distinct topological phases. The non-Hermitian model is also seen to possess a line of broken $PT$ symmetry along the pure imaginary $\lambda$-axis. For finite systems, there are four EP values on this broken $PT$-symmetric line if the system size is a multiple of 4.

It is emphasized that the in depth analysis of Brambilla et.al. goes well beyond our brief treatment.

Abstract: Hybrid integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials with nanophotonic platforms has enabled compact optoelectronic devices by leveraging the unique optical and electronic properties of atomically thin layers. While most efforts have focused on coupling 2D materials to pre-defined photonic structures, the broader potential of 2D heterostructures for actively engineering the photonic environment remains largely unexplored. In our previous work, we employed single types of 2D material and showed that even monolayer flakes can locally induce high-$Q$ nanocavities in photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides through effective refractive index modulation. Here, we extend this concept by demonstrating that further transferring of 2D material flakes onto the induced hybrid nanocavity to form heterostructures enable more flexibility for post-fabrication dielectric environment engineering of the cavity. We show that the high-$Q$ hybrid nanocavities remain robust under sequential flake stacking. Coupling optically active MoTe$_{2}$ flake to these cavities yields enhanced photoluminescence and reduced emission lifetimes, consistent with Purcell-enhanced light-matter interactions. Additionally, encapsulation with a top hBN layer leads to a significant increase in the cavity $Q$ factor, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our results show that these heterostructure stacks not only preserve the cavity quality but also introduce an additional degrees of control -- via flake thickness, refractive indices, size and interface design -- offering a richer dielectric environment modulation landscape than what is achievable with monolayers alone, providing a versatile method toward scalable and reconfigurable hybrid nanophotonic systems.

Abstract: We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0<\gamma<\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.

Abstract: We study scattering in the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.

Abstract: The random current representation of the Ising model, along with a related path expansion, has been a source of insight on the stochastic geometric underpinning of the ferromagnetic model's phase structure and critical behavior in different dimensions. This representation is extended in this work to systems with a mild amount of frustration, such as generated by disorder operators and external field of mixed signs. Further examples of the utility of stochastic geometric representations are presented here in the context of the deconfinement transition of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge model -- particularly in three dimensions -- and in streamlined proofs of correlation inequalities with wide-ranging applications.
