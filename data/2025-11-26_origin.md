Abstract: We present a fast spectral solver for the linear response of viscoelastic structures under oscillatory flow either in free space or close to a flat moving wall. The scheme works in the frequency domain (using phasors) and couples the oscillatory Stokes equation with rigid or flexible structures, modeled by viscoelastic networks of immersed boundary kernels. The fluid-structure coupling can be solved by two routes. One route calculates the hydrodynamic mobility matrix required to solve the equation for the structure deformation rate in matrix form. The second route iteratively solves the coupled fluid-structure equations: fluid-induced forces on the structures create a tension field which is then transferred to the fluid, until convergence. The resulting fixed-point problem is solved iteratively using the Anderson acceleration method. The mobility route is optimal when dealing with one or few structures, while the iterative scheme is preferred for denser dispersions. In any case, the flow resulting from the body forces is solved by a recently developed scheme [J. Fluid. Mech. 1010 A57, 2025] which is spectral in space and time and deals with doubly periodic open domains (either free-space or wall-bounded) where meshing is restricted to the region of interest around the structures. We test the present scheme in two applied contexts: quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM) of spheres, suspended, adsorbed or tethered to viscoelastic linkers; and force spectroscopy (via atomic force microscopy) reproducing the power spectra of vibrating microparticles near a solid boundary. In all cases, comparisons with analytical, numerical and experimental results show excellent agreement. We conclude by discussing new routes the scheme opens in force spectroscopy and QCM analyses of soft objects.

Abstract: In this research paper, we present an exact matrix form analytical solution of the multi-dimensional generalized Langevin equation with quadratic potentials. Our investigation provides detailed expressions for the two-dimensional probability distribution and extends the understanding of the dynamics governed by harmonic potentials. By utilizing the inverse Laplace transformation, we offer a precise method to solve these equations, corroborated by specific examples. This study contributes to the fundamental understanding of stochastic processes in multi-dimensional systems with harmonic potentials and clarifies the limitations of our approach. While the findings are specific to quadratic potentials, they provide a robust framework for exploring related phenomena within this context.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials offer a promising path toward sustainable energy generation, but their development is limited by the difficulty of identifying high performance donor and acceptor pairs with strong power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Existing design strategies typically focus on either the donor or the acceptor alone, rather than using a unified approach capable of modeling both components. In this work, we introduce a dual machine learning framework for OPV discovery that combines predictive modeling with generative molecular design. We present the Organic Photovoltaic Donor Acceptor Dataset (OPV2D), the largest curated dataset of its kind, containing 2000 experimentally characterized donor acceptor pairs. Using this dataset, we develop the Organic Photovoltaic Classifier (OPVC) to predict whether a material exhibits OPV behavior, and a hierarchical graph neural network that incorporates multi task learning and donor acceptor interaction modeling. This framework includes the Molecular Orbital Energy Estimator (MOE2) for predicting HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and the Photovoltaic Performance Predictor (P3) for estimating PCE. In addition, we introduce the Material Generative Pretrained Transformer (MatGPT) to produce synthetically accessible organic semiconductors, guided by a reinforcement learning strategy with three objective policy optimization. By linking molecular representation learning with performance prediction, our framework advances data driven discovery of high performance OPV materials.

arXiv:2511.19530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two cross-linked polymer systems in the strong stretching regime. The first consists of two polymers sharing one endpoint, with the other two endpoints coupled by a harmonic potential. Within the weakly bending approximation, we analyze the tensile elastic response for freely jointed or wormlike chains; for the latter, the approximation applies either at large tension or at moderate tension with large persistence length (rodlike limit). We obtain analytic expressions for the force--extension relation and for the longitudinal and transverse mismatch of the cross-linked endpoints. In the thermodynamic limit, the cross-link does not affect the tensile elasticity, but it significantly suppresses transverse fluctuations, effectively forming a loop structure. The second system is a polymer necklace in the thermodynamic limit, composed of two strongly stretched polymers interconnected by a regular sequence of reversible cross-links. Using an analogy with a two-dimensional system of concatenated Gaussian loops ("Gaussian slinky"), we calculate the mean fraction of cross-linked sites as a function of the tensile force and find weak and strong binding regimes connected by a crossover. For shallow binding potential wells (compared with $k_{\rm{B}}T$), we employ a continuum description and exploit the mapping between directed polymers and a two-dimensional quantum particle to determine the crossover behavior and the mean transverse separation between the two polymer chains.

arXiv:2511.19567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at filling 5/2, which is usually understood as a $p$-wave paired state of underlying quasiparticles - composite fermions, transforms into a nematic phase under pressure \cite{csathy0, csathy}. A pair density wave (PDW) may be a precursor, underlying state for this behaviour, and such state(s) were proposed that maintain the weak-pairing feature of the uniform paired state \cite{frad}. Based on considerations in the weak-coupling regime of a microscopic description of the pairing phase (to mimic the phase as it gives way to a nematic phase in the experiments), we argue that the ensuing and relevant PDW state has a strong-pairing character. Furthermore, due to the existence of a single collective mode associated with the order parameter in the uniform paired phase, in the weak-coupling regime, the $p$-wave paired state, in general (for example, in the superconducting state of electrons), may be prone to a PDW instability.

Abstract: We present a controlled mechanical exfoliation technique for bulk 3D topological insulators that yields atomically clean ultrathin flakes, enabling quantum well states (QWS) of Dirac electrons to be clearly resolved. Achieving reliable fabrication of pristine, high-quality two-dimensional layers suitable for atomic-scale spectroscopy remains a central experimental challenge in uncovering their emergent quantum states and realizing device-relevant functionalities. Atomically resolved scanning probe microscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy reveal a strong correlation between Raman intensity and film thickness, enabling rapid identification of (Bi\textsubscript{0.1}Sb\textsubscript{0.9})\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{3} flakes with desired thickness. High resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy on exfoliated flakes with atomically flat terraces reveals QWS, driven by quantum confinement of Dirac electrons. This effect is rarely observed due to the electrons resistance to electrostatic confinement caused by Klein tunneling. The standard phase accumulation model accurately captures the characteristics of QWS and extracts the electronic band dispersion, showing excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations. Band structure calculation reveals that with increasing quantum-layer thickness, the interlayer coupling enhances the electronic dispersion, progressively reducing subband splitting and giving rise to bulk-like continuous bands. Spatially resolved spectroscopy around surface defects further confirms that QWS of Dirac electrons in topological insulators remains robust against defect scattering. This work paves the way for exploring diverse quantum phenomena and device applications through quantum confinement, surface-state engineering, and tunable topological phases.

Abstract: Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved. In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further indicates a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.

Abstract: In a significant conceptual revision to the tenfold classification scheme for topological insulators and superconductors, it was recently demonstrated that most three-dimensional (3D) classes are simultaneously "localizable" in two distinct, but intricately connected ways: (1) There is no obstruction to Wannier localization of all bulk eigenstates, and (2) Almost all surface states can be Anderson localized by arbitrarily weak symmetry-preserving quenched disorder. Here we consider the localizable class CI in 3D, and numerically investigate the stability of surface states. We demonstrate that surface states of a bulk class-CI topological lattice model are fragile in that they can be Anderson localized by the combination of weak quenched randomness and hybridization with an additional trivial 2D band (a trivializing proximity effect, TPE). With the TPE, stronger disorder is more destructive to the surface states of the bulk lattice model. By contrast, without additional bands the surface states remain extended, exhibiting robust spectrum-wide quantum criticality. We also investigate the fragility of surface states in effective 2D class-CI continuum Dirac theories, including the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene. Although the continuum models exhibit signs of Anderson localization near gap edges for weak disorder, stronger disorder instead appears to heal the surface, restoring criticality whilst filling in spectral energy gaps. Our results provide further evidence that effective continuum field theories fail to capture key aspects of surface-state physics in localizable topological phases.

Atul Rathor, Sahanawaj Akhtar, Arijit Haldar

arXiv:2511.19616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict an in-plane, or hidden, Berry curvature (BC) for magnons in electrically insulating quasi-2D magnets and demonstrate that the hidden magnon Berry curvature (HMBC) gives rise to a previously unrecognized form of vertical, out-of-plane, magnon transport. Combining a semiclassical framework with Boltzmann transport theory, we show that the vertical magnon transport (VMT) currents respond both linearly and nonlinearly to the in-plane gradients of magnetic field and temperature. The linear transport coefficients are tied to the total hidden magnon BC, while the nonlinear (second-order) coefficients for the magnetic field and temperature gradients are determined by the hidden magnon BC dipole and the hidden extended magnon BC dipole, respectively. Using linear spin-wave theory, we find that the hidden magnon BC over the Brillouin zone is given by the expectation value of a pseudo-${{\cal Z}}$ operator, representing vertical displacements, evaluated in the space of paraunitary matrices that diagonalize the magnon Hamiltonian. We estimate VMT in spin models of realistic magnets with ferro- and antiferromagnetic order, including the buckled honeycomb (BHC) lattice and bilayer Chromium trihalide (CrX$_3$; X = Cl, Br, I) systems. In BHC, both linear and nonlinear VMT arise when time-reversal symmetry is broken by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. In CrX$_3$ systems, the nonlinear coefficients dominate, while the linear responses vanish due to time-reversal symmetry. Both systems exhibit distinctive features across a broad range of temperatures and parameters. Therefore, our prediction of VMT and its characteristic signatures is directly testable in present-day magnonic experiments, especially in atomically thin, few-layered van der Waals magnets.

Peize Ding, Nishchhal Verma, Raquel Queiroz

arXiv:2511.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit unconventional Landau level (LL) spectra that cannot be fully captured by an effective mass approximation or a minimal two-band Dirac model. Namely, TMDs show an anomalous, upward-sloping zeroth LL in the valence band and an asymmetric orbital magnetization between electron and hole bands. In this paper, we employ a continuum three-band model to derive analytic constraints on the LL spectrum of the $K$ and $K'$ valleys at weak magnetic fields. This model highlights the cyclic structure of the LL spectrum inherited from $C_3$ symmetry, providing both analytical tractability and an accurate description of the band geometry in the low energy approximation of the valleys. We compare our results against numerical calculations using the three-band tight-binding model of Ref.[1] and a distorted kagome lattice model. We find that the Landau levels of the $K$ and $K'$ valleys show a cyclic structure which explains their anomalous slope and magnetization asymmetry. This asymmetry can be traced to the topological obstruction of TMD semiconductors. We further analyze the impact of disorder, finding that the zeroth LL exhibits partial robustness against certain off-diagonal perturbations, in contrast to the exact index-theorem protection of massive Dirac particles. Our results establish a direct link between orbital structure, band topology, and magnetic response in TMDs.

Abstract: In this paper we present a theoretical examination of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a graphene monolayer integrated within an attenuated total internal reflection (ATR) configuration. By embedding graphene in this optical setup, we explore the enhancement in the nonlinear optical response, particularly focusing on the efficiency of SHG. Our analysis reveals that the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) plays a central role in significantly boosting the efficiency of SHG. The unique electronic properties of graphene, combined with the resonant characteristics of SPPs, create a synergistic effect that amplifies the nonlinear optical signals. This enhancement is attributed to the strong field confinement and the resonant nature of SPPs, which effectively increase the interaction between the incident light and the graphene monolayer. Furthermore, we analyze the underlying mechanisms that govern this process, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework that elucidates the interplay between graphene's electronic structure and the optical fields. Our findings suggest that the ATR scheme not only facilitates the excitation of SPPs but also optimizes the conditions for SHG.

Abstract: Among ultrawide bandgap semiconductors, beta-Ga2O3 is particularly promising for high power and frequency applications. For devices, n-type concentrations above 10^19 cm^-3 are required. Ge is a promising alternative n-type dopant with an ionic radius similar to Ga. Homoepitaxial 010 beta-Ga2O3 films were implanted with Ge to form 50 and 100 nm box concentration of 3*10^19 cm^-3 and 5*10^19 cm^-3, with damage ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 displacement per atom. For lower damage implants, optimized anneals in ultrahigh purity N2 at 950-1000 C for 5-10 minutes resulted in Rs of 600-700 omega/sqr, mobilities of 60-70 cm^2/Vs, and Ge activation of up to 40%. For higher damage implants, activation dropped to 23% with similar mobilities. Ge diffusion, measured by second ion mass spectrometry, showed formation of a Ge "clustering peak" with a concentration exceeding the initial implant following anneals in N2 or O2 at 950-1000 C. Beyond this peak, minimal Ge diffusion occurred for N2 anneals at 950 C, but at 1050 C non-Fickian diffusion extended to >200 nm. Electrical activation data suggests that clustered Ge is electrically inactive. To understand Ge clustering, several samples were characterized by synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Second-phase precipitates were observed in as-implanted samples which then fully dissoved after furnace annealing in N2 at 1050 C. Diffraction peaks suggest these implant-induced precipitates may be related to a high pressure Pa-3 phase of GeO2, and may evolve during anneals to explain the Ge clustering. Ultimately, we believe Ge clustering limits activation of implanted Ge at high concentrations.

arXiv:2511.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal gels form through the sol-gel transition of attractive particle suspensions, where local aggregation leads to a space-spanning network with solid-like properties. Their microstructure and mechanical properties are highly sensitive to external perturbations, which can substantially alter the pathway of network formation. Here, we investigate how nonlinear oscillatory shear affects the sol-gel transition of colloidal silica suspensions. Using large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS), we vary both the strain amplitude and the duration of oscillatory forcing, varying between one and two times the gelation time. We find that sufficiently large strain amplitudes, or prolonged exposure to oscillations in the nonlinear regime, alter irreversibly the gel properties: the storage modulus $G'$ decreases while its frequency dependence remains unchanged. In contrast, the loss modulus $G''$, which decreases monotonically with frequency under quiescent gelation, exhibits an upturn at high frequencies when the gel is formed under strong oscillatory shear. The viscoelastic spectra of gels formed under quiescent conditions are well captured by a fractional Maxwell model, while gels formed under LAOS require an additional fractional element to account for damage-induced dissipation. Rheo-imaging experiments corroborate this interpretation by revealing the growth of cracks in gels formed under LAOS. We further show that these gels display a progressively more ductile nonlinear response for prolonged exposure to LAOS during gelation. These results demonstrate that the interplay between non-linear shear and gelation can permanently imprint a macroscopic fracture pattern into colloidal gels, offering a route to tune their viscoelastic properties.

Abstract: Atomic orbitals underpin our understanding of electronic structure, providing intuitive descriptions of bonding, charge transfer, magnetism, and correlation effects. Despite their utility, an atomic basis that is adaptable, strictly localized on atomic centers, and enables accurate tight-binding interpolation has remained elusive. Here, we introduce Crystal Orbital Guided Iteration To atomic-Orbitals (COGITO), a framework that constructs an optimal atomic orbital basis by identifying and resolving key mathematical obstacles inherent to nonorthogonal bases--particularly uncontrolled orbital mixing, and the fixed-overlap constraint between orbitals. We demonstrate that COGITO enables tight-binding models as accurate as MLWF-based approaches, while preserving the ability of tight-binding parameters to represent the projected atomic basis--an essential feature lost in schemes that enforce orbital orthogonality or maximal localization. By creating accurate and chemically interpretable models of electronic structure, COGITO reveals the orbital-resolved covalent bonds and charge transfer that is encoded in the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions of DFT. Our method thus offers a powerful tool for any physics- or chemistry-based application that relies on a faithful description of local electronic structure.

Abstract: We use a recently-developed machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) trained on data generated with the density functional theory (DFT) and tailored to amorphous silicon coupled with the Activation-Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) to identify and classify two-level systems (TLS). The samples generated using MTP recover experimental results and provide average structural and dissipative properties similar to those obtained with a modified Stillinger-Weber potential, including radial distribution function, defect concentration and internal friction. Atomistic details, however, are significantly different, including the density and type of TLS. In particular, we find that while the density of TLS involving a bond-hopping mechanism is similar for the two potentials, more complex TLSs, such as those involving a Wooten-Winer-Weaire bond exchange, are about twice as common. Analysis also shows that TLSs, for MTP-based models, are mostly isolated and oscillate independently from each other.

arXiv:2511.19753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular dichroism (CD) and other chiroptical responses are a key probe of both chirality and momentum-space geometry in solids, but first-principles calculations are still challenging in periodic systems with strong exciton effects. Here, we develop a gauge-invariant first-principles framework for CD including exciton effects based on full minimal coupling (FMC) within the GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism. In contrast to standard multipole expansion and sum-over-states (SOS) approaches, which require careful gauge-fixing, converge slowly, and suffer origin ambiguities, FMC evaluates optical matrix elements directly at finite photon wavevector, naturally including intraband and near-degenerate transitions while placing electric-dipole (ED), magnetic-dipole (MD), and electric-quadrupole (EQ) contributions on equal footing. Applied to two prototypical two-dimensional chiral hybrid perovskites, (S-NEA)2PbBr4 and (S-MBA)2PbI4, our calculations reveal that MD and EQ channels contribute equally to the CD signal. Crucially, intraband and quasi-degenerate transitions only captured within FMC can significantly modify CD spectra, especially in systems with dense band degeneracies. The FMC framework, therefore, offers a computationally efficient and numerically robust way for predicting chiral optoelectronic phenomena in complex solids.

arXiv:2511.19782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalizable, physics informed strategy for generating training data that enables a machine learning force field accurate over a broad range of twist angles and stacking layer numbers in moire systems. Applying this to multilayer twisted MoTe2 (tMoTe2), we identify a structural and electronic stratification: the two moire interface (MI) layers retain substantial lattice reconstruction even in thick multilayers, while outer bulk like layers show rapidly attenuated distortions.Surprisingly, this stratification becomes strongest not in the ultra-small twist angle regime (<~1{\deg}), where in plane domain formation is well known, but rather at intermediate angles (2-5{\deg}). Simultaneously, interlayer hybridization across the MI-bulk boundary is strongly suppressed, leading to electronic isolation. In twisted double bilayer MoTe2, this stratification gives rise to coexisting honeycomb and triangular lattice motifs in the frontier valence bands. We further demonstrate that twist angle and weak gating can create energy shift of bands belonging to the two motifs, producing Chern band reordering and nonlinear electric polarization with modest hole doping. Our approach allows efficient simulation of multilayer moire systems and reveals structural-electronic separation phenomena absent in bilayer systems.

arXiv:2511.19787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we apply, for the first time, the fully atomistic force field approach to modeling light-induced deformations of azo-polymers, thereby establishing a relationship between macroscopic parameters and the microscopic molecular architecture of the used azo-polymers. We apply an orientation potential to mimic the illumination of the sample, in which the action of light is represented through controlled redistribution of azo-chromophores relative to the polarization direction. This strategy allows us to capture both the microscopic details of chromophore behaviour and the collective, anisotropic response of the polymer matrix. By combining these complementary perspectives, the simulations not only resolve the local mechanism of light-induced motion but also provide a pathway to bridge molecular-scale dynamics with mesoscopic deformation phenomena in azo-polymer films.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of an exciton condensate and associated collective modes in a bilayer configuration of $\text{MnBi}_2\text{Te}_4$, an antiferromagnetic topological insulator and van der Waals material, recognized for hosting axion physics. Utilizing a minimal low-energy Hamiltonian for the two layer system which is gapped by the intrinsic N\'eel order, we first employ mean-field theory to establish the conditions for exciton condensation. Our analysis identifies a nonzero, spin-singlet exciton order parameter which is tuned by external displacement field, temperature, and Coulomb attraction. Beyond the mean-field, we explore collective mode fluctuations in the uncondensed phase via many-body perturbation theory and the random phase approximation. From this, we derive the exciton spectral function which allows for a direct comparison between theoretical prediction and experimental observation. We detail how the softening of the collective mode peak is a function of the competition between interlayer detuning and thermal fluctuations. This work elucidates how the unique topological and magnetic environment of $\text{MnBi}_2\text{Te}_4$ offers a tunable platform for the realization and manipulation of exciton condensates and the corresponding collective excitations. Our findings contribute to understanding the interplay of topology and bosonic condensates, which could inspire application in optically accessing topological properties, dissipationless transport, and gate-tunable optoelectronics.

arXiv:2511.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice-matched GaP layers can be grown on Si(001) substrate via a two-step growth procedure, consisting of low-temperature nucleation followed by high-temperature overgrowth. Previous time-resolved spectroscopic studies on a thin GaP nucleation layer discovered a discrete electronic state and a phonon mode at 2 THz, both localized at the heterointerface and enhanced resonantly at pump photon energy of 1.4~eV. Here we investigate the influence of the high-temperature overgrowth on the interface electronic state and the 2-THz phonon mode. We find that the high-temperature overgrowth quenches the 1.4-eV resonances in the electronic transition and in the phonon amplitude, yet the 2-THz phonon mode is still observed after the overgrowth. Furthermore, the optical polarization-dependence of the phonon amplitude is qualitatively different between before and after the overgrowth. Our observations imply that the phonon frequency is defined by robust local atomic bondings such as Ga-Si at the heterointerface. The phonon amplitude, on the other hand, is determined by the coupling with the interface electronic transition, which is dominated by the discrete state before the overgrowth and by charge transfer between the valence bands of the two semiconductors after the overgrowth.

Abstract: Ultrafast quantum matter experiments have validated predictions from Floquet theory - notably, the dynamical modification of the electronic band structure and the light-induced anomalous Hall effect, via monotonic modulation of the driving amplitude. Here, we demonstrate how new physics is uncovered by leveraging quantum optimal control techniques to design Floquet amplitude modulation profiles. We discover a fundamentally different regime of topological transport, whereby the optimal oscillatory preparation protocol functions as a non-adiabatic topological pump: as a result, ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities emerge, that reach up to around seventy times the values one would expect from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state. The optimal protocols achieve >99% fidelity at the topological energy gap closing point - a twenty-fold improvement over standard monotonic approaches in as little as ten Floquet cycles - while unexpectedly generating the predicted ultrahigh conductivities. Our findings demonstrate that optimally prepared non-equilibrium quantum states can access transport regimes not achievable in the corresponding equilibrium system or even by applying conventional Floquet approaches, opening new avenues for ultrafast quantum technologies and topological device applications.

Abstract: The miniaturization of quantum Hall resistance standards (QHRS) using epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide necessitates understanding how device dimensions impact performance. This study reveals a pronounced scale-dependent carrier density in graphene Hall devices: under electron doping, carrier density decreases with increasing channel width (Wd), while the opposite occurs under hole doping. This phenomenon, most significant for Wd less than 400 um, directly influences the onset of magnetic field required for quantization. Fermi velocity measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) analysis indicate that band structure modifications and electron-electron interactions underlie this size dependence. Utilizing machine learning with limited data, we optimized the device geometry, identifying a channel width of ~360 um as the optimal balance between resistance uncertainty and on-chip integration density. This work provides key insights for designing high-performance, miniaturized graphene-based QHRS arrays.

Abstract: Polarons, quasiparticles formed through interactions between lattice and charge carriers (electrons and holes), strongly influence the electronic and optical properties of functional materials. In nanostructured BiVO$_{4}$, polaron formation and dynamics govern photocatalytic efficiency and charge transport, yet the microscopic nature remains not fully resolved. Here, using first-principles calculations, we report the formation of multi-centered polarons, in contrast to the more common single-centered states. Moreover, electron polarons exhibit pronounced anisotropy compared to the isotropic hole counterpart, reflecting a distinct character in charge-lattice coupling. These theoretical insights offer a direct interpretation of optical and spectroscopic experiments, providing strong evidence of anisotropic multi-centered polaronic behavior in BiVO$_{4}$. The presence of multiple in-gap states, especially from multi-centered polarons, introduces new channels for charge transport and recombination, possibly offering opportunities to control carrier dynamics in nanoscale photocatalytic and optoelectronic devices.

arXiv:2511.19860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard scaling theory dictates that disorder leads to immediate localization in one-dimensional Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology fundamentally alters this paradigm, protecting transport up to a substantial critical disorder strength. By employing a numerically stable log-space transfer matrix approach up to thermodynamic scales (N=1000), we identify a sharp phase transition from the topological skin phase to the Anderson localized phase. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that this transition belongs to a unique universality class with critical exponents \nu\approx1.50 and \beta\approx0.65. Furthermore, we map the global phase diagram, confirming that the critical disorder scales as W_c\propto\sqrt\gamma, consistent with localization suppression by an imaginary vector potential. Our results establish the rigorous limits of non-Hermitian topological protection in imperfect media.

Abstract: Different from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets, the bandgap of hBN nanoribbons (BNNRs) can be changed by spatial/electrostatic confinement. It has been predicted that a transverse electric field can narrow the bandgap and even cause an insulator-metal transition in BNNRs. However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that water adsorption greatly reduces bandgap of zigzag oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs). Ab initio calculations show that water adsorbed beside the BNNR induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2 V/nm thereby reducing its bandgap. Field effect transistors were successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of zBNNRs with adsorbates of water could be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements were taken to determine the optical bandgap in zBNNR. Wider zBNNRs exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17 eV. This study yields fundamental insights in new routes toward realizing electronic/optoelectronic devices and circuits based on hexagonal boron nitride.

arXiv:2511.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a flexible generative framework for modeling spin configurations in disordered yet strongly correlated phases of frustrated magnets. As a benchmark, we first demonstrate that an RBM can learn the zero-temperature ground-state manifold of the one-dimensional ANNNI model at its multiphase point, accurately reproducing its characteristic oscillatory and exponentially decaying correlations. We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking. These results highlight the utility of RBMs as generative models for learning constrained and highly frustrated magnetic states.

Abstract: Developing reliable pseudopotentials for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT), especially for transition metals, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for analyzing pseudization strategies for OF-DFT calculations. From the analysis arises a proposed pseudization method which involves constructing local pseudopotentials by targeting existing Kohn-Sham DFT pseudopotentials through an optimized effective potential procedure. We produce four distinct sets of local pseudopotentials and evaluate their accuracy and transferability on the transition metal elements. Our results indicate a substantial improvement over previously available pseudopotentials. Although current OF-DFT functionals still only reach a qualitative accuracy for transition metals, our newly developed pseudopotentials provide a rigorous framework for further methodological advancements.

Abstract: Type-II superconductors exhibit hysteretic behavior due to the presence of quantum vortices, and the order in which temperature and external field are varied plays a decisive role. Here we take current, rather than magnetic field, as the external drive. We image the magnetic field of a high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor strip after cooling. We confirm that even in zero magnetic field, current-biased cooling nucleates vortices within the strip. With a small external magnetic field, the distribution is polarized opposite to the Lorentz-force direction. These behaviors follow from the self-consistent relation between current and local field in steady flux flow. Our findings show that current history is encoded as vortices. This reveals self-field effects that influence dc measurements and glassy transitions under drive.

Justin Bennett

arXiv:2511.19915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Murray-type flux-radius laws, Gilbert-type concave transport costs, and Young-Herring triple-junction angle balances are usually treated as separate theories. This work shows that, within a natural class of quadratic, scale-free ledgers for branched networks, all three are different faces of a single structure controlled by one dimensionless index chi. Each edge carries a flux Q, an effective radius r, and a per-length ledger P(Q,r) encoding transport dissipation and structural burden. Under locality, evenness in Q, linear-response (quadratic) dependence, and an exact homogeneity ansatz in (Q,r), any admissible ledger reduces in the scale-free regime to the two-term form P(Q,r) = a Q^2 r^{-p} + b r^m. Local optimality then implies simultaneously: (i) a flux-radius power law with generalized Murray closures at degree-3 nodes; (ii) a Young-Herring-type vector balance with radius weights r^m and a fixed symmetric Y-junction angle; and (iii) an effective flux-only cost of Gilbert/branched-transport type with exponent beta. The exponents alpha and beta, the symmetric angle, and the split between transport and structural cost are all set by chi = m/(m+p) = beta/2. A rigidity theorem shows conversely that any quadratic ledger that yields power-law optimal radii and power-law flux-only cost on an open scaling cone must belong to this two-term family and obey the same Murray-Gilbert-Young dictionary. Examples for Poiseuille, diffusive, and geophysical trees illustrate how chi can be inferred from geometry and used as a falsifiable order parameter for scale-free branching architectures.

arXiv:2511.19939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective modulation of magnetic permeability plays a vital role in the development of high-performance inductors. Here, phase-field simulations of hard/soft ferrite composites (BaM/NiZn) clarify how exchange coupling and microstructure impact magnetic permeability. We show that particle size, volume fraction, and orientation of the hard phase can effectively control the transition from collinear to non-collinear coupling, with a critical exchange size r_cr approximately 12 nm. Increasing the hard-phase fraction deepens the anisotropy energy well and monotonically suppresses permeability. In contrast, rotating the BaM easy axis to 90 degrees relative to the applied field produces a strong enhancement: at a 10 nm radius and eta = 0.1 volume fraction, the effective permeability can be more than 30 times larger than in the parallel configuration and then saturates for larger particles. This study establishes a microstructure-permeability-based physical framework for designing hard/soft magnetic composite systems.

Abstract: The shift from point-based thermal sensing to filter-free thermal imaging requires luminescent thermometers that exhibit pronounced and thermally driven spectral changes within spectral regions matching the sensitivity profiles of the R, G, and B channels of a digital camera. In this work, we introduce such a system, enabled by the synergistic interplay between (i) thermal redistribution among the vibronic components of the 4T1 excited state of Mn2+ ions and (ii) thermally assisted population of this state via optical trap sites. These combined processes result in a simultaneous thermal enhancement and blueshift of the Mn2+ emission band associated with the 4T1 -> 6A1 electronic transition. Consequently, the emission intensity recorded in the G channel increases with temperature, while the luminescence signals detected in the B channel exhibit a corresponding decrease. As demonstrated, Ca19Zn2(PO4)14:Mn2+, Ce3+ supports not only sensitive filter-free thermal imaging, but also two additional ratiometric readout schemes: one based on the intensity ratio of Ce3+ and Mn2+ emissions, and another based on two distinct spectral regions of the Mn2+ emission band, yielding maximum relative sensitivities of 0.42% K^-1 and 2.7% K^-1, respectively. This approach introduces a unique thermometric strategy that enables simple, robust, and cost-effective two-dimensional thermal imaging without the need for optical filters or specialized instrumentation.

Abstract: The sensitivity of low dimensional superconductors to fluctuations gives rise to emergent behaviors beyond the conventional Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer framework. Anisotropy is one such manifestation, often linked to spatially modulated electronic states and unconventional pairing mechanisms. Pronounced in plane anisotropy recently reported at KTaO3 based oxide interfaces points to the emergence of a stripe order in superconducting phase, yet its microscopic origin and formation pathway remain unresolved. Here, we show that controlled interfacial disorder in MgO/KTaO3(111) heterostructures drives a percolative evolution from localized Cooper-pair islands to superconducting puddles and eventually to stripes. The extracted stripe width matches the spin precession length, suggesting a self organized modulation governed by spin orbit coupling and lattice-symmetry breaking. These findings identify disorder as both a tuning parameter and a diagnostic probe for emergent superconductivity in two dimensional quantum materials.

arXiv:2511.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature stability of skyrmion crystals in frustrated magnets by analyzing the momentum-space exchange interaction of a classical Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice. Our analysis identifies two key momentum-space features that play a crucial role in stabilizing the skyrmion crystal phase. The first is the sixfold anisotropy in the momentum-space exchange interaction, which acts as a locking potential favoring triple-$Q$ skyrmion crystals. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that a larger anisotropy tends to enhance the stability region of the skyrmion crystal in the temperature--magnetic-field phase diagram. The second factor is the momentum-space energy related to the uniform spin mode, which correlates with the emergence of the skyrmion crystal phase at finite temperatures. These results provide a further understanding of the stabilization mechanism of the skyrmion crystal phase in frustrated magnets and will be useful for the design of skyrmion-hosting materials.

Abstract: The pinch-off of bubbles in viscoelastic liquids is a fundamental process that has received little attention compared to viscoelastic drop pinch-off. While these processes exhibit qualitative similarities, the dynamics of the pinch-off process are fundamentally different. When a drop of a dilute polymer solution pinches off, a thread is known to develop that prevents breakup due the diverging polymer stresses. Conversely, our experiments reveal that this thread is absent for bubble pinch-off in dilute polymer solutions. We show that a thread becomes apparent only for high polymer concentrations, where the pinch-off dynamics become very sensitive to the size of the needle from which the bubble detaches. The experiments are complemented by numerical simulations and analytical modeling using the Oldroyd-B model, which capture the dilute regime. The model shows that polymer stresses are still singular during bubble pinch-off, but the divergence is much weaker as compared to drop pinch-off. This explains why, in contrast to droplets, viscoelastic bubble-threads do not appear for dilute suspensions but require large polymer concentrations

Abstract: Hybrid heterostructures combining transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with light-harvesting dyes are promising materials for next-generation optoelectronics. Yet, controlling and understanding interfacial charge transfer mechanisms in these complex systems remains a major challenge. Here, we investigate the microscopic origin of photoluminescence (PL) quenching in $\text{WSe}_2$ functionalized with a novel, strongly electron-deficient perylene monoimide dye, $\text{CN}_4\text{PMI}$. Experimentally, the hybridization induces a $\sim$97\% PL quenching in $\text{WSe}_2$, confirming substantial static charge transfer and increased $p$-doping from the dye. To isolate the dominant electronic mechanism, we investigate from first principles various interface morphologies, including differing molecular orientations and layer thicknesses. Our density-functional theory results confirm that $\text{CN}_4\text{PMI}$ acts as a strong electron acceptor, inducing $p$-doping and forming a type-II level alignment with all considered configurations, giving rise to a small or vanishing band gap. Based on these findings, we attribute the observed PL suppression in $\text{WSe}_2$ to these strong electronic interactions with the dye. Our study provides a clear and validated strategy for tailoring the electronic structure of TMDs through targeted, electron-deficient organic functionalization.

arXiv:2511.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal nucleation studies using hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones models have shown that the pressure within the nucleus is lower than that in the surrounding liquid. Here, we use the mechanical route to obtain it for an ice nucleus in supercooled water (TIP4P/Ice) at 1 bar and 247 K. From this (mechanical) pressure, we obtain the interfacial stress using a thermodynamic definition consistent with mechanical arguments. This pressure is compared with that of bulk ice at equal chemical potential (thermodynamic pressure), and the interfacial stress with the interfacial free energy. Furthermore, we investigate these properties on the basal plane. We find that, unlike in hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones systems, mechanical and thermodynamic pressures agree for the nucleus, and the interfacial stress and free energy are comparable. Yet the basal interface displays an interfacial stress nearly twice its interfacial free energy, suggesting that this agreement may be system dependent, underscoring the limitations of mechanical routes to solid-liquid interfacial free energies.

Abstract: Oxygen and other light elements comprise up to 5 wt% of the Earth's outer-core, and may significantly influence its physical properties and the operation of the geodynamo. Here we report in situ x-ray diffraction measurements of Fe, Fe + 4.5 FeO (atomic proportion), and Fe2O3 melts at 177-438 GPa, achieved using laser-driven shock compression at an x-ray free-electron laser. The melts exhibit Fe-O coordination numbers between 4.0(0.4) and 4.5(0.4), indicating predominantly four-fold coordination environments. These coordination states are significantly smaller than those of Fe-bearing lower-mantle phases such as bridgmanite and ferropericlase. Shorter Fe-Fe interatomic distances in compressed iron oxide melts drive the denser packing relative to ambient melts, while the structural differences between Fe + 4.5 FeO and Fe2O3 melts under shock indicate that the oxidation state modulates oxygen solubility in liquid Fe. At around 177 GPa (380 km below the core-mantle boundary), Fe2O3 melts exhibit higher Fe-O coordination, suggesting that local variations in oxygen content could contribute to the stratification in the uppermost outer-core inferred from seismological and geomagnetic observations.

Abstract: We discuss the choice and implementation of inter-valley potentials in the so-called two bands k.p model for the opposite X, Y or Z valleys of silicon. We focus on the description of valley splittings in Si/SiGe heterostructures for spin qubits, with a particular attention to alloy disorder. We demonstrate that the two bands k.p model reproduces the valley splittings of atomistic tight-binding calculations in relevant heterostructures (SiGe spikes, wiggle wells...), yet at a much lower cost. We show that the model also captures the effects of valley-orbit mixing and yields the correct inter-valley dipole matrix elements that characterize manipulation, dephasing and relaxation in spin/valley qubits. We simulate a realistic Si/SiGe spin qubit device as an illustration, and discuss electron-phonon interactions in the two bands k.p model. Beyond spin qubits, this model enables efficient simulations of SiGe heterostructure devices where spin and valley physics are relevant.

Abstract: Quantifying the in-plane rheology of epithelial monolayers remains challenging due to the difficulty of imposing controlled shear. We introduce a self-driven, rheometer-like assay in which collective migration generates stationary shear flows, allowing rheological parameters to be inferred directly from image sequences. The assay relies on two sets of ring-shaped fibronectin patches, micropatterned in arrays for high-throughput imaging. Within isolated rings, the epithelial tissue exhibits persistent rotation, from which we infer active migration stresses and substrate friction. Within partially overlapping rings, the tissue exhibits sustained shear, from which we infer the elastic and viscous responses of the cells. The emergence of a Maxwell-like viscoelastic relation --characterized by a linear relationship between mean cell deformation and neighbor-exchange rate-- is specifically recapitulated within a wet vertex-model framework, which reproduces experimental measurements only when intercellular viscous dissipation is included alongside substrate friction. We apply our method to discriminate the respective roles of two myosin~II isoforms in tissue mechanics. Overall, by harnessing self-generated stresses instead of externally imposed ones, we propose a noninvasive route to rheological inference in migrating epithelial tissues and, more generally, in actively flowing granular materials.

arXiv:2511.20163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently showed that the two-dimensional Ising spin glass allows for a line of renormalization group fixed points. We observe that this exact result corresponds to enhancement to a one-generator continuous internal symmetry. This finally explains why no finite temperature transition to a spin glass phase is observed in two dimensions. In more than two dimensions, instead, the continuous symmetry can be broken spontaneously and yields a spin glass order parameter which, for fixed temperature and disorder strength, takes continuous values in an interval. Such a feature is shared by the order parameter of the known mean field solution of the model with infinite-range interactions, which corresponds to infinitely many dimensions.

Abstract: Bilayer graphene is a maturing material platform for gate-defined quantum dots that hosts long-lived spin and valley states. Implementing solid-state qubits in bilayer graphene requires a fundamental understanding of such confined electronic systems. In particular, states of two and three carriers, for which the exchange interaction between particles plays a crucial role, are a cornerstone for qubit readout and manipulation. Here we report on the spectroscopy of few-carrier states in bilayer graphene quantum dots, using circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques that offer substantially improved energy resolution compared to standard transport techniques. Measurements using a superconducting high-impedance resonator capacitively coupled to the double quantum dot reveal dispersive features of two and three electron states, enabling the detection of Pauli spin and valley blockade and the characterization of the spin-orbit gap at zero magnetic field. The results deepen our understanding of few-carrier spin and valley states in bilayer graphene quantum dots and demonstrate that cQED techniques are a powerful state-selective probe for semiconductor nanostructures.

Abstract: Under high pressure, the group-VB transition metals vanadium (V) and niobium (Nb) exhibit simple crystal structures but complex physical behaviors, such as anomalous compression-induced softening and heating-induced hardening (CISHIH). Meanwhile, the impact of lattice thermal expansion-induced softening at elevated temperatures on HIH is yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study utilized ab initio (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) to investigate the melting and abnormal mechanical softening-hardening behaviors of V and Nb under high pressure. Simulations reveal that the high-temperature Pnma phase of Nb reported in previous experimental studies is highly susceptible to mechanical instability and reverts to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. This discovery prompted a revised determination of the high-pressure melting line of Nb. The melting temperature of Nb significantly exceeds the existing theoretical and experimental estimate compared with that of V. AIMD simulations demonstrate that atomic thermal displacements have a greater influence on the HIH of V and Nb than pure electron temperature effects. In addition, the temperature-dependent anomalous elastic properties of V and Nb were investigated within a pressure range of 0-250 GPa using MLMD. The mechanical properties of V and Nb transitioned from HIH to heating-induced softening, elucidating the competition between thermal-expansion-induced softening and HIH.

Abstract: This paper deals with the photochemical preparation of nanomaterials with garnet structure. Ce3+ and Mg2+ doped Lu2.5Gd0.5Ga2Al3O12 powders were prepared by using UV irradiation of aqueous solutions with low-pressure mercury lamps and subsequent calcination of the solid products. The synthesis was optimized and gives access to a range of doping which is very hard to achieve with single crystal growth from melt. The effect of Ce and Mg concentration on the structural and luminescence properties was studied. Garnets were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and their luminescence properties under optical and X-ray photon excitations were investigated. XRF and XRD show that the samples are sufficiently chemically pure and phase-pure and their elemental composition corresponds with expectations. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy confirmed that Mg concentrations in Mg-codoped samples are slightly lower than the nominal. Luminescence spectra show typical emission maxima of 5d-4f Ce3+ transition and 4f-4f Gd3+ transition. The effects of the concentration of Ce3+ and Mg2+ on the RL intensity, light yields and decays were observed.

Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear Hall responses in tunable two-dimensional Dirac materials. In particular, we study quantum geometry-driven second and third order non-linear responses in a time-reversal symmetric Dirac semimetal that can host single, double and line nodes depending on the model parameters. We find that the second-order Hall response (SOHE), which originates from the Berry curvature dipole, is enhanced in the single-node semimetallic phase as compared to the double node case when inversion symmetry is broken. In contrast, the SOHE vanishes in the nodal line semimetal as the inversion symmetry retains. Notably, the third-order Hall response due to Berry connection polarizabilty becomes much larger in the line-node Dirac semimetal, especially when the Fermi energy lies near the band edge, than in the single- and double-node Dirac semimetals. The reason for this contrasting behavior is attributed to the distinct distribution of the Berry connection polarizability in the Brillouin zone.

Abstract: Flat-band lattices hosting compact localized states are highly sensitive to external modulation, and the tailored design of a perturbation to imprint specific features becomes relevant. Here we show that periodic driving in the high-frequency regime transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one featuring two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band pinned at $E=0$. The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally. The resulting drive-engineered quasi-flat bands thus provide a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, revealing a direct link between spectral fine structure and dynamical entanglement.

arXiv:2511.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Kitaev honeycomb model employing the recently developed Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) method. While the model in the gapped phase is known to reduce to the toric code model - whose ground state is entirely constructible from Clifford circuits - we demonstrate that the very different gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase can also be significantly disentangled with Clifford circuits. Specifically, CAMPS simulations reveal that approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point arises from Clifford-circuit contributions, enabling dramatically more efficient computations compared to conventional matrix product state (MPS) methods. Crucially, this finding implies that the Kitaev QSL state retains significant Clifford-simulatable structure, even in the gapless phase with non-abelian anyon excitations when time reversal symmetry is broken. This property not only enhances classical simulation efficiency significantly but also suggests substantial resource reduction for preparing such states on quantum devices. As an application, we leverage CAMPS to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and determine the most accurate phase boundary between the anti-ferromagnetic phase and the Kitaev QSL phase in the model. Our results highlight how Clifford circuits can effectively disentangle the intricate entanglement of Kitaev QSLs, opening avenues for efficiently simulating related and similar strongly correlated models.

Abstract: Josephson junctions form the core circuit element in superconducting quantum computing circuits, single flux quantum digital logic circuits, and sensing devices such as SQUIDs. Aluminum oxide has typically been used as the tunnel barrier. Its formation by exposure to low oxygen pressures at room temperature for short periods of time makes it susceptible to aging and limits the thermal budget of downstream processes. In this paper, we report the first demonstration of {\alpha}-Ta/insulating TaN/a-Ta superconductor/insulator/superconductor Josephson junctions fabricated on 300 mm wafers using CMOS-compatible processes. The junctions were fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates using standard processes available at 300 mm scale, including 193 nm optical lithography, ALD of TaN in a cluster tool, and chemical mechanical planarization to enable highly planar interfaces. Junction areas ranging from 0.03 um2 to 9 um2 with ALD TaN thickness between 2 nm and 7 nm were characterized. A critical current density of 76 uA/um2 was observed in junctions using 4 nm ALD TaN in the tunnel barrier. The dependence of Jc on ALD TaN layer thickness is analyzed, and the influence of junction geometry, packaging, and temperature on I-V characteristics is discussed. Junctions were retested after a period of 4 months to quantify junction aging. The potential of this novel material system and a 300 mm superconducting junction process flow to fabricate thermally and environmentally stable junctions is discussed. The vision of a Superconducting Quantum Process Design Kit for a Multi-Project Wafer program to enable rapid development and proliferation of superconducting quantum and digital digital logic systems is presented. This work represents the first step towards establishing such a Quantum Foundry, providing access to high quality qubits and single-flux quantum logic circuits at 300 mm wafer scale.

Abstract: Hybrid quasiparticles that intertwine magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom underpin emerging strategies for manipulating and transducing quantum information in solids. A key missing element has been the ability to optically access dark excitons - optically forbidden but functionally crucial states that shape energy flow, coherence, and spin dynamics in quantum materials. Here we show that exciton-magnon coupling provides an optical gateway to dark excitons in the antiferromagnetic van der Waals semiconductor CrSBr. Broadband femtosecond reflectivity reveals a dark exciton at 1.46 eV that is entirely absent in static optical spectra but becomes visible through its coherent hybridization with a GHz magnon. High-photon-energy excitation further allows active control of the hybrid dispersion, enabling strong renormalization and selective enhancement of exciton-magnon interactions. These results establish a general mechanism by which magnetic order renders dark excitons optically addressable, opening a pathway toward engineered hybrid spin-exciton platforms for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction.

arXiv:2511.20287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-driven motion of domain walls and skyrmions is central to the operation of non-volatile magnetic memory devices. Racetrack memory requires current densities high enough to generate velocities above 50 m/s, but such conditions also enhance spin-current noise. We develop a theoretical framework based on the stochastic Thiele equation to analyze the effects of equilibrium (thermal) and nonequilibrium (spin-current) fluctuations on skyrmion dynamics. From this approach, we derive diffusion coefficients and mean-squared displacements that quantify stochastic motion under both noise sources. Micromagnetic simulations and analytical results demonstrate that spin-current noise dominates skyrmion dynamics in typical racetrack structures up to room temperature. We further address the first-passage-time problem, obtaining the mean first-passage time and its standard deviation along and across the racetrack. These results quantify how random displacements affect skyrmion propagation and detection, providing insights into error sources in high-speed racetrack memory devices.

Abstract: Landau level (LL) engineered photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) holds great promise for nanoscale manipulation and steering of magneto-optical transport in two-dimensional atomic systems. Herein, we theoretically investigate PSHE modulated by LL transitions {\delta}n = n'-n =-2, 0, +2 (where n and n' indicate the LL indexes of valence and conduction bands, respectively) in monolayer WTe2. Results show that PSHE tuned by {\delta}n =-2, 0, +2 has completely different dependent behaviors on LLs, incident angle of incident photons, and magnetic induction intensity. These discrepancies are ascribed to Hall-conductivity-incurred Hall angle {\Theta} because the variation tendency of photonic spin Hall shifts is similar to that of {\Theta} with changing the LL index. Giant PSHE with the largest in-plane displacement of more than 400 times of incident wavelength is obtained at the transition |n=55>->|n'=57>. Remarkably enhanced PSHE occurs at near-zero Hall angles. In-plane and transverse spin-dependent displacements give their respective extremum values at the same incident angles when the {\Theta} is near to zero, and their incident-angle deviation will become larger and larger as the |{\Theta}| increases. This unambiguously confirms the strong influence of Hall angle in the PSHE, shedding important insights into the fundamental properties of spin-orbit interaction of light in time-reversal symmetry breaking quantum systems.

Abstract: The human brain, with its energy-efficient and massively parallel architecture seamlessly integrates memory and computation. Its topology and functionality serve as the inspiration for the field of neuromorphic computing. Realizing brain-like hardware requires the integration of fundamental properties such as synaptic plasticity, self-organization, hierarchical and modular structures, as well as three-dimensional connectivity. Current challenges lie in developing liquid based neuromorphic material systems with facile fabrication, three-dimensional processing, and brain-like conductivity. This work presents ionotronic systems - i.e., systems that incorporate the movement of both electrons and ions - to obtain dynamically reconfigurable conductive filaments. Our method employs an electrolyte where an anode reservoir produces ions in-situ, enabling electrode-dependent tunability and sustained operation without ion depletion. This manuscript presents four ionotronic systems. Each system grows brain inspired three-dimensional wires contacting two or more electrodes exhibiting resistive switching at connection on a micrometer scale as well as a nanometer scale, demonstrating hierarchical organization and functionality. Furthermore, these conducting filaments are capable of being disrupted by an external electric field or dissolved over time in the ionotronic system, emulating blooming and pruning aspects of plasticity.

arXiv:2511.20326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion of an impurity under the action of a constant force through a one-dimensional system of weakly-interacting bosons. The interplay of the impurity-boson interaction, the boson-boson interaction, and the driving force gives rise to a rich dynamics. We focus on the influence of a finite external force. Under these far-from-equilibrium conditions, we show that in a wide range of forces, one part of the momentum transferred to the system is periodically channeled into the Bose gas through the emission of dispersive density shock waves, solitons, density waves and the creation of additional phase gradients. As a result, the impurity velocity does not increase indefinitely, but periodically oscillates in time around the drift velocity. We uncover and characterize different dynamical regimes in a wide range of the impurity-boson coupling, the impurity mass and the external force. At a sufficiently large force, the Bloch oscillations cease and the impurity exhibits an unlimited acceleration.

Abstract: Friction is ubiquitous in daily life, from nanoscale machines to large engineering components. By probing the intricate interplay between system parameters and frictional behavior, scientists seek to unveil the underlying mechanisms that enable prediction and control of friction - an essential step toward carbon neutrality. Yet, reproducing frictional behavior in experiments is notoriously difficult. Here, we show that this challenge stems from the extreme sensitivity of tribological systems to tiny variations, e.g. in surface topography, typically presumed well- controlled. Even after meticulous surface preparation to semiconductor-industry standards and curtailing misalignment-induced oscillations, subtle variations remain and interact. In turn, such minute initial differences lead to statistically significant variations in friction and wear, giving rise to system-level chaotic behavior. Yet, by leveraging mid-scale features of surface topography and misalignment-induced oscillations - information often filtered out or overlooked - we established a model that accurately predicts high-friction regions under vastly different lubrication scenarios, with its performance further enhanced by machine learning.

Abstract: Fission gas swelling and release in UO$_2$ are governed by the coupled evolution of intragranular clusters and bubbles, migrating grain boundaries (GBs), triple junctions (TJs), and their eventual connection to a free surface (FS). We extend a hybrid multiscale framework that couples cluster dynamics (Xolotl) with a phase-field model (MARMOT) to large 3D polycrystals with heterogeneous GB and surface diffusion and evolving GB networks. We simulate 10- and 100-grain UO$_2$ microstructures at 1200 and 1600 K, with and without a FS, to interrogate bubble growth, coalescence, GB/TJ coverage, gas arrival at interfaces, and fission gas release (FGR). At 1200 K, both GB mobility and gas transport are low, yielding negligible bubble and GB evolution. At 1600 K, intergranular bubbles rapidly become lenticular and coalesce into networks while unpinned GBs migrate; fewer initial bubbles reduce coalescence but enhance GB migration due to less pinning and produce spikes in interfacial gas arrival rate due to GB sweeping. Bubble density versus mean projected area agrees with White's (2004) coalescence trend and remains on the left side of the analytical curve, in contrast to several prior simulations, likely due to the inclusion of GB migration. In domains with a FS, early release is rapid and bubbles near the FS collapse to form a denuded zone, suppressing local network connectivity; GB coverage rises and approaches but does not exceed 50%. TJ coverage remains low without preferential nucleation at TJs. To our knowledge, these are the first large-scale 3D mesoscale simulations of intergranular fission gas behavior that provide mechanistic insight and quantitative metrics to inform engineering-scale FGR models.

arXiv:2511.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport in highly anharmonic, amorphous, or alloyed materials often deviates from the predictions of conventional phonon-based models. First-principles approaches have introduced a coherent contribution to account for these deviations and to explain ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity, but direct experimental evidence for this mechanism remains elusive. Here, we propose that the frequency-dependent lattice thermal conductivity, $\kappa(\nu)$, provides a direct signature of coherent transport. Specifically, we show that peaks in $\kappa(\nu)$ arise from the frequency nesting of modes with identical wave vectors. Applying this approach to CuCl, we identify clear signatures of coherent transport in its dynamical lattice thermal conductivity. We revisit the interpretation of thermoreflectance experiments and argue that the conventional understanding breaks down in strongly anharmonic crystals, alloys, and amorphous materials. Finally, we discuss experimental pathways to measure $\kappa(\nu)$, offering a new route to verify coherent contributions in thermal transport.

Abstract: Single-molecule junctions represent electromechanical systems at the edge of device miniaturization. Despite extensive studies on the interplay between mechanical manipulation and electron transport in molecular junctions, a thorough understanding of conducting molecular springs remains elusive. Here, we investigate the impact of mechanical elongation and compression on the electron transport and electronic structure of helicene-based spring-like single-molecule junctions, utilizing 2,2'-dithiol-[6]helicene and thioacetyl-[13]helicene molecules bridging two gold electrodes. We observe robust, reversible U-shaped conductance variations with interelectrode distance. Ab-initio electronic structure and quantum transport calculations reveal that this behavior stems from destructive quantum interference, induced mainly by modifications of the coupling at the metal-molecule interface as a peculiar outcome of the helical backbone deformation. These findings highlight the central role of the helical geometry in combination with contact properties in the electromechanical response of conducting molecular springs, offering insights for designing functional electromechanical devices that leverage similar mechanisms.

Abstract: Ferrimagnets, composed of antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic sublattices whose net magnetisation can be tuned by temperature, offer a unique platform for probing the symmetry of the spin currents they generate and for identifying the sublattice contributions to these currents. Here, we investigate the spin current symmetries produced by GdFeCo ferrimagnet at a fixed concentration and across a broad temperature range, including the magnetisation compensation point. Using complementary techniques based on spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE). We show that the torques arising from both mechanisms retain their sign across the magnetisation compensation temperature, and that the SAHE-driven damping-like torque has the opposite sign to the SHE-driven term. We suggest that both effects originates from distinct electronic subsystems: the SHE emerging from Gd 5d electrons, and the SAHE from FeCo 3d electrons. Consequently, the SHE sign remains insensitive to the magnetisation state, whereas the SAHE sign does not invert at compensation, reproducing our observations. Together, these insights clarify the interplay between sublattices in ferrimagnetic spin transport and highlight the potential of ferrimagnetic spin currents to generate spin torques in adjacent layers or within the ferrimagnet itself.

Abstract: Twisted two-dimensional semiconductors generate a moir\'e landscape that confines excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) into programmable lattices, offering routes to efficient light sources, sensing, and room-temperature information processing. However, direct real-space imaging of confined excitonic species within a moir\'e unit cell remains challenging; existing claims are inferred from spatially averaged far-field signals that are intrinsically insufficient to resolve nanometre-scale variations. Here, we imaged excitons across the moir\'e of a 2$^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ with nanometre resolution using room-temperature photocurrent atomic force microscopy. We directly resolved site-selective confinement: direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries of the moir\'e, with contrast governed by alignment between site-selective generation and confinement minima. A Wannier-based moir\'e-exciton model reproduces the measured energies and the moir\'e-induced localization of the exciton wavefunction. These species-specific, unit-cell-resolved measurements constrain microscopic models of moir\'e excitons, provide benchmarks for excitonic order, and establish a device-compatible route to engineering excitonic lattices in van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: Elements with low thermal neutron absorption cross-sections are ideal for enhancing structural materials in nuclear systems. In this study, We systematically investigate the segregation and co-segregation behaviors of eleven elements at the {\Sigma}7(0001) twist grain boundary in yttrium and their effects on stability and strength. The {\Sigma}7(0001) grain boundary exhibits weakening, with fracture occurring preferentially along path I. Segregation energy calculations show that Si, Cu, Cr, Mo and Fe prefer interstitial sites, while others occupy substitutional ones. Si, Al, Zn, Cu, Mg and Fe stabilize the boundary, while Mo, Fe, Si, Cr, Cu, Nb and Ti strengthen it, with Si offering the most balanced improvement. Co-segregation studies reveal that Si induces the enrichment of other solutes at the boundary, promoting synergistic stabilization and turning embrittling elements (Al, Mg, Zn, Zr) into strengthening agents. Electronic structure analysis shows that Si-Y covalent bonds enhance electron localization, and Si+Mg co-segregation optimizes electronic distribution through metallic-covalent cooperation, significantly improving fracture resistance. The density of states analysis indicates new low-energy deep states in the Si, and Si+Al, Si+Mg systems, which lower grain boundary energy and improve stability. This study provides guidance for designing high-performance, low-neutron-absorption Y-based alloys.

Abstract: Josephson junctions are key elements in superconducting electronics. The most common type is the overlap (sandwich-type) junction, formed by vertically stacking two superconducting layers. In contrast, planar junctions are fabricated without overlap, at the edge of two superconducting films within a single plane. This geometric distinction has a significant impact on their physical properties. The planar geometry greatly enhances sensitivity to magnetic fields and improves impedance matching for terahertz (THz) devices. Its two-dimensional structure allows for simple and flexible electronic component design, enabling drastic miniaturization. Here I highlight recent advances in the application of planar junctions for novel technologies, including junction-on-cantilever sensors for super-resolution magnetic imaging, vortex-based memory cells, and programmable superconducting diodes. I will also discuss the general requirements, future perspectives, and key challenges in the evolving field of superconducting electronics.

Abstract: The complex valence band structure of bulk cuprous oxide necessitates going beyond the parabolic approximation to precisely estimate exciton binding energies. The same is true for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells, for which many effects have been obtained so far only qualitatively within a hydrogenlike two-band model. Here, we derive the complete Hamiltonian for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells based on the Luttinger-Kohn model, taking into account the full complex valence band structure. Symmetry properties of the system are discussed. Numerical results based on the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian using B-spline functions reveal the energy shifts and the lifting of degeneracies due to the nondiagonal coupling terms of the complex valence band. The relative oscillator strengths of the excitonic transitions induced by circularly polarized light are also calculated.

Abstract: Thanks to improved methods for numerical analytic continuation with constraints, spectral functions with sharp features can now be extracted from imaginary-time correlation functions computed by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Here we test these new approaches on various one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin systems with a single ejected fermion, i.e., extracting the single-hole spectral function $A(k,\omega)$. We compute the Green's function $G(r,\tau)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,\omega)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=\pi$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation. Our results overall demonstrate the power of modern analytic continuation tools in combination with large-scale QMC simulations.

Abstract: Magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and reshape a material's spatial symmetry. Because the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is exquisitely sensitive to symmetry, it offers a natural arena for magnetic-field control. Here, we explore how shift current (SC) and magnetic ballistic current (MBC) evolve and emerge in AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We find that the SC responds only mildly to weak fields, behaving as an almost even function of field strength. In contrast, the MBC is activated directly by TRS breaking and grows linearly with weak fields at selected photon energies. Focusing on AB-bilayer graphene ribbon we investigate the behavior of SC and MBC under both weak and strong vertical fields. We uncover the strikingly opposite roles played by edge states in the SC: under weak fields these highly localized, sublattice- and layer-polarized edge modes are essentially dark, yet under strong fields - when Landau levels dominate - the same edge states swell in spatial extent and become intensely bright contributors to the SC response.

Abstract: The development of next-generation molecular simulation models requires moving beyond pre-defined functional forms toward machine learning (ML) techniques that directly capture multiscale physics. Here, we demonstrate such an approach using symbolic regression (SR) with equation learner networks and a reinforcement learning search engine to derive interpretable equations for interatomic interactions. Training data were generated through nested ensemble sampling with density functional theory (DFT) energetics, spanning crystalline to highly disordered states. The optimization of the learner network employed continuous-action Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) combined with gradient descent, enabling efficient exploration of function space. For copper as a representative transition metal, an unconstrained search produced models that outperformed fixed-form Sutton-Chen EAM potentials. The SR-derived models (SR1 and SR2) reproduced key material properties - lattice constants, cohesive energies, equations of state, elastic constants, phonon dispersion, defect formation energies, surface/bulk energetics, and phase transformation with significantly improved accuracy. Furthermore, stringent melting simulations using two-phase solid-amorphous interfaces confirmed that SR models accurately capture the interplay of vibrational entropy, cohesive energy, and structural dynamics, surpassing SC-EAM in both qualitative and quantitative predictions. This highlights the potential of SR to deliver fast, accurate, flexible, and physically meaningful potentials, advancing predictive modeling across scales.

Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect traditionally arises from complex spin-orbital interactions in multiferroic materials. In this work, we propose a distinct, intrinsic mechanism for the magnetoelectric effect in quasi-2D magnetic systems that lack spatial inversion symmetry. We demonstrate that in such parity-violating magnets, the stacking order, which id coupled with Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, generates a stacking Berry curvature dipole (SBCD) and a stacking orbital magnetic moment dipole (SOMD). The SBCD and SOMD act as fundamental ingredients of the ME response. As concrete examples, we apply our framework to antiferromagnets such as monolayer Ca(CoN)$_2$ and multilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with stacking magnetic orders. Our results reveal the microscopic orbital origin of the ME effect in antiferromagnetic systems with vanishing net Berry curvature and orbital magnetization, governed by the interplay between layer stacking, Berry curvature, and magnetic order. The SBCD is also identified as the origin of electric-field-induced Hall effects.

Abstract: Quantum circuits provide an emerging controllable platform to realize novel dynamical non-equilibrium phases including topologically ordered states. The Kitaev model has become a cornerstone of quantum magnetism due to its quantum spin liquid ground state and rich phase diagram. The Kitaev model has also been treated in the monitored circuit setting, giving rise to topological area-law and critical-law entanglement entropy phases. In this article, we study the evolution of its phase diagram under the addition of new terms, motivated by their effects in the Kitaev model. We find that a single-qubit term, analogous to a magnetic field, leads to a trivial state in the high field limit, but with an additional intermediate volume-law phase. A three-qubit operator that commutes with the flux operators has the opposite effect: it stabilizes the critical-law phase against the short ranged area-law entanglement. We also employ a four-qubit plaquette commuting operator that simultaneously measures two opposite identical-type bonds on a plaquette. This generates a distinct volume-law phase and preserves the plaquette fluxes and associated topological order, yielding extensive entanglement while coexisting with the topological memory characteristic of the area-law phase. We quantitatively locate phase boundaries using stabilizer (Clifford) simulations together with tripartite mutual information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results highlight the rich phase diagram accessible from the measurement-only Kitaev model as well as suggesting rules relating the newly added operators to the phases they promote.

Abstract: A sessile water droplet on a cold substrate freezes into a shape with a sharp apex because of water's expansion upon freezing, yielding a universal tip angle across various conditions. Using \textit{in situ} X-ray imaging, we report that this angle changes with substrate temperature, and the deviation originates from bubble formation during freezing. Three-dimensional tomography enables direct quantification of the effective ice-water density ratio, accounting for trapped bubbles. Incorporating this effective density ratio reconciles the temperature-dependent tip angles. We also confirm that a bubble-free frozen droplet in a vacuum chamber exhibits the universal tip angle. Furthermore, X-ray imaging allows us to measure the three-phase boundary angles \textit{in situ}, thereby validating the geometric theory behind tip formation. These findings advance our understanding of the freezing dynamics associated with multiphase systems and highlight the capabilities of high-resolution X-ray imaging in ice research.

Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of superfluidity for hard-core dark excitons on the triangular lattice by mapping the large-$U$ Bose--Hubbard model to an effective XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Hamiltonian including virtual hopping processes. Within this framework, we identify the superfluid phase that emerges between the two Mott-insulating endpoints at fillings 0 and 1, and derive its mean-field structure via a canted-spin solution. We then construct the corresponding continuum Landau-Ginzburg (LG) functional and analyze phase fluctuations and vortex dynamics. In two dimensions, the superfluid--normal transition is shown to be governed by a Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) mechanism with a stiffness determined by microscopic parameters. Our results provide a unified description connecting lattice-scale exciton dynamics to continuum critical behavior in triangular geometries.

Abstract: The two-species cold atomic Fermi gas with attractive short-range interactions in two spatial dimensions undergoes a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) crossover as a function of $\ln (k_F a)$, where $a$ is the scattering length. However, the nature of this crossover in the strong coupling regime $\ln(k_F a) \sim 1$ remains poorly understood. In this work we use canonical-ensemble auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo methods on discrete lattices to calculate several thermodynamical quantities in the strongly interacting regime, and eliminate systematic errors by extrapolating to continuous time and taking the continuum limit. In particular, we present results for the condensate fraction, spin susceptibility, contact, energy equation of state, and the free energy staggering gap. We identify signatures of a pseudogap regime, in which pairing correlations survive above the critical temperature for superfluidity, in the spin susceptibility and in the free energy staggering gap. These results can be used as a benchmark for future experiments.

Abstract: Topological principles constitute at present an integral component of condensed matter physics, permeating the modern characterization of electronic states while also guiding materials design. In this brief Perspective, I highlight three research threads in single-particle topological band theory that have recently gained momentum: (i) the rise of the quantum geometric tensor, whose components can at present be directly accessed with optical probes; (ii) the notions of delicate and multigap topology, which fall outside the scope of tenfold way and symmetry-based indicators yet leave robust physical fingerprints; and (iii) the consideration of bundle gerbes, which capture formerly overlooked higher-form topological aspects of energy bands. These distinct directions have been elegantly woven together: delicate and multigap topological insulators have peculiar features in quantum geometry that can be conveniently captured by bundle gerbes. This viewpoint exposes the recently identified quantization of a non-linear optical response and provides outlooks for its realization in crystalline solids.

Abstract: The transport properties and electrical bandgap of nominally undoped ~75-nm-thick CrN layers simultaneously grown on AlN(0001) and AlN(11\bar{2}2) templates using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy are investigated. The layers grown on AlN(0001) and AlN(11\bar{2}2) exhibit (111) and (113) surface orientations, respectively. All layers exhibit antiferromagnetism with a N\'eel temperature of ~280 K, observed by temperature-dependent magnetic and electrical measurements. Hall-effect measurements demonstrate n-type semiconducting behavior across a wide temperature range from 4 to 920 K. At low temperatures (4 - 260 K), the data show parallel conduction channels from a metallic impurity band and the conduction band. The carrier mobility exhibits a temperature dependence consistent with a nondegenerate semiconductor, governed by ionized-impurity scattering below 400 K and phonon scattering above 400 K. An analysis of the temperature-dependent carrier density between 300 and 920 K yields two activation energies associated with intrinsic conduction: 0.15 eV (with an uncertainty of -0.02/+0.10 eV), which we attribute to the fundamental bandgap, and 0.50 eV (with an uncertainty of -0.05/+0.15 eV) representing a higher energy transition.

Abstract: In diffraction-based crystal structure analysis, thermal ellipsoids, quantified via Anisotropic Displacement Parameters (ADPs), are critical yet challenging to determine. ADPs capture atomic vibrations, reflecting thermal and structural properties, but traditional computation is often expensive. This paper introduces CartNet, a novel graph neural network (GNN) for efficiently predicting crystal properties by encoding atomic geometry into Cartesian coordinates alongside the crystal temperature. CartNet integrates a neighbour equalization technique to emphasize covalent and contact interactions, and a Cholesky-based head to ensure valid ADP predictions. We also propose a rotational SO(3) data augmentation strategy during training to handle unseen orientations. An ADP dataset with over 200,000 experimental crystal structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) was curated to validate the approach. CartNet significantly reduces computational costs and outperforms existing methods in ADP prediction by 10.87%, while delivering a 34.77% improvement over theoretical approaches. We further evaluated CartNet on other datasets covering formation energy, band gap, total energy, energy above the convex hull, bulk moduli, and shear moduli, achieving 7.71% better results on the Jarvis Dataset and 13.16% on the Materials Project Dataset. These gains establish CartNet as a state-of-the-art solution for diverse crystal property predictions. Project website and online demo: https://www.ee.ub.edu/cartnet

Abstract: We study the statistics of the number of real eigenvalues in the elliptic deformation of the real Ginibre ensemble. As the matrix dimension grows, the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the number of real eigenvalues are well understood, but the probabilities of rare events remain largely unexplored. Large deviation type results have been obtained only in extreme cases, when either a vanishingly small proportion of eigenvalues are real or almost all eigenvalues are real. Here, in both the strong and weak asymmetry regimes, we derive the probabilities of rare events in the moderate-to-large deviation regime, thereby providing a natural connection between the previously known regime of Gaussian fluctuations and the large deviation regime. Our results are new even for the classical real Ginibre ensemble.

Abstract: We present a long-horizon, hierarchical deep research (DR) agent designed for complex materials and device discovery problems that exceed the scope of existing Machine Learning (ML) surrogates and closed-source commercial agents. Our framework instantiates a locally deployable DR instance that integrates local retrieval-augmented generation with large language model reasoners, enhanced by a Deep Tree of Research (DToR) mechanism that adaptively expands and prunes research branches to maximize coverage, depth, and coherence. We systematically evaluate across 27 nanomaterials/device topics using a large language model (LLM)-as-judge rubric with five web-enabled state-of-the-art models as jurors. In addition, we conduct dry-lab validations on five representative tasks, where human experts use domain simulations (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) to verify whether DR-agent proposals are actionable. Results show that our DR agent produces reports with quality comparable to--and often exceeding--those of commercial systems (ChatGPT-5-thinking/o3/o4-mini-high Deep Research) at a substantially lower cost, while enabling on-prem integration with local data and tools.

Abstract: General solutions of a gravitational junction between two copies of a three-dimensional Einstein manifold $\mathcal{M}$ correspond to the solutions of the non-linear Nambu-Goto equation for a string in $\mathcal{M}$. We show that, for the junctions in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetimes constituted by tensile strings, which are dual to interfaces between thermal states in conformal field theories, the solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation describing the junction correspond to state-dependent wave-packets, which are perfectly reflected at the interface to future null infinity without shape distortion when incident from past null infinity. These wavepackets are realized by state-dependent half-sided conformal transformations and affect the expectation value of the displacement operator. We further show that the entanglement entropy of an interval straddling the interface deciphers the stringy modes of the dual junction even in the tensionless limit. We also demonstrate that the strong sub-additivity of entanglement entropy is satisfied and is saturated for symmetric intervals generally.

Abstract: We introduce a holographic framework for analyzing the steady states of repeated quantum channels with strong symmetries. Using channel-state duality, we show that the steady state of a $d$-dimensional quantum channel is holographically mapped to the boundary reduced density matrix of a $(d+1)$-dimensional wavefunction generated by a sequential unitary circuit. From this perspective, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in the steady state arises from the anyon condensation on the boundary of a topological order in one higher dimension. The conditional mutual information (CMI) associated with SWSSB is then inherited from the bulk topological entanglement entropy. We make this duality explicit using isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) by identifying the channel's time evolution with the transfer matrix of a higher-dimensional isoTNS. Built on isoTNS, we further construct continuously tunable quantum channels that exhibit distinct mixed-state phases and transitions in the steady states.

arXiv:2511.19612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether sequential unitary circuits can prepare two-dimensional chiral states, using a correspondence between sequentially prepared states, isometric tensor network states, and one-dimensional quantum channel circuits. We establish two no-go theorems, one for Gaussian fermion systems and one for generic interacting systems. In Gaussian fermion systems, the correspondence relates the defining features of chiral wave functions in their entanglement spectrum to the algebraic decaying correlations in the steady state of channel dynamics. We establish the no-go theorem by proving that local channel dynamics with translational invariance cannot support such correlations. As a direct implication, two-dimensional Gaussian fermion isometric tensor network states cannot support algebraically decaying correlations in all directions or represent a chiral state. In generic interacting systems, we establish a no-go theorem by showing that the state prepared by sequential circuits cannot host the tripartite entanglement of a chiral state due to the constraints from causality.

arXiv:2511.19662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed reservoirs provide a powerful means of engineering nonclassical noise and controlling irreversible dynamics in open quantum systems. Here we develop a comprehensive analysis of two coupled harmonic oscillators driven by independent squeezed baths, focusing on the emergence of coherence-driven entropy flow and the structure of exceptional points (EPs) in the corresponding Lindblad dynamics. Working entirely within the Gaussian formalism, we derive closed-form evolution equations for the covariance matrix and show that squeezing induces entropy generation only at *second order* in the anomalous correlations, a nonlinear mechanism absent in thermal environments. This entropy flow is accompanied by a rich non-Hermitian structure: by scanning the squeezing parameters we uncover a characteristic "exceptional-point fan" in the (M1, M2) plane, which separates a narrow PT-unbroken region of oscillatory dynamics from broad PT-broken sectors in which one normal mode becomes purely overdamped. This geometric organization of EPs reveals that PT symmetry survives only when the two reservoirs squeeze opposite quadratures, and is generically broken for in-phase squeezing. Our analysis establishes squeezed reservoirs as a natural setting where information-bearing noise drives irreversible behavior through coherent pathways, and lays the groundwork for experimentally accessible probes of entropy flow and critical mode behavior in more complex open systems.

Abstract: We develop an approach for understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems by analyzing individual quantum trajectories in the eigenbasis of the Liouvillian superoperator. From trajectory-eigenstate overlaps, we construct a quasiprobability distribution that characterizes the degree of localization of the trajectories in the Liouvillian eigenbasis. Contrary to the common wisdom that late-time dynamics are governed solely by the steady state and the slowest-decaying modes, we show that trajectories can remain well spread over transient eigenstates deep within the bulk of the Liouvillian spectrum even at late times. We demonstrate this explicitly using numerical simulations of interacting spin chains and bosonic systems. Moreover, we find that the delocalization of the trajectory strongly correlates with the purity of the trajectory-averaged steady state, establishing a further link between the trajectory and ensemble pictures of open quantum dynamics.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) accelerates scientific discovery by prioritizing the most informative experiments, but traditional machine learning (ML) models used in AL suffer from cold-start limitations and domain-specific feature engineering, restricting their generalizability. Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven autonomous discovery.

arXiv:2511.19793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau paradigm is a central dogma for understanding phase and phase transitions in condensed matter systems, yet for decades it has been known that a variety of quantum phases exist beyond the framework. Is there a more general framework that provides a systematic understanding of phase and phase transitions in quantum many-body systems? Recent developments of the notion of generalized symmetry and generalized gauging seem to point to a way to generalize the Landau Paradigm. In this essay, we discuss how `beyond Landau' phases and phase transitions can be captured by a generalized Landau paradigm in terms of the breaking of generalized symmetries, often induced by the generalized gauging procedure facilitated through the topological holography formalism. We also discuss what needs to be understood to make the generalized Landau paradigm useful in the study of quantum phase and phase transitions.

Abstract: Evacuating the powder trapped inside the complex cavities of Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures remains a major challenge in metal-powder-based additive manufacturing. The Discrete Element Method offers valuable insights into this evacuation process, enabling the design of effective de-powdering strategies. In this study, we simulate gravity-driven evacuation of trapped powders from inside unit cells of various TPMS structures. We systematically investigate the role of cohesive energy density in shaping the discharge profile. Overall, we conclude that the Schwarz-P and Gyroid topologies enable the most efficient powder evacuation, remaining resilient to cohesion-induced flow hindrance. Furthermore, for the two unit cells, we analyse detailed kinematics and interpret the results in relation to particle overlaps and contact force distributions.

Abstract: A numerical model is proposed to simulate the adhesion, compression, and subsequent detachment of a micro-liter droplet from a superhydrophobic surface composed of chemically homogeneous pillars arranged in a periodic fashion, replicating a typical force probe microscopy experiment. We observe that as the droplet is pulled away from the surface, the net vertical force varies in a typical sawtooth manner with peculiar peaks and troughs, characteristic of the surface. The force first reaches a maximum before the droplet detaches from the surface with a comparatively lower force. The force variation predicted by the numerical model is in good agreement with the experimental results of Kumar et al. [1]. We also studied the effect of evaporation on the variation in the adhesion force by simulating an evaporating droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. For an evaporating droplet, the numerically predicted maximum and detachment force magnitudes are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally when we take into account the change in the droplet weight as it evaporates. The proposed method will be useful for the quantitative analysis and design of a variety of superhydrophobic surfaces and will pave the way for more accurate surface characterization based on droplet adhesion force measurements.

Abstract: Understanding contact line dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces with microscopic structures is essential for designing materials with reduced drag, anti-icing, self-cleaning, and anti-fouling properties. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that forces on droplets receding over structured surfaces are governed by microscale deformations near the contact line. We present and experimentally validate an expression demonstrating that adhesion force increases logarithmically with pillar area fraction at constant droplet volume and pillar surface chemistry. Furthermore, we establish that the average tensile force measured in direct force measurements provides a more reliable indicator of surface structure than the commonly used maximum force. This newfound insight enables precise quantification of superhydrophobic surface structure using a droplet probe.

arXiv:2511.20166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In wavefront shaping, waves are focused through complex media onto one or more target points, and the resulting intensity enhancement is quantified by the enhancement factor. While reproducible enhancement is crucial in experiments, the fluctuations of the enhancement factor remain largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments, simulations, and exact analytical results using random matrix theory to determine its full distribution in multi-point focusing. Our theoretical framework goes beyond the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur law-valid only in the limit of a large number of channels-by accurately predicting the mean enhancement in finite-channel experiments and its fluctuations whenever long-range mesoscopic correlations are negligible (e.g., in weakly scattering media or under limited wavefront control). Notably, in the strongly scattering regime, experiments and simulations reveal giant fluctuations in the enhancement factor, which we attribute directly to long-range mesoscopic correlations. From a fundamental perspective, our results provide a direct method for quantifying long-range correlations in wavefront-shaping-based focusing, even with a limited number of input control channels. On the applied side, they enable the accurate prediction of the enhancement factor and a lower bound on its fluctuations, which are crucial for biomedical imaging, optical metrology, optical trapping, and communication through scattering media.

Abstract: This paper describes the problem of drift of solid non-interacting particles in a microchannel, which can stick to its walls under the action of the van der Waals forces and break away from the wall due to thermal noise and viscous stresses arising from the flow. The pressure drop is given between the channel inlet and outlet. At the initial moment of time, the channel walls are contaminated with adhered particles, i.e. the walls are uneven, which affects the formation of the flow structure through the channel. Over time, under the action of viscous stresses and thermal noise, the particles break away from the channel walls, causing its cleaning. The interaction of the detached particles with the flow is taken into account in the Stokes approximation. In addition, the model takes into account random particle motion caused by diffusion. The problem is solved numerically within the framework of the random walk model. The evolution of the liquid flow in the channel during its cleaning is obtained: stream function, pressure, and vorticity fields. The dependencies of the volume occupied by settled particles, the flow rate through the channel and the channel gap on time are determined for different values of the interaction force between particles and channel wall. The estimations of the channel cleaning time are obtained and discussed. The possibility of control the cleaning process by the modulation of liquid flux through the channel is investigated. It is shown that resonance phenomena can be observed. The dependencies of cleaning time on the modulation amplitude and frequency is obtained and studied. It is shown that changing the modulation parameters leads to a significant change in the cleaning time and helps control the cleaning process.

By collecting both experimental data from a quantum processing unit (QPU) in analog mode and numerical benchmarks, we enable accurate predictions of run-time and energy consumption for large-scale simulations on both QPUs and classical systems through fitting of theoretical scaling laws. Our analysis shows that neutral atom devices are already operating in a competitive regime, achieving comparable or superior performance to classical approaches while consuming significantly less energy. These results demonstrate the potential of analog neutral atom quantum computing for energy-efficient simulation and highlight a viable path toward sustainable computational strategies.

Abstract: We investigate a new quantum sensor for dark matter direct detection with sub-eV sensitivity, focusing on several candidate materials that potentially host chiral phonons with large magnetic moments that can be directly read out with an external magnetometer. We focus on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as possible candidate materials for single chiral phonon detection due to their noncentrosymmetric structure, tunability, and the ability to host these excitations in stable acoustic bands. We identify several promising candidates and compare their projected dark matter detection sensitivity for all possible interactions identified within effective field theory. We establish that the expected sensitivity does not depend heavily on the specific choice of the MOF, enabling us to tailor the final material composition to facilitate the magnetic readout. We then propose a prototype setup able to test the direct readout of a chiral phonon sensor with a surface-integrated magnetometer.

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) -- the anomalous boundary accumulation of an extensive number of bulk modes -- has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with broad implications for transport, sensing, and topological classification. A central open question is how magnetic or synthetic gauge fields influence this boundary phenomenon. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for magnetic control of the NHSE along line boundaries in two-dimensional single-band lattices. Using a non-Hermitian extension of the anisotropic Harper--Hofstadter model as a representative example, we show that magnetic fields suppress the geometric skin effect in reciprocal models, whereas skin localization can persist in nonreciprocal systems. The analysis disentangles the interplay of flux, nonreciprocity, and boundary geometry, revealing that magnetic fields mitigate or suppress the NHSE through distinct physical mechanisms -- such as bulk localization via Landau or Anderson physics, or the restoration of effective reciprocity. In particular, the geometry-dependent skin effect in reciprocal systems is found to be fragile against even weak magnetic fields.

Abstract: At the beginning of the 70's, Baxter introduced a multiparametric generalization of the six-vertex model. This integrable system has been found to exhibit a remarkable variety of critical behaviors. The work is part of a series of papers devoted to their systematic study. We focus on the case when the lattice model possesses an additional ${\cal Z}_r$ symmetry and consider the critical behavior near the so-called free fermion point. Among other things, discussed is the algebra of extended conformal symmetry underlying the universal behavior. The main result of the paper is the class of differential equations that describe the scaling limit of the solutions to the Bethe Ansatz equations. This is an instance of the correspondence between Ordinary Differential Equations and Integrable Quantum Field Theory (ODE/IQFT correspondence).

arXiv:2511.20619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a tensor network state, how can we determine conserved operators (including Hamiltonians) for which the state is an eigenstate? We answer this question by presenting a method to extract geometrically $k$-local conserved operators that have the given infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) in 2D as an (approximate) eigenstate. The key ingredient is the evaluation of the static structure factors of multi-site operators through differentiating the generating function. Despite the approximation errors, we show that our method is still able to extract from exact or variational iPEPS to good precision both frustration-free and non-frustration-free parent Hamiltonians that are beyond the standard construction and obtain better locality. In particular, we find a 4-site-plaquette local Hamiltonian that approximately has the short-range RVB state as the ground state. Moreover, we find a Hamiltonian that has the deformed toric code state at any string tension as excited eigenstates at the same energy, which might be potential candidates for quantum many-body scars.

Abstract: Application of a strong electric field to insulators induces a finite current. This phenomenon is called dielectric breakdown and is known as a fundamental nonequilibrium and nonlinear transport phenomenon in solids. Here, we study the dielectric breakdown of generic strongly correlated insulators in one dimension. Combining bosonization techniques with a quantum tunneling theory, we develop an effective field-theoretical description of dielectric breakdown using a non-Hermitian sine-Gordon theory. Then, we derive an analytic formula for the threshold field, which is a many-body generalization of the Landau-Zener formula. Importantly, we point out that the threshold field contains a previously overlooked factor originating from the charges of elementary excitations, which should be significant when a system has fractionalized excitations. We apply our results to integrable lattice models and confirm that our formula is valid in a broad range including the weak coupling regime, indicating its wide potential applicability. Our results unveil universal aspects of nonlinear and nonequilibrium transport phenomena in various strongly correlated insulators.

arXiv:2111.03857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetism in tilted fermionic Mott insulators. With a small tilt, the fermions are still localized and form a Mott-insulating state, where the localized spins interact via antiferromagnetic exchange coupling. While the localized state is naively expected to be broken with a large tilt, in fact, the fermions are still localized under a large tilt due to the Wannier-Stark localization and it can be regarded as a localized spin system. We find that the sign of the exchange coupling is changed and the ferromagnetic interaction is realized under the large tilt. To show this, we employ perturbation theory and real-time numerical simulation of the fermionic Hubbard chain. Our simulation exhibits that it is possible to effectively control the speed and time direction of the dynamics by changing the size of the tilt, which may be useful for experimentally measuring out-of-time-ordered correlators. Finally, we discuss experimental platforms, such as ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, to observe these phenomena.

Abstract: We discuss (1+1)d gapless phases with non-invertible global symmetries, also referred to as categorical symmetries. This includes gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, known as gapless SPT (or gSPT) phases; and gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped spontaneous symmetry broken (SSB) phases, that we refer to as gapless SSB (or gSSB) phases. We fit these gapless phases, along with gapped SPT and SSB phases, into a phase diagram describing possible deformations connecting them. This phase diagram is partially ordered and defines a so-called Hasse diagram. Based on these deformations, we identify gapless phases exhibiting symmetry protected criticality, that we refer to as intrinsically gapless SPT (igSPT) and intrinsically gapless SSB (igSSB) phases. This includes the first examples of igSPT and igSSB phases with non-invertible symmetries. Central to this analysis is the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where each phase corresponds to a condensable algebra in the Drinfeld center of the symmetry category. On a mathematical note, gSPT phases are classified by functors between fusion categories, generalizing the fact that gapped SPT phases are classified by fiber functors; and gSSB phases are classified by functors from fusion to multi-fusion categories. Finally, our framework can be applied to understand gauging of trivially acting non-invertible symmetries, including possible patterns of decomposition arising due to such gaugings.

Abstract: We devise an ideal 3-dimensional octagonal quasicrystal that is based upon the 2-dimensional Ammann-Beenker tiling and that is potentially suitable for realization with patchy particles. Based on an analysis of its local environments we design a binary system of 8- and 5-patch particles that in simulations assembles into a 3-dimensional octagonal quasicrystal. The local structure is subtly different from the original ideal quasicrystal possessing a narrower coordination-number distribution; in fact, the 8-patch particles are not needed and a one-component system of the 5-patch particles assembles into an essentially identical octagonal quasicrystal. We also consider a one-component system of the 8-patch particles; this assembles into a cluster with a number of crystalline domains, but which, because of the coherent boundaries between the crystallites, has approximate eight-fold order. We envisage that these systems could be realized using DNA origami or protein design.

Abstract: Magnetic monopole quasiparticles in spin ice materials hold the potential for exploring new frontiers of physics that extend beyond Maxwell's equations. We have previously proposed a two-dimensional magnetic monopole gas (2DMG), confined at the interface between spin-ice ($R_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, $R$ = Dy, Ho) and antiferromagnetic iridate ($R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, $R$ = Dy, Ho), which hosts monopoles with a net charge. The mechanism behind the 2D confinement of the monopole gas remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that entropy is a key factor in the 2D confinement of this monopole gas. We reveal that the competition between the entropy of spin-ice, which favors the 2D confinement, and the entropy of the monopoles' random walks, which favors the deconfinement, dictates the distribution of the monopoles within a few layers close to the interface. Our entropy-based model accurately reproduces the monopole distribution obtained from the spin model, affirming that 2D confinement is entropy-driven. We further employ both models to show that the monopole distribution can be manipulated by an external magnetic field and temperature, holding promise for next-generation devices based on magnetic monopoles. Our findings reveal the entropic mechanisms in 2DMG, enabling the manipulation of emergent quasiparticles at material interfaces.

Abstract: We theoretically explore how light-driven optical phonons can be used to drive magnetic exchange interactions into interesting physical regimes by developing a general theory of spin-phonon pumping in magnetic insulators with non-equilibrium optical phonon distributions, focusing on the diabatic regime where phonon frequencies are much larger than the magnetic interactions. We present several applications of spin-phonon pumping two-dimensional nearest-neighbor Heisenberg, XYZ and Kitaev models to examine what kind of further neighbor interactions and chiral fields can be generated, and how anisotropic couplings can be enhanced, showing that experimentally accessible non-equilibrium phonon distributions can generically drive significant frustration and realize a variety of spin liquid regimes. This effect is described for both direct and superexchange mechanisms, and we derive simple geometric rules for which phonon modes are ``spin-phonon'' active and for which magnetic interactions. Spin-phonon pumping provides an intriguing possibility for preferentially pumping specific magnetic interaction terms. In addition to generating further neighbor interactions, such pumping can lead to increased magnetic anisotropy for initially weakly anisotropic models, and selectively pumping the Kitaev-Heisenberg model can suppress undesirable Heisenberg terms while enhancing Kitaev interactions.

Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.

Abstract: Searching for ambient-pressure conventional superconductors with critical temperatures (TC) higher than 40 K is a key challenge in the field of high-temperature superconductivity, mainly due to lack of efficient and effective models to estimate TC of potential systems. In this work, we propose a simplified model to estimate the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling (EPC) strength {\lambda} by separately treating the EPC matrix elements which evaluate the pairing strength and the phonon-assisted nesting function P({\omega}) which evaluates the matching of electron bands and phonon spectra for forming potential electron pairs via phonons. Our model illuminates the critical role of P({\omega}) and its spectral integral P in determining {\lambda}, i.e., high P is a necessary condition leading to large {\lambda} and thus high TC, which is further demonstrated by showing that the reported high-TC traditional superconductors in literatures all have high P. As an easily quantifiable parameter, P({\omega}) and P provide an efficient and effective descriptor for accelerating the discovery and rational design of high-TC superconductors. By applying the model to screen over the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), we successfully identify several high-TC superconducting systems as confirmed by accurate first-principles calculations. Our model opens new avenues for exploring high-TC systems.

Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.

Abstract: We analytically investigate the dynamic behavior of an an-isotropic active Brownian particle under various stochastic resetting protocols in two dimensions. The motion of shape-asymmetric active Brownian particles in two dimensions leads to an-isotropic diffusion at short times, whereas rotational diffusion causes the transport to become isotropic at longer times. We have considered three different resetting protocols: (a) complete resetting, when both position and orientation are reset to their initial states, (b) only position is reset to its initial state, (c) only orientation is reset to its initial state. We reveal that orientation resetting sustains asymmetry even at late times. When both the spatial position and orientation are subject to resetting, a complex position probability distribution forms in the steady state. All the analytical findings are thoroughly validated by corresponding simulation results.

Abstract: We compute the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity of a Fermi gas with short-range interactions in the Fermi liquid regime of the normal phase, that is at temperatures $T$ much lower than the Fermi temperature $T_{\rm F}$ and much larger than the superfluid critical temperature $T_c$. Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation-time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\rm F}$, follow $(1+\gamma k_{\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $\gamma$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity.

Abstract: The recent discovery of altermagnetism has sparked renewed interest in the growth of epitaxial films of the NiAs-phase polymorph of CrSb. This paper describes the magnetron sputtering-based fabrication and characterization of high-quality single crystalline CrSb(0001) thin films supported by an isostructural nonmagnetic PtSb buffer. X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy show that the films are phase pure and possess a very high crystalline quality (mosaicity ~0.05deg), while also being free of extended crystallographic defects. Both scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy confirm their smooth and homogeneous topography. Additionally, the elemental composition of our films was found to be close to stoichiometric via electron probe microanalysis and x-ray fluorescence. Thus, the developed samples represent an ideal platform for further investigation of the material properties of CrSb.

Abstract: High-harmonic generation in solids by intense laser pulses provides a fascinating platform for studying material properties and ultra-fast electron dynamics, where its coherent character is a central aspect. Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we uncover a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs. inter-band contributions. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space in gapped systems with both linear dispersion, such as for massive Dirac Fermions, and with quadratic dispersion, as e.g. for bilayer graphene. Moreover, we demonstrate that, upon increasing dephasing, destructive interference between intra- and inter-band contributions is lifted. This leads to reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics, i.e. a crossover from the characteristic spectral "shoulder" to a slowly decaying signal involving much higher harmonics. We supplement our numerical observations with analytical results for the one-dimensional case.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating the failure of reinforced elastomers has been a long-standing challenge in many industrial applications. In an early attempt to shed light on the fundamental mechanisms of failure, Gent and Park presented a systematic experimental study examining the field that develops near rigid beads that are embedded in the material and describe two distinct failure phenomena: cavitation that occurs near the bead in the bulk of the material, and debonding at the bead--rubber interface [Gent, A.N. and Park, B., 1984. Journal of Materials Science, 19, pp.1947-1956]. Although the interpretation of their results has not been challenged, several questions stemming from their work remain unresolved. Specifically, the reported dependence of the cavitation stress on the diameter of the bead and the counterintuitive relationship between the delamination threshold and the material stiffness. In this work, we revisit the work of Gent and Park and consider an alternative explanation of their observations, interfacial cavitation. A numerically validated semi-analytical model shows that in {the} presence of surface tension, defects at the bead-rubber interface may be prone to cavitate at lower pressures compared to bulk cavitation, and that surface tension can explain the reported length-scale effects. A phase-map portrays the distinct regions of `cavitation dominated' and `delamination dominated' failure and confirms that for the expected range of material properties of the rubbers used by Gent and Park, interfacial cavitation is a likely explanation. Crucially, this result offers a new avenue to tune and optimize the performance of reinforced polymers and other multi-material systems.

Abstract: We design a thermal bath that preserves the conservation of a system's angular momentum or allows it to fluctuate around a specified nonzero mean while maintaining a Boltzmann distribution of energy in the steady state. We demonstrate that classical particles immersed in such baths exhibit position-momentum uncertainties with a strictly positive lower bound proportional to the absolute value of the mean angular momentum. The proportionality constant, $c$, is dimensionless and does not depend explicitly on the system's parameters. Remarkably, while $c$ is universally bounded by unity, it attains the exact value $c=1/2$ for particles in central potentials.

Abstract: Coherent terahertz (THz) emission is emerging as a powerful new tool to probe symmetry breakings in quantum materials. This method relies on second order optical nonlinearities and is complementary to second harmonic generation spectroscopy. Here, we report coherent THz emission from Josephson plasmons in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, and find that the amplitude of the emitted field increases dramatically close to the superconducting transition temperature, $T_C$. We show theoretically how emission is enhanced by critical superconducting fluctuations, a nonlinear analogue of critical opalescence. This observation is expected to be of general importance for the study of many thermal and quantum phase transitions.

Abstract: We demonstrate that dissipative state preparation protocols in many-body systems can be substantially accelerated via the quantum Mpemba effect. Our approach exploits weak symmetries to analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. In particular, we study the preparation of a lattice Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of a dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.

Abstract: Using functional methods, we investigate the sound quanta arising from quantized hydrodynamic fields in simple liquids at low temperatures, under the influence of high-energy processes, coming from non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom. To model these effects on the hydrodynamic fields, we assume that the quantum fields are coupled to an additive, delta-correlated (in space and time) quantum noise field. Thus, the hydrodynamic fields are defined in a fluctuating environment. After defining the generating functional of connected correlation functions in the presence of the noise field, we perform a functional integral over all noise field configurations. This is done using a formal object inspired by the distributional zeta-function method, called the configurational zeta-function. We obtain a new generating functional written in terms of an analytically tractable functional series. This formalism allow us to obtain the excitation spectra of liquids. In the liquid, each term of the series describes the emergent non-interacting elementary excitations with the usual phonon-like dispersion relation and additional excitations with dispersion relations with gaps in pseudo-momentum space. Finally, the behavior of the constant volume specific heat as a function of temperature is obtained for different simple liquids.

Abstract: We establish a theoretical formulation of the orbital magnetic moment in multiorbital tight-binding models, focusing on the role of the electric dipole. We demonstrate that the total magnetic moment can be decomposed into several contributions in multiorbital tight-binding models generally. In particular, we reveal that the electric dipole moment of Wannier orbitals also contributes to the orbital magnetic moment, which is not included in the conventional expression for the orbital magnetic moment in lattice systems. The derived formulation for the magnetic moment is applied to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), a phenomenon where circularly-polarized light induces a magnetic moment. To account for all possible contributions, we adopt an $s$-$p$ tight-binding system as a minimal model for studying the IFE. Using an analytical approach based on the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we clarify the physical origins of these contributions. Additionally, we quantitatively evaluate each contribution on an equal footing through a numerical approach based on the Floquet formalism. Our results reveal that the orbital magnetic moment exhibits a significantly larger response compared to the spin magnetic moment, with all contributions to the orbital magnetic moment being comparable in magnitude. These findings highlight the essential role of orbital degrees of freedom in the IFE.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the generation and Josephson current signatures of Floquet Majorana end modes (FMEMs) in a periodically driven altermagnet (AM) heterostructure. Considering a one-dimensional (1D) Rashba nanowire (RNW) proximitized to a regular $s$-wave superconductor and a $d$-wave AM, we generate both $0$- and $\pi$-FMEMs by driving the nontopological phase of the static system. While the static counterpart hosts both topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and nontopological accidental zero modes (AZMs), the drive can gap out the static AZMs and generate robust $\pi$-FMEMs, termed as topological AZMs (TAZMs). We topologically characterize the emergent FMEMs via dynamical winding numbers exploiting chiral symmetry of the system. Moreover, we consider a periodically driven Josephson junction comprising of RNW/AM-based 1D topological superconduting setup. We identify the signature of MZMs and FMEMs utilizing $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect, distinguishing them from trivial AZMs exhibiting $2\pi$-periodicty, in both static and driven platforms. This Josephson current signal due to Majorana modes survives even in presence of finite disorder. Our work establishes a route to realize and identify FMEMs in AM-based platforms through Floquet engineering and Josephson current response.

Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the effect of Anti-site Disorder (ASD) on electrical resistivity $\rho(T)$ and transverse magnetoresistance $MR_{\perp}$ in off-stoichiometric Co-Fe-Ti-Si (CFTS) thin films across the thermo-elastic martensitic phase transformation (MPT). The CFTS films with A2 ASD exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (n-TCR) and an upturn below $\sim 30\,$K. In sharp contrast, the partially L2$_1$-ordered films are metallic in nature, characterized by a resistivity minimum at low temperatures ($T_{\min} \cong 30\,$K) and a positive TCR for $T > T_{\min}$. The change in the sign of TCR finds a straightforward explanation in terms of the competition between the quantum corrections (weak localization, electron--diffuson scattering) and the ballistic scattering mechanisms (electron--magnon and electron--phonon). We find that, stronger the atomic ASD, more prominent the quantum corrections and the weaker the scattering of $e-m$ and $e-p$ scattering. All the CFTS films exhibit a distinct thermal hysteresis and a significant drop in resistivity, symptomatic of a MPT, near the characteristic temperatures: martensite-end $T_{Me} \cong 300\,$K and austenite-begin $T_{\mathrm{Ab}} \cong 325\,$K. Regardless of the strength of ASD, in the martensite phase the anti-symmetric (ASMR) component of $\mathrm{MR}_{\perp}(H)$ dominates over the symmetric (SMR) counterpart, whereas the reverse is true (i.e. SMR $\gg$ ASMR) for the austenite phase at temperatures $T_{\mathrm{Ab}} \cong 325\,$K $\le T \le 375\,$K, where $\mathrm{MR}_{\perp}$ increases very sharply with temperature as the austenite phase grows rapidly at the expense of the martensite phase. The present results assert that the CFTS Heusler alloy thin films are promising candidates for shape-memory devices and for spintronic applications such as spin valves.

Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunneling that decays as a power law with distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for continuous tuning of both the dimerization pattern and the disorder strength. Within the parameter space constrained by our geometry, we show that both mechanisms lead to a localized phase that does not resemble standard MBL. This phase can be understood as an ensemble of distinct Hilbert space fragmented realizations induced by small inter-spin separations. As dimerization is commonly associated with Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) physics, we also examine the SPT states across the entire energy spectrum. Despite a partial spin-glass order, we argue that the system hosts an extensive fraction of SPT states.

Abstract: We define and study a statistical mechanics ensemble that characterizes connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Built around a well-known local entropy bias, it allows us to better identify hardness transitions in problems where the energy landscape is dominated by isolated solutions. We apply this new device to the symmetric binary perceptron model (SBP), and study how its manifold of connected solutions behaves. We choose this particular problem because, while its typical solutions are isolated, it can be solved using local algorithms for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. With this new ensemble, we unveil the presence of a cluster composed of delocalized connected solutions. In particular, we demonstrate its stability until a critical threshold $\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$ (dependent on $\alpha$). This transition appears as paths of solutions shatter, a phenomenon that more conventional statistical mechanics approaches fail to grasp. Finally, we compared our predictions to simulations. For this, we used a modified Monte-Carlo algorithm, designed specifically to target these delocalized solutions. We obtained, as predicted, that the algorithm finds solutions until $\kappa\approx\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$.

Abstract: Recent experiments reported evidence of superconductivity and re-entrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) insulator upon doping the $\nu_e = 2/3$ fractional quantum anomalous Hall states (FQAH) in twisted MoTe${}_2$, separated by narrow resistive regions. Anyons of a FQAH generally have a finite effective mass, and when described by anyon-flux composite fermions (CF), experience statistical magnetic fields with a commensurate filling. Here, we show that most of the experimental observations can be explained by invoking the effects of disorder on the Landau-Hofstadter bands of CFs. In particular, by making minimal assumptions about the anyon energetics and dispersion, we show that doping anyons drives plateau transitions of CFs into integer quantum Hall states, which physically corresponds to either to a superconductor or to a RIQAH phase. We develop a dictionary that allows us to infer the response in these phases and the critical regions from the knowledge of the response functions of the plateau transitions. In particular, this allows us to relate the superfluid stiffness of the superconductor to the polarizability of CFs. As a first step towards a quantitative understanding, we borrow results from the celebrated integer quantum Hall plateau transitions to make quantitative prediction for the critical behavior of the superfluid stiffness, longitudinal and Hall conductivity, and response to out-of-plane magnetic field, all of which agree reasonably well with the experimental observations. Our results provide strong support for anyon superconductivity being the mechanism for the observed superconductor in the vicinity of the $\nu_e = 2/3$ FQAH insulator.

Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region, e.g., InAs on a (001)-oriented GaAs substrate, can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.

This phase hosts antichiral edge states of co-propagating Majorana fermions and are spatially localized at the opposite edges of the sample, perpendicular to the magnetic field. We discuss the characteristic signatures in the current-phase relation of a Josephson junction formed by two reservoirs in the topological phase.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\Gamma$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\Gamma$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.

Abstract: We unravel the existence and nonequilibrium response of one-dimensional harmonically trapped droplet configurations in the presence of a central potential barrier or well. For fixed negative chemical potentials, it is shown that droplets fragment into two for increasing potential barrier heights, a process that occurs faster for larger widths. However, atoms from the droplet accumulate at the potential well, especially for wider ones, leading to a deformed droplet and eventually to the termination of the solution. Linearization analysis yields the underlying excitation spectrum which dictates stability and the behavior of the ensuing collective modes. Quenches in the potential height are used to demonstrate dynamical fragmentation of the droplet for potential barriers as well as self-evaporation along with droplet localization and eventual relaxation for longer evolution times in the case of potential wells. The presence of selective excitation processes emanating from quantum superposition in the induced droplet dynamics is explicated by evaluating the contribution of the participating single-particle eigenstates. Our results should be detectable by current ultracold atom experiments and may inspire engineered droplet dynamics with the aid of external potentials.

Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit high carrier mobility and tunability, making them suitable for low-power, high-performance electronic and spintronic applications. Incorporating narrow-band electronic correlation effects could further promote tunability, though mass renormalization may impact carrier mobility. It is therefore challenging to identify a vdW material with both high mobility and strong correlation. Herein, by a combination of optical spectroscopy and high-field quantum-oscillation measurements, we observe significant effective-mass enhancement in CeTe$_3$ at low temperature, arising from not only the band-structure modulation by antiferromagnetic ordering but also the narrow-band correlation effect. Despite the mass enhancement, the quantum mobility surprisingly \textit{increases} and reaches $\sim$2403 cm$^2$/Vs, likely benefiting from topological protection. Remarkably, these unique properties are maintained in atomically thin nanoflakes with quantum mobility enhanced to $\sim$3158 cm$^2$/Vs. Thus, CeTe$_3$ emerges as a promising Kondo-coupled vdW antiferromagnetic metal with high-mobility quasiparticles, potentially unlocking new device concepts.

Abstract: The local magnetic moments of atoms in a molecule or solid can be designated by different colors. Magnetic groups, or 2-color groups, or black-and-white groups have been applied in crystallography to classify different magnets. Despite its successes in the past decades, the recent advents of altermagnets and p-wave magnets raise new challenges to this long-standing framework, which urges for a new and unified one. Here we develop a multicolor group classification framework to classify all kinds of molecules and solids, including nonmagnetic materials and magnets with collinear or non-collinear magnetism, and with or without spin-orbit couplings (SOC). This new scheme can unify the classifications of matters into a single framework, including the recently identified altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Especially, altermagnetic topological matters and p-wave magnets with SOC, can also be diagnosed with multicolor groups, a task which can not be accomplished by magnetic space groups and spin space groups. Moreover, insufficiencies and misconceptions of conventional magnetic group classification can be supplemented through this new framework. Multicolor group will serve as a new stage in the symmetry classification of matters.

Abstract: The search for superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry has been a central focus in the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In this work, we report a numerically exact study of the spin-triplet pairing in a two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, employing Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method. The model includes next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms, and maintains spin balance. By tuning the fermion filling close to a type-II van Hove singularity (vHs) in the model, we numerically investigate the ordering tendencies of several possible pairing channels with different symmetries. Our numerical results provide clear evidence for the spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing instability approaching low temperatures, as revealed by the vertex contribution to the pairing susceptibility. This signature becomes increasingly pronounced as the interaction strength increases in the weak to intermediate regime. We further find that, near the type-II vHs, the dominant spin-spin correlations in the system are ferromagnetic, suggesting its close relation to the spin-triplet pairing instability. Our findings offer a reliable approach to realize the spin-triplet $p$-wave superfluidity in the repulsive Hubbard model, from an unbiased numerical perspective.

Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.

Abstract: Two-dimensional multiferroics promise low-power, multifunctional devices, yet the intrinsic coexistence and mutual control of three coupled ferroic orders in a single layer remains elusive. Here, we identify pentagonal monolayer FeO$_2$ as an intrinsic triferroic altermagnet where ferroelectric (FE), ferroelastic (FA), and altermagnetic (AM) orders coexist and are tightly coupled, accompanied by a competing antiferroelectric (AFE) phase using first-principles calculations. The sole presence of glide mirror $M_x$ symmetry in a FeO$_2$ sublayer, with the breaking of four-fold rotation $C_{4z}$ symmetry, induces in-plane vector ferroelectricity and twin-related ferroelastic strains. Both FE and AFE phases break combined parity - time symmetry and display sizable altermagnetic spin splitting with N\'eel temperatures over 200~K. Electric-field-induced rotation of the FE polarization reverses the sign of the spin splitting, while in-plane uniaxial strain triggers ferroelastic switching that simultaneously rotates the FE polarization vector by $90^\circ$ and reverses the AM state. These electric-field- and strain-mediated pathways interlink six distinct polarization states that can be selected purely by electric fields and/or mechanical strain. This work extends intrinsic triferroicity to pentagonal monolayers and outlines a symmetry-based route toward mechanically and electrically configurable altermagnetic spintronics.

Abstract: We provide a framework for optimizing energy conversion processes in coherent quantum conductors fed by nonthermal resources. Such nonthermal resources, which cannot be characterized by temperatures or electrochemical potentials, occur in small-scale systems that are smaller than their thermalization length. Using scattering theory in combination with a Lagrange multiplier method, we optimize the device's performance based on the efficiency, precision, or a trade-off between the two at a given output current. The transmission properties leading to this optimal performance are identified. We showcase our findings with the example of a refrigerator exploiting experimentally relevant nonthermal resources, which could result from competing environments or from light irradiation. We show that the performance is improved compared to a device exploiting a thermal resource. Our results can serve as guidelines for the design of energy-conversion processes in future nanoelectronic devices.

Abstract: We study charge and spin transport across a junction between an altermagnet (AM) and a $p$-wave magnet (PM) using a continuum model with boundary conditions tailored to the spin-split band structures of the two materials. Remarkably, although neither AM nor PM is spin-polarized, we find that the junction supports finite spin currents both longitudinally and transversely. We compute the longitudinal and transverse charge and spin conductivities as functions of the crystallographic orientations and the relative angle between the N\'eel vectors of AM and PM. Our results reveal that transverse charge and spin conductivities can be finite even when the longitudinal charge conductivity vanishes. For suitable parameter choices and orientation angles, the transverse conductivities are more prominent than the longitudinal ones. The origin of these effects lies in the matching and mismatching of transverse momentum modes ($k_y$) across the junction combined with the spin-dependent band splitting in AM and PM. Furthermore, while the transverse charge conductivity may be zero for certain orientations, the transverse spin conductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite $k_y$ channels. These findings highlight AM-PM junctions as a promising platform for tunable generation and control of transverse charge and spin currents driven purely by crystallographic orientation and spin structure.

Abstract: Spin orbit torques (SOT) are used to manipulate magnetization of ferromagnets in heavy metal / ferromagnetic bilayers and thus are technologically relevant from magnetization switching perspective. This necessitates development of methods which give an insight into SOT behaviour and enable SOT efficiency estimation. In this article, we demonstrate an experimental approach of out-of-plane (OOP) angle resolved Second Harmonic Hall (SHH) measurement, in Pt/Co and Ta/CoFeB perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) systems, for damping-like and field-like SOT efficiency estimation. This method reveals a unique anomalous field-like torque dependent on magnetization direction in Ta/CoFeB system. The damping-like and field-like SOT efficiencies are extracted by solving LLGS equation in the low frequency limit of magnetic susceptibility. Along with SHH measurements, we also experimentally demonstrate anomalous Hall effect (AHE) based spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (STFMR) technique for SOT efficiency quantification in PMA systems.

Abstract: We introduce a contactless technique for probing superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, and magnetic ordering in micron-sized samples under extreme pressure. Utilizing a multistage Lenz lens system, directly sputtered onto diamond anvils, we realize a radio-frequency (RF, 50 kHz - 200 MHz) transformer with a sample, of 50-100 microns in diameter, as its core. This configuration enables efficient transfer and focusing of an electromagnetic field within the diamond anvil cell's chamber. Consequently, the transmitted RF signal exhibits high sensitivity to variations in the sample's surface conductivity and magnetic permeability. We validate this method by determining the critical temperatures ($T_{\text{c}}$) of known superconductors, including NbTi, MgB$_2$, Hg-1223, BSCCO, and REBCO in various magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic ordering temperatures of Gd and Tb, and the metal-insulator transition in VO$_2$. Notably, we apply this technique to the (La,Ce)H$_{10-12}$ superhydride at a pressure of about 150 GPa. The observed superconducting transition, at 215-220 K, is noticeably higher than the $T_{\text{c}}$ determined via traditional electrical-resistance measurements (200-205 K), demonstrating the method's enhanced sensitivity. Moreover, we show how multiple repetitions of the RF experiment with the La-Ce superhydride make it possible to detect the increase in $T_{\text{c}}$ over time up to 260-270 K. This finding opens a pathway towards reaching a critical $T_{\text{c}}$ above 0$^\circ$C in the La-based superhydrides.

Abstract: The stabilization of macromolecules is fundamental to developing biological formulations, such as vaccines and protein therapeutics. In this study, we employ coarse grained polymer models to investigate the impact of four sugars: $\alpha$-glucose, $\beta$-fructose, trehalose, and sucrose on macromolecule stability. Free energy decomposition and preferential interaction analysis indicate that polymer-sugar interactions favor folding at low concentrations while driving unfolding at higher concentrations. In contrast, the polymer-solvent soft interaction entropy consistently favors unfolding across all sugar concentrations under study. At low sugar concentrations, polymer-solvent interactions predominantly govern stabilization, whereas at higher concentrations, entropic penalties dictate polymer stability. Local mixing entropy demonstrates that binary sugar mixtures introduce entropic contributions that preferentially stabilize the folded state. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of sugar-based excipient stabilization mechanisms, offering guidance for the rational design of stable biological formulations.

Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelate superconductors are typically synthesized as thin films and thus include, besides the more bulk-like inner layers, distinct surface and interface layers in contact with the vacuum and substrate, respectively. Here, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to investigate how electronic correlations influence these surface and interface regions. Our results show that electronic correlations can significantly modify the electronic structure, even driving surface layers into a Mott-insulating state with a 3$d^8$ electronic configuration. Moreover, surface termination effects induce a polar field that can shift the $\Gamma$ and $A$ pocket above the Fermi level, even for the undoped parent compound NdNiO$_2$. Finally, for an $n$-type interface, often synthesized experimentally, we find the Ti 3$d$ orbitals to become electron doped.

Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the Anderson model in one dimension with "stealthy" disorder, defined as having a power spectrum that vanishes in a continuous band of wave numbers. Motivated by recent studies on the optical transparency properties of stealthy hyperuniform layered media, we compute the localization length using a perturbative expansion of the self-energy. We find that, for fixed energy and small but finite disorder strength $W$, there exists for any finite length system a range of stealthiness $\chi$ for which the localization length exceeds the system size. This kind of "effective delocalization" is the result of the novel kind of correlated disorder that spans a continuous range of length scales, a defining characteristic of stealthy systems. Unlike uncorrelated disorder, for which the localization length $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2}$ to leading order for small W, the leading order terms in the perturbation expansion of $\xi$ for stealthy disordered systems vanish identically for a progressively large number of terms as $\chi$ increases such that $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2n}$ with arbitrarily large $n$. Moreover, we support our analytical results with numerical simulations. Our results introduce stealthy disorder into quantum tight-binding models and show that enforcing a low-$k$ spectral gap markedly alters the scattering landscape, enabling localization lengths that exceed the system size at fixed disorder strength. Since this mechanism relies only on the spectral properties of the disorder, it carries over directly to photonic and phononic wave systems.

Abstract: The linear viscoelastic response of single semiflexible polymer chains in the infinite-dilution limit is studied using Brownian dynamics simulations of coarse-grained bead-spring chains. The springs obey the FENE-Fraenkel force law, a bending potential is used to capture chain stiffness and hydrodynamic interactions are included through the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor. By calculating the relaxation modulus following a step strain, we demonstrate that the bead-spring chain behaves like an inextensible semiflexible rod over a wide time window with an appropriate choice of spring stiffness and chain extensibility. In the absence of hydrodynamic interactions, our results agree with the existing theoretical predictions for the linear viscoelastic response of free-draining, inextensible, semiflexible rods in the limit of infinite dilution. It is shown that at intermediate times, the stress relaxation modulus exhibits power law behaviour, with the exponent ranging from $(-1/2)$ for flexible chains to $(-5/4)$ for highly rigid chains. At long times, rigid chains undergo orientational relaxation, while flexible chains exhibit Rouse relaxation. Hydrodynamic interactions are found to effect the behaviour at intermediate and long times, with the difference from free-draining behaviour increasing with increasing chain flexibility. Computations of the frequency dependence of loss and storage moduli are found to be in good agreement with experimental data for a wide variety of systems involving semiflexible polymers of varying stiffness across a broad frequency range.

Abstract: The magnetic spin Hall effect is a time-reversal-odd phenomenon in which spin current is induced by the charge current. In the presence of a spin-orbit coupling and/or noncolinear magnetism, however, spin current is not uniquely defined. Instead, we study an intrinsic response of spin to an electric field gradient that describes the spin accumulation at the boundaries of magnetic systems. We derive a generic formula expressed by Bloch wave functions and apply it to a minimal model for representative altermagnets, RuO$_{2}$ and MnF$_{2}$. Our results show that the intrinsic spin accumulation can be nonzero in magnetic insulators in sharp contrast to the magnetic spin Hall conductivity.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate electron transport in junctions between the two altermagnets (AMs) in strong and weak altermagnetic phases. The charge and spin conductivities are analyzed as functions of angle $\theta$ between the N\'eel vectors of the two AMs. In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as $\theta \to \pi$, while in the weak AM regime it remains finite. Introducing a normal metal between two AMs leads to Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations in charge conductivity which can be controlled by an applied gate voltage. In the strong regime, transport is dominated by up-spin electrons, whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak regime. These results highlight the potential of AM-based heterostructures for spintronic applications, such as spin filters, and quantum interference-based spintronic devices, where tunable spin-dependent transport and interference effects can be utilized in electronic devices.

Abstract: Effective Hamiltonians (EHs) are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter. Reconstructing an EH directly from experimental data is challenging due to the intricate relationship between EH parameters and observables. Complementary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for EH reconstruction (EHR). We reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole (e-h) Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG induced by quasi-cw NIR and THz lasers. We perform polarimetry of high-order sidebands while varying the wavelength and polarization of the NIR laser and the strength of the THz field, to systematically explore the information encoded in the sidebands. Based on previous understanding of HSG in GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry (BWI), an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the EH parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in GaAs are known from existing experiments, we show that the GaAs bandgap, two dephasing constants associated with two e-h species, and an EH parameter that determines the e-h reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through BWI. We demonstrate that full EHR can be achieved by combining HSG measurements with absorbance spectroscopy. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is about 13\,meV higher than the value inferred from previous absorbance measurements. Quantum-kinetic analysis suggests that the e-h energy in HSG may be renormalized through Fr\"ohlich interaction that is modified by a strong THz field. We show that the energy threshold for optical-phonon emission can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.

Abstract: The dynamics of the superconducting phase difference across a Josephson junction can be described within the resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson junction (RCSJ) model. Microscopic derivations of this model traditionally rely on the tunneling limit. Here, we present a derivation of a generalized version of the RCSJ model, which accounts for dissipative currents with nonlinear current-voltage characteristics as well as supercurrents with arbitrary current-phase relations. This requires a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem to describe the Langevin current, which we deduce along the lines of fluctuation theorems for mesoscopic conductors. Our work is motivated in particular by recent theories of the Josephson diode effect, which is not captured within the RCSJ model in the tunneling limit.

Abstract: We uncover a universal two-stage dynamics during skyrmion formation and establish its connection to equilibrium phases through the introduction of a chiral correlation $\chi$. Stage I involves stripe coarsening governed by the exchange-to-DMI ratio $J'$, while stage II entails stripe contraction driven by the synergy between $J'$ and the anisotropy-to-DMI ratio $K'$. The magnetic field-to-DMI ratio $B'$ influences both stages. By combining symbolic regression with neural networks, we model the competition and cooperation among these parameters and derive a skyrmion formation criterion, $0.58 K'J' + \mu B'J' > 1$. Our model disentangles their distinct roles: $J'$ sets the stripe width, $K'$ primarily controls the skyrmion size, and $B'$ strongly affects the topological charge. This approach provides a general framework for predicting and controlling magnetic phases in chiral magnets.

Abstract: We derive an analog of the Lellouch-L\"uscher (LL) relation for few-body bosonic systems, linking few-body scattering loss rates to the energies and widths of the corresponding harmonically trapped few-body states. Three-body numerical simulations show that the LL relation applies across a broad range of interaction strengths and energies and allows the determination of scattering rates within a single partial wave. Our work establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the role of the finite volume effect in few-body observables in optical lattice and tweezer experiments, enabling precise determination of multi-body scattering rates.

Abstract: We consider the electronic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on a square lattice with the Fermi level near van Hove singularity and the ratio of the next-nearest-neighbor and nearest-neighbor hoppings $t'/t=-0.45$, which favours the ferromagnetic instability. We find, that a self-consistent consideration of the ferromagnetic fluctuations within the D-TRILEX approach results in the splitting of the electronic spectral function at low temperatures. This splitting exhibits only a weak momentum dependence, and only one of the split bands crosses the Fermi level. As a result, the Fermi surface itself remains unsplit, but its area increases, reflecting the presence of non-Fermi-liquid electronic excitations. We show that both the self-consistent account of the non-local contributions to the electronic self-energy and the proper treatment of electron interaction vertices in D-TRILEX are important to obtain this behaviour.

Abstract: All the fundamental interactions (such as gravity or electromagnetic interactions) are reciprocal in nature. However, in the macroscopic world, in particular outside equilibrium, non-reciprocal or non-mutual interactions are quite ubiquitous. Understanding the impact of such non-reciprocal interactions has drawn a significant amount of interest in physics and other fields of sciences in recent years. We explore a non-reciprocal version of coupled oscillators (known as the Kuramoto model) with the aim of understanding the role of non-reciprocity, particularly in relation to chimera states, where oscillators spontaneously break into mutually synchronous and asynchronous groups. Our findings suggest that non-reciprocity not only alters the state diagram of the chimera state significantly but can also lead to new dynamical states, such as traveling chimera, run-and-chase and coexistence phases.

Abstract: Janus derivatives of 2H MX2 (M = Mo/W; X = S/Se), namely MSSe, have already been experimentally realized and explored for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and optoelectronics. Focusing on the photocatalytic properties of these layers, we investigate the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on the MSSe layers in the presence of metalloid dopants B, Si, and Ge. The layers in their pristine form exhibit positive adsorption energies, indicating an endothermic nature. Substitution of a dopant in the pristine MSSe layers alters the local symmetry, bonding character, and charge distribution, thereby increasing the number of active sites for hosting H adsorption and reducing the adsorption energy. We select distinct sites, both atomic and interstitial, for the substitution of dopants. The energetics of the H atom at various sites is studied to find the most favorable active site on the MSSe Janus layers. Our results based on density functional theory calculations show that the adsorption process becomes spontaneous and less attractive in the presence of atomic site dopant substitution, whereas the interstitial site results in an endothermic behavior. Moreover, having the data from DFT, we develop a supervised machine learning model for predicting the hydrogen adsorption energy. For this purpose, we utilize 23 elemental features of the atoms involved in the structure, thereby eliminating the need for DFT calculations in feature design. The dimensionality reduction technique, principal component analysis, is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, yielding independent features that are mutually orthogonal. The model is implemented as a multi-layer perceptron regressor with two hidden layers. The data augmentation technique is employed to artificially expand the dataset size, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the neural network model by 0.90% on the testing data.

Abstract: The single-layered perovskite Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, characterized by a 4$d^4$ electron configuration, has been studied from first principles using density functional theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation, with inclusion of strong on-site Coulomb interactions and spin-orbit coupling (GGA+SO+$U$), in the framework of the fully relativistic, spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) band-structure method. This approach enabled a comprehensive investigation of the electronic structure of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ through the modeling of relevant spectra obtained from synchrotron-based techniques widely used to probe electronic properties, with a primary focus on resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ru $L_3$ and O $K$ edges. The calculated spectra were thoroughly analyzed with available experimental data reported in the literature. The good agreement between our results and experimental observations for Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ enables a conclusive interpretation of key features in the spectra obtained from the aforementioned techniques. Consequently, this enables us to describe its electronic properties and to establish a solid theoretical approach suitable for routine modeling of spectra, particularly from RIXS, aimed at characterizing the electronic structure and properties of similar or more complex strongly correlated, technologically relevant materials.

Abstract: Self-heating in next-generation, high-power-density field-effect transistor limits performance and complicates fabrication. Here, we introduce NEP-FET, a machine-learned framework for device-scale heat transport simulations of field-effect transistors. Built upon the neuroevolution potential, the model extends a subset of the OMat24 dataset through an active-learning workflow to generate a chemically diverse, interface-rich reference set. Coupled with the FETMOD structure generator module, NEP-FET can simulate realistic field-effect transistor geometries at sub-micrometer scales containing millions of atoms, and delivers atomistic predictions of temperature fields, per-atom heat flux, and thermal stress in device structures with high fidelity. This framework enables rapid estimation of device-level metrics, including heat-flux density and effective thermal conductivity. Our results reveal pronounced differences in temperature distribution between fin-type and gate-all-around transistor architectures. The framework closes a key gap in multiscale device modeling by combining near-quantum-mechanical accuracy with device-scale throughput, providing a systematic route to explore heat transport and thermo-mechanical coupling in advanced transistors.

Abstract: Interactions in Many-body systems are typically short-range and few-body. We investigate how such local interactions build up long-range and intrinsically multipartite entanglement by studying the $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ($\text{GHZ}_n$) entanglement in monitored random Clifford circuits, which is well-known for a measurement-induced transition between phases of volume-law and area-law (bipartite) entanglement. We obtain a series of results: (1) About 1.25 $|\text{GHZ}_3\rangle$ can be extracted from states in the volume-law phase. This value is remarkably universal, independent of both the measurement rate and partitioning details, until a phase transition (either measurement-induced or a newly identified partitioning-induced transition) is approached. (2) Dynamically, The creation (sometimes also the annihilation) of $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement occur suddenly via dynamical phase transitions (DPTs). The critical points of these DPTs are governed by the entanglement speed ($v_E$) of biaprtite entanglement. (3) In stark contrast to $\text{GHZ}_{n\leq 3}$, $\text{GHZ}_{n\geq 4}$ entanglement is statistically significant only at the measurement-induced critical point, not in the bulk of the volume-law phase. Our results uncover a rich and previously overlooked hierarchy of multipartite entanglement structures.

Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians is a fundamental task for which it is believed that quantum computers can be helpful. Several approaches have been proposed toward this goal, including algorithms based on quantum phase estimation and hybrid quantum-classical optimizers involving parameterized quantum circuits, the latter falling under the umbrella of the variational quantum eigensolver. Here, we analyze the performance of quantum Boltzmann machines for this task, which is a less explored ansatz based on parameterized thermal states and which is not known to suffer from the barren-plateau problem. We delineate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for this task and rigorously prove that it converges to an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point of the energy function optimized over parameter space, while using a number of parameterized-thermal-state samples that is polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, the number of parameters, and the norm of the Hamiltonian being optimized. Our algorithm estimates the gradient of the energy function efficiently by means of a quantum circuit construction that combines classical random sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. Additionally, supporting our main claims are calculations of the gradient and Hessian of the energy function, as well as an upper bound on the matrix elements of the latter that is used in the convergence analysis.

Abstract: We demonstrate that including the second viscosity of an electron gas in the hydrodynamic model allows for highly accurate modeling of the optical response of heavily doped semiconductors. In our setup, which improves resonance visibility compared to previous approaches, plasmon resonances become more distinct, allowing for a detailed analysis of the underlying physics. With advanced fitting techniques based on a physics-informed cost function and a tailored optimization algorithm, we obtain a close agreement between simulations and experimental data across different sample thicknesses. This enhanced resonance visibility, combined with our integrated approach, shows that key parameters such as doping level and effective electron mass, as well as the second viscosity of the electron gas, can be retrieved from a single optical measurement. The spatial dispersion taken into account in the hydrodynamic framework is essential for accurately describing the optical response of plasmonic materials in this frequency range and is likely to become a standard modeling approach.

Abstract: Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and at each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise by averaging their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, then consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps, provided the initial opinions are in a general position. The number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that the smallest number of steps is $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$ when the initial opinions are in a general position. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps. In particular, we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.

Abstract: Natural flocks (aligned) and swarms (non-aligned) both exhibit features of near-criticality, challenging their treatment as two ends of the same phase transition. We present a model for the aggregation of active individuals, in which their velocities align as a byproduct of achieving stable cohesion. In our framework, individuals move in open space and possess differing self-propelling velocities. Furthermore, velocity fluctuations are triggered by individual errors when following the aggregation rules. Notably, the system exhibits scale invariance, which is shown to be rooted in the model's definition -- a feature that we label as structural criticality. Finally, we show the emergence of a striking regime where spatial and orientational coherence decouple. That is, the system can achieve states of high and low polarization while maintaining spatial homogeneity.

Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.
