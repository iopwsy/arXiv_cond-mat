Ashkan Shekaari
First-principles density-functional theory calculations were carried out to assess how incremental unit-cell charging alters the electronic behavior of SLSiN (single-layer Si$_3$N$_4$). The net charge per cell was systematically tuned from $n\,=\,0$ (the neutral/reference configuration) to $n\,=\,\pm\,1,\pm\,2$, and $\pm\,3$ elementary charges, and for each charged configuration the band structure and density of states were evaluated at the PBE level. In its neutral state, SLSiN exhibits zero electronegativity, signifying both its indifference to additional electron density and its intrinsic stability when integrated into heterostructures. Altogether, these results reveal that precise control of the charge density can drive SLSiN across an insulator-to-metal transition.

Erik S. Samuelsen, Yuli V. Nazarov
Andreev molecule states arise from hybridization of Andreev bound states in different Josephson Junctions. Extensive theoretical and experimental research concentrates on direct coherent electron coupling between the junctions: this implies the distance between the junctions is of the order of superconducting coherence length, that is, short.
  We propose and discuss the possibility to create Andreev molecules at long (in principle, arbitrary long) distance between the junctions. In this case, the hybridized states are excited quasi-particle singlets and the coupling is provided by an embedding electric circuit. To achieve a strong hybridization, one aligns the energies of the Andreev bound states with associated phase differences. In fact, a recent experiment realizes such setup.
  With circuit theory we derive the hybridization level splitting and estimate the scale of the effect. Since the phenomenon encompasses excited states, we derive and solve the associated Lindblad equation under condition of persistent resonant excitation. By analyzing the resulting dissipative dynamics we identify relevant regimes where the hybridization and resonant excitation peaks are most pronounced. The low-frequency mutual inductance of the Josephson junctions is an important signature of the molecular state and associated non-local Josephson effect. We demonstrate the peak structures for both mutual and self-inductance, and compute them in various frequency regimes.
  In an interesting common case the embedding circuit includes an oscillator, which can be used both to enhance hybridization and for state readout with two-tone spectroscopy. We derive and solve Lindblad equations for the conditions of two-tone spectroscopy to demonstrate the the readout of molecular states.

Benjamin Moy
We construct two classes of continuous phase transitions in 3+1 dimensions between phases that break distinct generalized global symmetries. Our analysis focuses on $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation. For $N$ even and sufficiently large odd $N_f$, upon imposing time-reversal symmetry and an $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, the massless theory realizes a quantum critical point between two gapped phases: one in which a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry is completely broken and another where it is broken to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, leading to $\mathbb{Z}_{N/2}$ topological order. We provide an explicit lattice model that exhibits this transition. The critical point has an enhanced symmetry, which includes non-invertible analogues of time-reversal symmetry. Enforcing a non-invertible time-reversal symmetry and the $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, for $N$ and $N_f$ both odd, we demonstrate that this critical point can appear between a topologically ordered phase and a phase that spontaneously breaks the non-invertible time-reversal symmetry, furnishing an analogue of deconfined quantum criticality for generalized symmetries.

Pradyumna P. Belgaonkar, Michal Zimmerman, Snir Gazit, Dror Orgad
We study the phase diagram of a bilayer of antiparallel dipolar excitons with a 1:2 density ratio between the layers, as a function of temperature and density. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that such a system supports the formation of trimers, namely, three-exciton bound states consisting of a single dipole in one layer and two dipoles in the second layer. At sufficiently low temperatures and densities, these trimers condense into a trimer superfluid phase. Increasing the excitonic density induces a quantum phase transition into a phase in which condensates of independent dipoles exist in both layers, in parallel to the trimers. We also study the thermal transitions out of these phases, and find that while the normal state is reached directly from the trimer superfluid, the thermal disordering of the two-superfluid phase involves an intermediate state which is either a trimer superfluid or a single excitonic condensate in the denser layer. A potential experimental realization using transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures is discussed.

Xin Chen, Eugen Dizer, Emilio Ramos Rodr\'iguez, Richard Schmidt
We present a unified theory that connects the quasiparticle picture of Fermi polarons for mobile impurities to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe for static impurities. By operator reordering of the underlying many-body Hamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a recoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the resulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity mass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We identify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of Fermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the impurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give rise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the limiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition is absent.

[6]. [*The Hilbert-space structure of free fermions in disguise*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15959 "The Hilbert-space structure of free fermions in disguise")
Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli
Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.

Alloy discovery is central to advancing modern industry but remains hindered by the vastness of compositional design space and the costly validation. Here, we present AutoMAT, a hierarchical and autonomous framework grounded in and validated by experiments, which integrates large language models, automated CALPHAD-based simulations, and AI-driven search to accelerate alloy design. Spanning the entire pipeline from ideation to validation, AutoMAT achieves high efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability without the need for manually curated large datasets. In a case study targeting a lightweight, high-strength alloy, AutoMAT identifies a titanium alloy with 8.1% lower density and comparable yield strength relative to the state-of-the-art reference, achieving the highest specific strength among all comparisons. In a second case targeting high-yield-strength high-entropy alloys, AutoMAT achieves a 28.2% improvement in yield strength over the base alloy. In both cases, AutoMAT reduces the discovery timeline from years to weeks, illustrating its potential as a scalable and versatile platform for next-generation alloy design.

Thierry Grenet, Julien Delahaye
In this article, we explore the temperature dependence of the electrical glassy dynamics in insulating amorphous indium oxide (a-InOx) and granular Al films. We use non-isothermal gate voltage protocols, which can reveal changes in the dynamics induced by the temperature, when logarithmic relaxations devoid of characteristic times are at work. We demonstrate that, contrary to almost 20 years of opposite belief, the dynamics of amorphous indium oxide films in the liquid helium temperature range is thermally activated, i.e. it slows down under cooling and accelerates upon heating. Amorphous indium oxide thus adds to the list of glassy disordered systems in which we already demonstrated thermal activation, which includes granular Al and amorphous NbxSi1-x films. Moreover, measurements up to 40 K in a-InOx and granular Al films reveal the close similarity between the two systems and a very anomalous character of the thermal activation, with an effective activation energy increasing with T as T^2 . We so far have no explanation for it. Its further study and understanding may be important for the physics of electron glasses.

Marton K. Lajer, Xin Dai, Kipton Barros, Matthew R. Carbone, S. Johnston, M. P. M. Dean
Identifying model Hamiltonians is a vital step toward creating predictive models of materials. Here, we combine Bayesian optimization with the EDRIXS numerical package to infer Hamiltonian parameters from resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra within the single atom approximation. To evaluate the efficacy of our method, we test it on experimental RIXS spectra of NiPS3, NiCl2, Ca3LiOsO6, and Fe2O3, and demonstrate that it can reproduce results obtained from hand-fitted parameters to a precision similar to expert human analysis while providing a more systematic mapping of parameter space. Our work provides a key first step toward solving the inverse scattering problem to extract effective multi-orbital models from information-dense RIXS measurements, which can be applied to a host of quantum materials. We also propose atomic model parameter sets for two materials, Ca3LiOsO6 and Fe2O3, that were previously missing from the literature.

R. David Mayrhofer, Megan Schoenzeit, Andrey V. Chubukov
We present the results of a mean-field analysis of the temperature evolution of a ferromagnetic Stoner transition in a two-dimensional (2D) system with an isotropic dispersion $\varepsilon_k \propto k^{2\alpha}$, which for $\alpha >1$ models flat dispersions in various multi-layer graphene systems in a displacement field. This study is an extension to a finite $T$ of previous studies at $T=0$, which found both first-order and second-order Stoner transitions, depending on the value of $\alpha$ and special behavior at $\alpha =1$ and $\alpha =2$. We find that the Stoner transition at a finite $T$ displays new features not seen at $T=0$. The most interesting one is the reentrant behavior, where the ordered state emerges as temperature is increased. This behavior develops at $\alpha >1.4$ and the range where it holds increases with $\alpha$. We conjecture that the reentrant behavior is the fundamental feature of the Stoner transition in 2D, not sensitive to the details of the electronic structure.

Jonathan Bauermann, Giacomo Bartolucci, Artemy Kolchinsky
We study chemical oscillators in the presence of phase separation. By imposing timescale separation between slow reactions and fast diffusion, we define a dynamics at phase equilibrium for the relevant degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that phase separation affects reaction kinetics by localizing reactants within phases, allowing for control of oscillator frequency and amplitude. The analysis is validated with a spatial model. Finally, relaxing the timescale separation between reactions and diffusion leads to waves of phase equilibria at mesoscopic scales.

Mingru Yang, Sajant Anand, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen
The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.

Duy Nguyen, Jay A. Gupta
We report the formation of Bi(111) bilayer (BL) islands and crater structures on Bi$_2$Te$_3$(111) surfaces induced by voltage pulses from an STM tip. Pulses above a threshold voltage ($+3$ V) produce craters $\sim 0.5$ microns in diameter, similar to the size of the tip. Redeposited material self-assembles into a network of atomically ordered islands with a lattice constant identical to the underlying Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface. The island size monotonically decreases over several microns from the pulse site, until the pristine Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface is recovered. We assign these islands to Bi BL based on atomic resolution images, analysis of step heights, and tunneling spectroscopy. The dependence of bilayer formation on bias polarity and the evidence for defect diffusion together suggest a mechanism driven by the interplay of field evaporation and tunneling-current-induced Joule heating.

Luke J. Wirth (Department of Materials Science,Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, USA), Dallas R. Trinkle (Department of Materials Science,Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, USA)
External magnetic fields reduce diffusion of carbon in BCC iron, but the physical mechanism is not understood. Using DFT calculations with magnetic moments sampled from a Heisenberg model, we calculate diffusivities of carbon in iron at high temperatures and with field. Our model reproduces the measured suppression of diffusivity from field. We find that increasing magnetic disorder flattens the electron density of states compared with the ferromagnetic case, which distorts the octahedral cages around carbon, lowering the activation barrier to diffusion; an applied field reverses these trends.

Gino Domel, Ehsan Hajiesmaili, David R. Clarke
An optically addressable and configurable electrode architecture for dielectric elastomer actuators and arrays is described. It is based on embedding photoconductive, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires in the DEA to create electrodes. Normally, a network of ZnO nanowires is electrically insulating but it becomes conductive in the presence of UV light with a photon energy above the optical bandgap. Taking advantage of this characteristic optical induced switching behavior, we create an optically addressable electrode design, and create new, localized capacitor structures. As the ZnO nanowires are only conductive where, and when, illuminated the effective electrode structure is not fixed, as is the case with CNT and carbon-black electrodes currently used in DEAs. This provides greater, previously unattainable, freedom in the design of dielectric elastomer actuators for soft robotics and devices.

[16]. [*Observation of a phase transition in KTaO$_3$ induced by residual niobium impurities*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16093 "Observation of a phase transition in KTaO$_3$ induced by residual niobium impurities")
Zijun C. Zhao, Jeremy F. Bourhill, Maxim Goryachev, Aleksey Sadekov, Michael E. Tobar
We report the observation of a phase transition in a KTaO$_3$ crystal, corresponding to a paraelectric-to-ferroelectric transition. The crystal was placed inside a copper cavity to form a dielectric-loaded microwave cavity, and the transition was observed to occur near 134 K. As the cavity was cooled, the frequencies of both transverse electric and transverse magnetic resonant modes decreased (corresponding to an increase in permittivity). The mode frequencies converge at the transition temperature (near 134 K) and, below this point, reverse their tuning direction, increasing their frequency with decreasing temperature. This behaviour corresponds to a decrease in dielectric permittivity and is atypical for pure KTaO$_3$. To investigate further, we conducted impurity analysis using Laser Ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), revealing a significant concentration ($\sim$ 7\%) of niobium (Nb) in the crystal. This suggests that the observed phase transition is driven by residual Nb impurities, which induce ferroelectricity in an otherwise paraelectric host. Similar crystals with a lower concentration ($<$ 2\%) did not undergo a phase transition but exhibited a loss peak at this temperature. These findings have practical implications for the design of tunable devices, for example, resonator-based dark matter detectors, where low-loss material phase stability and tunability are crucial.

Ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors promise to revolutionize power electronics, yet a fundamental understanding of their interfacial electronic structure has been hindered by the absence of direct experimental observation. Here, we report the first momentum-resolved observation of two-dimensional electron systems on a UWBG material, enabled by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on high-purity $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ single crystals. Alkaline-metal-induced electron doping forms an isotropic circular Fermi surface, achieving a sheet carrier density of up to $1.0\times10^{14}$ $\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Self-consistent Poisson-Schr\"odinger calculations show that the electrons are confined within 1.2 nm of the surface and reveal an internal electric field of $18$ MV cm$^{-1}$. Crucially, our measurements reveal a pronounced renormalization of the electronic band structure: a series of carrier-density-dependent ARPES measurements shows that as the carrier density increases from $2\times10^{13}$ to $1.0\times10^{14}$ $\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, the effective mass anomalously increases, nearly doubling to a final value of 0.48 $\textit{m}_{\mathrm{e}}$. This trend is notably opposite to that reported for other oxide semiconductors, pointing towards a unique renormalization mechanism in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Our findings establish the interfacial electronic structure of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and demonstrate that UWBG materials provide fertile ground for exploring carrier-density-driven electronic phenomena, opening new avenues for future quantum and power devices.

BiFeO3 has attracted much attention as a potential candidate for replacing conventional, lead based piezoelectric materials due to its remarkable spontaneous polarization and high Curie temperature. However, its inherent high leakage currents, which lead to low piezoelectric response and poor temperature stability, have severely limited its practical applications. In this study, lead free piezoelectric ceramics of the 0.7BiFeO3-0.3BaTiO3 (BF-BT) system were prepared, and their microstructures along with high-temperature electrical performance were modulated by introducing Nd3+. The results indicate that moderate Nd doping improves lattice symmetry and reduces oxygen vacancy-related defect dipoles, thereby effectively suppressing leakage currents at temperatures above 75{\deg}C. The Nddoped samples exhibit significantly lower leakage current densities, reduced by over 99% compared to the undoped ceramics, reaching values as low as 10-5Acm-2. They also show higher resistivity under elevated temperatures and electric fields, offering notable improvements in thermal stability over the undoped counterparts. In addition, the Nd-doped samples achieved piezoelectric coefficients as high as 172 pC N -1 at room temperature while still maintaining high dielectric and piezoelectric responses at elevated temperatures. This work not only provides an effective way to solve the leakage current problem of BF-BT ceramics in high temperature applications but also indicates a new design strategy for optimizing the high temperature stability of lead free piezoelectric materials, which shows a broad application prospect in the field of high-temperature sensors and actuators.

Yonghao Zhu, Zhi Wang, Junwei Luo, Lin-Wang Wang
The large discrepancy between experimental and theoretical remanent polarization and coercive field limits the applications of wide-band-gap ferroelectric materials. Here, using a machine-learning potential trained on ab-initio molecular dynamics data, we identify a new mechanism of the interplay between polarization domain wall (PDW) and lattice domain wall (LDW) in ferroelectric k-phase gallium oxide (Ga2O3), which reconciles predictions with experimental observations. Our results reveal that the reversal of out-of-plane polarization is achieved through in-plane sliding and shear of the Ga-O sublayers. This pathway creates strong anisotropy in PDW propagation, and crucially leads to topologically forbidden PDW propagation across the 120 degree LDWs observed in synthesized samples. The resulting stable network of residual domain walls bypasses slow nucleation and suppresses the observable polarization and coercive field. These insights highlight the potential for tailoring the ferroelectric response in k-Ga2O3 from lattice-domain engineering.

Jos\'e Armando P\'erez-Loera, Wolfgang Bietenholz
The Kibble mechanism plays a prominent role in the theory of the early Universe, as an explanation of the possible formation of cosmic strings. Zurek suggested the analogous effect in liquid helium under rapid cooling, and he conjectured - together with del Campo and Kibble - a scaling-law for the relation between the density of remnant topological defects and the cooling rate, when a system passes through its critical temperature. Such scaling-laws were indeed observed in condensed matter experiments.
  Here we test the validity of Zurek's scaling-law in a different framework. We numerically study the behavior of the Ising model (with classical spins) in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions under rapid cooling. This model does not have topological defects, so we consider the dynamics of domains instead, i.e. we measure their evolution during a cooling process down to zero temperature. For several Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, we consistently observe scaling-laws along the lines of Zurek's conjecture, in all dimensions under consideration, which shows that this feature holds more generally than expected. It is highly remarkable that even the exponents of these scaling-laws are consistent for three different algorithms, which hints at a physical meaning.

Sangyun Lee, Duk. Y. Kim, Andrew J. Woods, Priscila F. S. Rosa, E. D. Bauer, Filip Ronning, Shi-Zeng Lin, R. Movshovich
Metals typically have multiple Fermi surface sheets, and when they enter the superconducting state, some electrons on these sheets may remain uncondensed, or their superconducting pairs can be rapidly destroyed by a magnetic field. Detecting uncondensed electrons within the superconducting state provides key information about the underlying electronic structure; however, this task remains a significant experimental challenge. Here we demonstrate quantum oscillations from the uncondensed electrons in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn5, observed through thermal conductivity measurements with a magnetic field rotating within the tetragonal a-b plane. We detect a fine structure in thermal conductivity, characterized by multiple small resonances (oscillations) in a rotating magnetic field. Remarkably, the phase of these resonances shifted by as much as {\pi} for a field above 9.7 T where spin-density wave (SDW) order emerges and coexists with superconductivity. This phase shift is naturally explained by a change in the Berry phase of the uncondensed Fermi surface, driven by the Fermi surface reconstruction associated with the onset of SDW order. Our work unambiguously shows the existence of uncondensed electrons in the superconducting state of CeCoIn5, thus resolving a longstanding debate on this issue.

Phase separation in biomolecular mixtures can result from multiple physical interactions, which may act either complementarily or antagonistically. In the case of protein--nucleic acid mixtures, charge plays a key role but can have contrasting effects on phase behavior. Attractive electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged macromolecules are screened by added salt, reducing the driving force for coacervation. By contrast, base-pairing interactions between nucleic acids are diminished by charge repulsion and thus enhanced by added salt, promoting associative phase separation. To explore this interplay, we combine experiment and theory to map the complex phase behavior of a model solution of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and self-complementary DNA nanostars (NS) as a function of temperature, ionic strength, and macromolecular composition. Despite having opposite salt dependences, we find that electrostatics and base pairing cooperate to stabilize NS--PLL coacervation at high ionic strengths and temperatures, leading to two-phase or three-phase coexistence under various conditions. We further observe a variety of kinetic pathways to phase separation at different salt concentrations, resulting in the formation of nonequilibrium aggregates or droplets whose compositions evolve on long timescales. Finally, we show that the cooperativity between electrostatics and base pairing can be used to create multiphase coacervates that partition various NS species at intermediate salt concentrations. Our results illustrate how the interplay between distinct interaction modes can greatly increase the complexity of the phase behavior relative to systems with a single type of interaction.

Long-life interlayer excitons (IXs) in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructure are promising for realizing excitonic condensates at high temperatures. Critical to this objective is to separate the IX ground state (the lowest energy of IX state) emission from other states emissions. Filtering the IX ground state is also essential in uncovering the dynamics of correlated excitonic states, such as the excitonic Mott insulator. Here, we show that the IX ground state in WSe2/MoS2 heterobilayer can be separated from other states by its spatial profile. The emissions from different moire IX modes are identified by their different energies and spatial distributions, which fits well with the rate-diffusion model for cascading emission. Our results show spatial filtering of the ground state mode and enrich the toolbox to realize correlated states at elevated temperatures.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials formed by interconnected metal atoms via organic linkers, resulting in high surface area and tuneable porosity, making them exceptional candidates for CO2 capture. However, their stability and efficacy in humid conditions are not fully understood, often limiting their commercial applications. Here, we estimate the stability of seven common Zn-based MOFs using reactive molecular dynamics (MD) along with metadynamics sampling to determine hydrolysis energetics at conditions representative of low water concentration limit. The reactions' free energy surfaces (FESs) showed that water stability strongly depends on its linker size and chemistry. Our findings indicate zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of MOFs, exhibit higher water stability than iso-reticular metal-organic frameworks (IRMOFs). We further attempt to correlate hydrolysis energy barrier with the physicochemical descriptors of these MOFs. This study provides insights into the critical factors and fundamental implications for developing stable porous materials for carbon capture technologies.

Sleeba Varghese, Pierre Illien, Benjamin Rotenberg
Understanding the dynamic behavior of polar fluids is essential for modeling complex systems such as electrolytes and biological media. In this work, we develop and apply a Stochastic Density Functional Theory (SDFT) framework to describe the polarization dynamics in the Stockmayer fluid, a prototypical model of dipolar liquids consisting of Lennard-Jones particles with embedded point dipoles. Starting from the overdamped Langevin dynamics of dipolar particles, we derive analytical expressions for the intermediate scattering functions and dynamic structure factors of the longitudinal and transverse components of the polarization field, within linearized SDFT. To assess the theory's validity, we compare its predictions with results from Brownian Dynamics simulations of the Stockmayer fluid. We find that SDFT captures the longitudinal polarization fluctuations accurately, while transverse fluctuations are underestimated due to the neglect of dipolar correlations. By incorporating the Kirkwood factor into a modified SDFT, we recover quantitative agreement for both components across a range of dipole strengths. This study highlights the utility of SDFT as a coarse-grained description of polar fluid dynamics and provides insights into the role of collective effects in polarization relaxation.

Yi-Ming Duan, Liang-Jun He, Fabian Maucher, Yong-Chang Zhang
We explore phases of two-component Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates in three spatial dimensions. The competition between the effective ranges of inter- and intra-component soft-core interactions leads to a rich variety of ground states. These include states resembling ionic compounds with face-centered cubic or simple cubic lattice structure. Upon increasing the scattering length, the dimensionality of the symmetry-breaking is lower due to the suppression of large densities, leading to segregated planar or tubular density profiles. We also show that these states are not only stable ground states, but can also emerge dynamically upon time evolution.

Defect engineering offers an important route to property tuning of nanostructured coatings for advanced applications. Transition metal nitrides, such as CrN, are widely used for their mechanical resilience, but their nitrogen-rich analogue CrN2 remains poorly understood, especially at the atomic scale. This study employs density functional theory to investigate the energetics as well as how intrinsic defects (vacancies, interstitials, and anti-sites) and extrinsic impurities (hydrogen and oxygen) influence the structural, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical response of CrN2, in comparison to the more commonly studied CrN. With directional N-N bonding and semiconducting character, CrN2 shows high sensitivity to defect incorporation, including local spin polarisation, gap states, and mechanical softening. In contrast, CrN's metallic character enables effective screening of similar defects, preserving its structural, magnetic, electronic and mechanical integrity. However, hydrogen induces anisotropic distortions and mechanical degradation in CrN, while oxygen enhances hardness. These findings reveal how defect chemistry and bonding anisotropy govern mechanical performance, with implications for nanoscale control in coatings design.

F. Detcheverry
A variety of bacterial species spontaneously assemble in aerotactic band, local accumulation at a fixed distance from the air-water interface. Although the phenomenon is long known, its modelling is so far limited to mesoscopic, one-dimensional or numerical descriptions. We investigate band properties at the microscopic scale using exact solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation. First, we show that the interplay between oxygen consumption and tumbling modulation is governed by a third-order nonlinear differential equation relating the oxygen concentration to the aerotactic response. For two model aerotactic behaviors, we present analytical solutions and discuss the resulting band structure. Second, we investigate how an aerotactic band of magnetotactic bacteria in a magnetic field induces a spontaneous fluid flow, as observed in experiments [Marmol et al, arXiv 2025]. In the low field limit, we determine the bacterial distribution and the active stress tensor. Using the Green function of the hydrodynamic problem, we obtain a prediction for the fluid flow that is both simple and consistent with observations. Altogether, our results provide a model system of aerotactic band and solid ground to analyze aerotaxis-driven self-organization.

Liucheng Chen, Mingwei Ma, Xiaohui Yu, Fang Hong
The charge density wave (CDW) is a macroscopic quantum state characterized by long-range lattice distortion and modulated charge density. Conventionally, CDWs compete with other electronic orders (e.g. superconductivity) and are suppressed under hydrostatic pressure. Intriguingly, the Kagome-variant metal BaFe2Al9, crystallized in a three-dimensional structure, exhibits pressure-enhanced CDW ordering, where the transition temperature (TCDW) rises from ~110 K to room temperature near 3.6 GPa. The lattice structure was checked by both powder and single crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD data reveals an abnormal lattice expansion along a axis near 4-5 GPa upon compression. The strongly suppressed diffraction intensity and splitting diffraction spots from single crystal indicates cracking and breakdown to smaller pieces, indicative of an intrinsic first-order transition character. This anomalous response implies a CDW mechanism dominated by electron-electron and/or electron-phonon correlations, distinct from Fermi-surface nesting in conventional systems. Concomitant dome-shaped pressure-dependent resistance suggests competing electronic phases. Our work establishes BaFe2Al9 as a 3D Kagome platform with unconventional CDW behavior and strong electron-phonon coupling, which provides an alternative platform to explore the electron correlation induced exotic electronic states and other potential emergent quantum phenomenon.

Topological insulators are a new class of insulators with conducting surface state. Most of the topological insulators are chalcogenides, where a tiny amount of chalcogen vacancy destroys the predicted bulk insulating state and results in a metallic or semimetallic bulk electrical transport. BaBiO$_3$ (BBO) is an interesting large bandgap (0.7 eV) insulator that upon hole doping becomes a superconductor and is theoretically predicted to show a topological insulating state under electron doping. We have explored electron doping through the chemical substitution of fluorine atoms at the oxygen site. The single crystals of BBO and fluorine doped BBO were synthesized via a one-step solid-state technique. The single crystals of pure BBO and 10 % F -doped BBO (BaBiO$_{2.7}$F$_{0.3}$) are chemically single-phase samples and crystallize in monoclinic I2/m crystal structure. The core level and valence band X-ray photoelectron spectra confirm electron doping in the 10% fluorine-doped BBO. 20 % F-doped BBO appears to be a multiphase sample, confirmed by back-scattered electron (BSE) imaging and X-ray diffraction. This article reports on the successful growth of pure and F-doped BBO using a one-step solid-state technique and discusses the effect of F-doping on structural and electronic properties.

Designing high-performance amorphous alloys is demanding for various applications. But this process intensively relies on empirical laws and unlimited attempts. The high-cost and low-efficiency nature of the traditional strategies prevents effective sampling in the enormous material space. Here, we propose material networks to accelerate the discovery of binary and ternary amorphous alloys. The network topologies reveal hidden material candidates that were obscured by traditional tabular data representations. By scrutinizing the amorphous alloys synthesized in different years, we construct dynamical material networks to track the history of the alloy discovery. We find that some innovative materials designed in the past were encoded in the networks, demonstrating their predictive power in guiding new alloy design. These material networks show physical similarities with several real-world networks in our daily lives. Our findings pave a new way for intelligent materials design, especially for complex alloys.

Rinske M. Alkemade, Frank Smallenburg, Laura Filion
Understanding the role that structure plays in the dynamical arrest observed in glassy systems remains an open challenge. Over the last decade, machine learning (ML) strategies have emerged as an important tool for probing this structure-dynamics relationship, particularly for predicting heterogeneous glassy dynamics from local structure. A recent advancement is the introduction of the \textit{cage state}, a structural quantity that captures the most likely positions of particles while rearrangements are forbidden. During the caging regime, linear models trained on the cage state have been shown to outperform more complex ML methods trained on initial configurations alone. In this paper, we explore the properties associated with the cage state in more detail to better understand why it serves as such an effective predictor for the dynamics. Specifically, we examine how the cage state in a binary hard-sphere mixture is influenced by both packing fraction and boundary conditions. Our results reveal that, as the system approaches the glassy regime, the cage state becomes increasingly influenced by long-range structural effects. This influence is evident both in its predictive power for particle dynamics and in the internal structure of the cage state, suggesting that the CS might be associated with some form of an amorphous growing structural length scale.

We study one-dimensional metal halide perovskite crystals encapsulated in single-wall nanotubes, so-called picoperovskites, using optical spectroscopy. Polarized micro-photoluminescence (PL) reveals bright emission from aligned bundles of picoperovskites with clear linear polarization along the bundle axis. This emission is red-shifted with respect to bulk perovskite samples using the same constituents. Temperature-dependent, time-resolved micro-PL shows extraordinarily long PL lifetimes of the picoperovskites at low temperatures, reaching several hundred nanoseconds and exceeding those of bulk perovskites by two orders of magnitude.

Van der Waals (vdW) crystals are prone to twisting, sliding, and buckling due to inherently weak interlayer interactions. While thickness-controlled vdW structures have attracted considerable attention as ultrathin semiconducting channels, the deterministic synthesis of stacking-fault-free multilayers remains a persistent challenge. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of single-crystalline hexagonal bilayer MoS<sub>2</sub>, enabled by the incorporation of Mo interstitials between layers during layer-by-layer deposition. The resulting bilayers exhibit exceptional structural robustness, maintaining their crystallinity and suppressing both rotational and translational interlayer misalignments even after transfer processes. Atomic-resolution analysis reveals that the Mo interstitials are located at a single sublattice site within the hexagonal lattice, where they form tetrahedral bonds with sulfur atoms from both MoS<sub>2</sub> layers, effectively anchoring the interlayer registry. Density functional theory calculations further indicate that these Mo atoms act as nucleation centers, promoting the selective formation of the hexagonal bilayer phase. This approach offers a robust strategy for the deterministic growth of multilayer vdW crystals with precisely controlled stacking order and enhanced interlayer coupling.

Kay Hofmann, Kay-Robert Dormann, Benno Liebchen, Friederike Schmid
In simulations of colloidal matter, frictional contacts between particles are often neglected. For spherical colloids, such an approximation can be problematic, since frictional contacts couple translational and rotational degrees of freedom, which may affect the collective behavior of, e.g., colloids under shear and chiral active matter. Deterministic models for frictional contacts have been proposed in the granular matter community. On the colloidal scale, however, thermal fluctuations are important and should be included in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Here, we derive the correct fluctuation-dissipation relation for linear and nonlinear instantaneous frictional contact interactions. Among other, this generates a new generalized class of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) thermostats with rotation-translation coupling. We demonstrate effects of frictional contact interactions using the examples of Poiseuille flow and motility induced phase separation in active Langevin particles.

[36]. [*Defect-Mediated Melting of Square-Lattice Solids*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16418 "Defect-Mediated Melting of Square-Lattice Solids")
William Grampel, Daniel Podolsky
The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory successfully explains the melting mechanism of two-dimensional isotropic lattices as a two-step process driven by the unbinding of topological defects. By considering the elastic theory of the square lattice, we extend the KTHNY theory to melting of square lattice solids. In addition to the familiar elastic constants that govern the theory -- the Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio -- a third constant controlling the anisotropy of the medium emerges. This modifies both the logarithmic and angular interactions between the topological defects. Despite this modification, the extended theory retains the qualitative features of the isotropic case, predicting a two-step melting with an intermediate tetratic phase. However, some subtle differences arise, including a modified bound on the translational correlation exponent and the absence of universal values for the Young's modulus at the solid-to-tetratic phase transition.

\'Angel L. Corps, Armando Rela\~no
We report the existence of a large set of ferromagnetic scarred states in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions, in a regime with no ferromagnetic phase at finite temperature. These scarred states are distributed over different spectral regions, surrounded by paramagnetic states. We show that simple initial conditions, consisting in a few small magnetic domains, selectively populate these scarred states. This leads to the appearance of a special dynamical phase, which we call scarred ferromagnetic phase. As a consequence, initial states with a small number of small magnetic domains evolve towards ferromagnetic equilibrium states, whereas initial states with larger domains or no magnetic structure relax to the expected thermal paramagnetic equilibrium state.

Tunable monochromatic magneto-transmission is one of the most established magneto-optical techniques, particularly well suited for pulsed magnetic fields. It employs fixed-wavelength monochromatic light as the probe, while the magnetic field is swept to bring the sample into resonance with the photon energy. The key component of this setup is a tunable laser system, typically consisting of a Ti:sapphire laser coupled with an optical parametric oscillator. However, such laser systems are often bulky, expensive, and inherently unstable, which significantly limits their widespread application in magneto-optical laboratories. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy, cost-effective, and compact tunable monochromatic magneto-transmission system based on a combination of a laser-driven white light source and a mini monochromator, and demonstrate its feasibility and performance in a millisecond-range pulsed magnetic field condition. To verify the accuracy of this new and simplified setup, we performed Faraday rotation measurements on the geometrically frustrated spin system CdCr2O4, as well as magneto-transmission experiments on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice antiferromagnet SrCu2(BO3)2. These results show excellent agreement with previous reports, confirming the reliability and precision of the new setup.

The concept of pseudo-spin provides a general framework for describing physical systems featuring two-component spinors, including light polarization, sublattice degrees of freedom in bipartite lattices, and valley polarization in 2D materials. In all cases, the pseudo-spin can be mapped to a Stokes vector on the Poincar\'e sphere. Stokes polarimeters for measuring the polarization of light are a powerful tool with a wide range of applications both in classical and quantum science. Generalizing Stokes polarimetry to other spinor degrees of freedom is thus a challenge of prime importance. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a Stokes polarimeter for the sublattice polarization in a bipartite photonic lattice. Our method relies on k-space photoluminescence intensity measurements under controlled phase shifts and attenuations applied independently to each sublattice. We implement our method using honeycomb arrays of coupled microcavities realizing photonic analogs of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. Using our sublattice polarimeter, we reconstruct the Bloch modes in amplitude and phase across the Brillouin zone, achieving sub-linewidth precision in the determination of their eigenenergies, including near band touching points. This enables full access to the system Bloch Hamiltonian and quantum geometric tensor. Our approach can readily be extended to more complex systems with additional internal degrees of freedom, enabling experimental investigations of trigonal warping, Chern insulating phases, and Euler-class topology in multigap systems.

Excitons are bosonic quasiparticles with a variety of applications in optoelectronics, photosyn thesis, and dissipationless informatics, and their lifetime can become sufficiently long to form a quantum condensate. While exciton condensation has been predicted to occur as a ground state of a solid, so called an excitonic insulator, whose material realization has been elusive. Here we report the observation of direct photoemission signals from excitons in a ground state of a very recent excitonic insulator candidate Ta2Pd3Te5 below its metal-insulator transition temperature using orbital-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the excitons have a lower energy than the valence band maximum to possibly drive the phase transition. This measurement further discloses the size and the unusual odd parity of the exciton wave function. The present finding opens an avenue toward applications of coherent excitons in solid systems and searching for exotic quantum phases of exciton condensates.

We investigate the quantum phase diagram of an ``odd'' variant of the two-dimensional Ising Fradkin--Shenker model, characterized by a uniform background of static $e$ and $m$ charges. Using large-scale tensor network and exact diagonalization methods, we determine the topology of the phase diagram, identifying an ``odd'' deconfined phase, confinement- and Higgs-induced valence bond solids (VBS), and a trivial paramagnet. Most notably, we uncover an exotic multicritical point along the self-dual line, where electric and magnetic excitations are related by an enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2$ duality. This transition is marked by the simultaneous onset of confinement, Higgs condensation, translational symmetry breaking, and spontaneous duality symmetry breaking. Within our numerical accuracy, the transition appears continuous, involving the softening of excitation gaps for $e$ and $m$ anyons at finite momentum. At intermediate couplings, we further identify VBS phases with enlarged unit cells, potentially indicating frustration-induced crystalline order beyond commensurate limits.

Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits remarkable electronic properties under external magnetic fields, notably the emergence of flat Landau levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles, i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.

Understanding transport in interacting quantum many-body systems is a central challenge in condensed matter and statistical physics. Numerical studies typically rely on two main approaches: Dynamics of linear-response functions in closed systems and Markovian dynamics governed by master equations for boundary-driven open systems. While the equivalence of their dynamical behavior has been explored in recent studies, a systematic comparison of the transport coefficients obtained from these two classes of methods remains an open question. Here, we address this gap by comparing and contrasting the dc diffusion constant $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ computed from the aforementioned two approaches. We find a clear mismatch between the two, with $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ exhibiting a strong dependence on the system-bath coupling for the boundary-driven technique, highlighting fundamental limitations of such a method in calculating the transport coefficients related to asymptotic dynamical behavior of the system. We trace the origin of this mismatch to the incorrect order of limits of time $t \rightarrow \infty$ and system size $L\rightarrow \infty$, which we argue to be intrinsic to boundary-driven setups. As a practical resolution, we advocate computing only time-dependent transport coefficients within the boundary-driven framework, which show excellent agreement with those obtained from the Kubo formalism based on closed-system dynamics, up to a timescale set by the system size. This leads us to interpret the sensitivity of the dc diffusion constant on the system-bath coupling strength in an open system as a potential diagnostic for finite-size effects.

Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can simulate large molecular complexes over extended timescales by reducing degrees of freedom. A critical step in CG modeling is the selection of the CG mapping algorithm, which directly influences both accuracy and interpretability of the model. Despite progress, the optimal strategy for coarse-graining remains a challenging task, highlighting the necessity for a comprehensive theoretical framework. In this work, we present a graph-based coarsening approach to develop CG models. Coarse-grained sites are obtained through edge contractions, where nodes are merged based on a local variational cost metric while preserving key spectral properties of the original graph. Furthermore, we illustrate how Message Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE) can be applied to generate ML-CG potentials that are not only highly efficient but also accurate. Our approach provides a bottom-up, theoretically grounded computational method for the development of systematically improvable CG potentials.

In-plane Hall effect (IPHE) triggered by an external magnetic field applied in the transport plane has attracted significant experimental attentions in recent few years 1-6. However, most experiments focus on magnetic materials, where the existence of magnetic ordering may complicate understanding the physics behind, and the relatively small signal magnitudes limit the application of the effect. Here, we report a giant IPHE in a nonmagnetic half-Heusler compound LuAuSn, with a magnitude exceeding all the previously reported values. A -period of IPHE and the consistent cubic dependence on the magnetic field are observed, realizing the long-sought theoretical prediction of magneto-cubic IPHE under threefold rotational symmetry7-9 in an unexpected material. The scaling law analysis and first-principles calculations indicate that extrinsic side jump and skew scattering processes from both impurity and phonon scatterings dominate the observed effect. These findings unravel a new type of magneto-nonlinear IPHE, and its large magnitude and wide-temperature operation may open the door to practical applications of IPHE.

Tsuyoshi Okubo, Joji Nasu, Takahiro Misawa, Yukitoshi Motome
We investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev model with additional interactions under a magnetic field, employing a finite-temperature tensor network method benchmarked by a thermal pure quantum state technique. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature, $\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer quantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature. Moreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\kappa_{xy}/T$ is consistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana fermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the additional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^{\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we show that positive $\Gamma$ and negative $\Gamma^{\prime}$ lead to a remarkable enhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with the classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\Gamma$ term go beyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation effects, while those of the $\Gamma^\prime$ term are well captured at the classical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced thermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from topological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the critical field. Our approach not only establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the thermal Hall transport in Kitaev materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, but also offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theories and experiments across a wide range of strongly correlated materials.

Silicon offers great promise as a potential anode active material and the optimum alternative to lithium metal in all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries. However, its practical application is limited by severe volume expansion (~300%) during lithiation, leading to cracking upon delithiation. In this study, we investigated the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon electrodes in a solid-electrolyte-free environment using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) during electrochemical cycling. A controlled workflow prevents ambient exposure, and cryo-TEM ensures structural integrity. After the first lithiation, the electrode shows a heterogeneous mix of crystalline Li15Si4, various amorphous LixSi phases, and residual crystalline silicon. After delithiation, the structure becomes predominantly amorphous with thread-like features and minimal remaining crystallinity. By the 10th delithiation, the microstructure is more uniform, with thread-like regions mainly at grain boundaries. Our results reveal that starting from a crystalline phase, a stationary microstructure emerges in bulk silicon only after several cycles. Thus, to have a more controlled behavior of the electrode and minimize cracking, the starting material should be carefully chosen along with an optimized electrode architecture to help stabilize the microstructure throughout cycling.

Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.

The unique electrical and optical properties of emerging two-dimensional transition metal dichal-cogenides (TMDs) present compelling advantages over conventional semiconductors, including Si, Ge, and GaAs. Nevertheless, realising the full potential of TMDs in electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as transistors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and photodetectors, is con-strained by high contact resistance. This limitation arises from their low intrinsic carrier concen-trations and the current insufficiency of doping strategies for atomically thin materials. Notably, chemical treatment with 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) has been demonstrated as an effective post-growth method to enhance the n-type electrical conductivity of TMDs. Despite the well-documented electrical improvements post-DCE treatment, its effects on optical properties, specifically the retention of optical characteristics and excitonic behaviour, are not yet clearly under-stood. Here, we systematically investigate the layer- and time-dependent optical effects of DCE on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations. Our PL results reveal a rapid reduction in the indirect bandgap transition, with the direct transition remaining unaffected. DFT confirms that chlorine (Cl) atoms bind to sulphur vacancies, creating mid-gap states that facilitate non-radiative recom-bination, explaining the observed indirect PL suppression. This work demonstrates DCE's utility not only for n-type doping but also for optical band structure engineering in MoS2 by selec-tively suppressing indirect transitions, potentially opening new avenues for 2D optoelectronic device design.

Dual lattices such as honeycomb and hexagonal lattices typically obey Babinet's principle in optics, which states that the expected interference patterns of two complementary diffracting objects are identical and indistinguishable, except for their overall intensity. Here, we study Kapitza--Dirac diffraction of Bose--Einstein condensates in optical lattices and find that matter waves in dual lattices obey Babinet's principle only under the condition of weak-pulse Raman--Nath regimes. In contrast, the Kapitza--Dirac matter-wave diffraction in the strong-pulse Raman--Nath regime (corresponding to the phase wrapping method we developed to generate sub-wavelength phase structures in Sci. Rep. 10, 5870 (2020)) can break Babinet's principle and clearly resolve the distinct interference patterns of the dual honeycomb and hexagonal lattices. This method offers exceptional precision in characterizing lattice configurations and advance the study of symmetry-related phenomena, overcoming the limitations of real-space imaging.

Sayan Ghosh, Anirudha Menon, Manoranjan Kumar, Rajiv R. P. Singh
Rare-earth material TmVO$_4$ shows ferro-quadrupolar order below a critical temperature which can be tuned by various parameters such as a magnetic field, a strain field, chemical composition, and nuclear spin coupling to its non-Kramers electronic doublets. In this work, we study a pseudo-spin-1/2 model to understand the various phases in TmVO$_4$. The model captures coupled electronic and nuclear orders via (i) a ferro-quadrupolar Jahn-Teller interaction, (ii) a $B_{1g}$ shear strain, (iii) a transverse magnetic field, and (iv) a weak on-site nuclear hyperfine coupling A. At zero transverse magnetic and strain fields, electronic quadrupoles undergo a second-order transition at $T_Q$, lowering the entropy per site from ln 4 to ln 2. At a much lower $T_N$ ~ $A^2/T_Q$, virtual electronic fluctuations mediate an effective nuclear-spin Ising interaction, driving a second transition that collapses the remaining entropy. Under a transverse magnetic field, nuclear moments polarize smoothly, replacing the sharp low-T transition by a crossover. In contrast, adiabatic $B_{1g}$ strain sweeps across the two ordering temperatures yielding a pronounced two-step elastocaloric effect, highlighting TmVO$_4$ as a tunable strain-driven solid-state refrigerant.

Hui Sun, Shun-Li Shang, Shuang Lin, Jingjing Li, Allison M. Beese, Zi-Kui Liu
Thermodynamic descriptions of all binaries within the Cr-Fe-Mo-Nb-Ni system have been complied and, where necessary, remodeled. Notably, the Cr-Fe and Fe-Mo systems have been remodeled using comprehensive sublattice models for the topologically close-packed (TCP) phases of Laves_C14, sigma, and mu according to their Wyckoff positions. These refinements are supported by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), in conjunction with available experimental data in the literature. The resulting models offer improved accuracy in describing the TCP phases. For instance, the predicted site occupancies of sigma in Cr-Fe show excellent agreement with experimental observations. The present work provides a robust foundation for CALPHAD modeling and the design of complex, multi-component materials, particularly those based on Fe-based and Ni-based alloys.

Phase transitions are governed by both intrinsic and extrinsic heterogeneities, yet capturing their spatio-temporal dynamics remains a challenge. While ultrafast techniques track phase changes on femtosecond timescales, the spatial complexity and stochastic nature of the processes often remain hidden. Here, we present an experimental approach that combines well-established ultrafast hard-X-ray diffraction with a propagating strain pulse as a universal and non-invasive probe. This ultrafast X-ray sonography can capture the spatio-temporal phase heterogeneity in great detail by resolving the phase-specific strain response. We apply this approach to the antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic magneto-structural phase transition in FeRh and identify the ferromagnetic phase to nucleate at the surface as narrow columnar domains of approximately $30\,\text{nm}$ diameter. Besides reconciling the diverse experimental results in the literature on FeRh, X-ray sonography offers a versatile platform for investigating a wide range of phase transitions accompanied by structural changes.

[54]. [*Asymmetric trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16643 "Asymmetric trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides")
Arthur Christianen, Atac Imamoglu
Exciton spectroscopy serves as a sensitive probe of electronic states in two-dimensional semiconductors. A prominent feature in optical spectra is the trion peak arising from the binding of a charge carrier to an exciton. The splitting between the exciton and trion peaks is usually interpreted as the trion binding energy, but we theoretically show that this view is incomplete. Since dark excitons are more strongly bound than the bright exciton, the trion wave function is asymmetric and a large contribution to the measured splitting is the difference between the bright and dark exciton binding energies. Our model quantitatively explains the measured trion energies in MoSe2 and WSe2, demonstrating the importance of the internal structure of the exciton for the interpretation of the optical response of transition metal dichalcogenides.

Emmy Blumenthal
Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) is a powerful theoretical framework for analyzing systems with many interacting degrees of freedom. This tutorial provides an accessible introduction to DMFT. We begin with a linear model where the DMFT equations can be derived exactly, allowing readers to develop clear intuition for the underlying principles. We then introduce the cavity method, a versatile approach for deriving DMFT equations for non-linear systems. The tutorial concludes with an application to the generalized Lotka--Volterra model of interacting species, demonstrating how DMFT reduces the complex dynamics of many-species communities to a tractable single-species stochastic process. Key insights include understanding how quenched disorder enables the reduction from many-body to effective single-particle dynamics, recognizing the role of self-averaging in simplifying complex systems, and seeing how collective interactions give rise to non-Markovian feedback effects.

Monolayer (1L) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a unique opportunity to control the valley degree of freedom of optically excited charge carriers due to the spin-valley locking effect. Despite extensive studies of the valley-contrasting physics, stimulated by perspective valleytronic applications, a unified picture of competing intervalley coupling processes in 1L-TMDs is lacking. Here, we apply broadband helicity-resolved transient absorption to explore exciton valley polarization dynamics in 1L-WSe${}_2$. By combining experimental results with microscopic simulations, we dissect individual intervalley coupling mechanisms and reveal the crucial role of phonon-assisted scattering in the fast decay of the A exciton circular dichroism and the formation of the dichroism of opposite polarity for the B exciton. We further provide a consistent description of the valley depolarization driven by the combined action of Coulomb scattering processes and indicate the presence of efficient single spin-flip mechanisms. Our study brings us closer to a complete understanding of exciton dynamics in TMDs.

Nagamalleswararao Dasari, Hugo U. R. Strand, Martin Eckstein, Alexander I. Lichtenstein, Evgeny A. Stepanov
Conductivity is one of the most direct probes of electronic systems, yet its theoretical description remains challenging in the presence of strong non-local correlations. In this Letter, we analyze the conductivity of the half-filled single-band Hubbard model and identify the role of spatial correlations across the Mott transition. We show that in the correlated metallic regime, an accurate description of the conductivity requires not only the correct spectral function but also the inclusion of complex multi-electron processes encoded in vertex corrections. The crossover to the Mott insulating regime is marked by a vanishing contribution of vertex corrections to the DC conductivity. However, in the Mott insulating case, vertex corrections remain significant for the optical conductivity.

Huimin Zhu, Yuhua Ren, Hui Pan, Gaomin Tang, Lei Zhang, Jian-Sheng Wang
Time modulation introduces a dynamic degree of freedom for tailoring thermal radiation beyond the limits of static materials. Here we investigate far-field thermal radiation from a periodically time-modulated SiC film under the Floquet nonequilibrium Green's function framework. We show that time modulation enables radiative energy transfer into the far field that surpasses the limit imposed by the equilibrium thermal fluctuations. This enhancement originates from the modulation-induced coupling between evanescent surface phonon polaritons and propagating modes, effectively bridging the energy and momentum mismatch through frequency conversion. Notably, even at zero temperature, the film emits a finite radiative heat flux due to nonequilibrium photon occupation generated by the modulation. The radiative output grows with increasing modulation strength, highlighting the role of external work in driving far-field emission. These results establish time modulation as an effective mechanism for bridging near-field and far-field regimes, opening new pathways for active thermal radiation control.

Joseph L. Spellberg, Lina Kodaimati, Atreyie Ghosh, Prakriti P. Joshi, Sarah B. King
Crystalline phase transitions in two-dimensional materials enable precise control over electronic and ferroic properties, making them attractive materials for memory and energy storage applications. In$_2$Se$_3$ is particularly promising because its $\alpha$ and $\beta'$ phases are both stable at room temperature but exhibit distinct ferroic behaviors. However, achieving reliable reversible switching between these states remains challenging. Here, we show that controlled $\beta'\rightarrow\alpha$ phase transitions in 2D In$_2$Se$_3$ become accessible through laser-induced wrinkling, establishing a room-temperature approach for manipulating ferroic states in In$_2$Se$_3$ thin films. Combined with thermal annealing for phase recovery, this approach eliminates cryogenic steps and mechanical perturbation while harnessing accumulated internal strain to generate multiphase heterostructures and direct domain reorganization. This pathway for phase transitions in In$_2$Se$_3$ opens the door for further development in ferroic device architectures and phase-change memory technologies.

Sameh Okasha, Stephen McVitie, Trevor P. Almeida
Focused electron-beam induced deposition (FEBID) has emerged as a powerful technique for shifting from direct-write fabrication of two- to three-dimensional nanostructures, which reflects a broader movement across nanotechnology as a whole. Fields such as nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, and energy storage and harvesting are poised to benefit from a new generation of greener, more versatile, and multifunctional technologies enabled by this transition to 3D structures. The availability of numerous precursors enables the deposition of a wide range of materials, including metallic, organic, semiconducting, magnetic, and superconductors. While materials fabricated using FEBID typically contain significant amounts of impurities, several strategies have been developed to achieve high purity. These include the synthesis of new precursors, optimizing growth conditions, introducing reactive gases during the growth process, and post-deposition purification techniques.Although iron (Fe)-based deposits are gaining particular interest due to their potential applications in nanomagnetism and spintronics, FEBID of Fe has not developed significantly due to several challenges, mainly controlling the e-beam reaction with Fe precursors which often results in low yield growth due to a slow dissociation reaction. This work advances the controlled FEBID of complex 3D Fe nanostructures by further refining the spatial dwell-time resolution map to print complex structures within nm feature accuracy, through quantitatively calibrating Monte Carlo simulations with the measured experimental growth profiles. The methodology, visualized in 3D graphs, enables high shape fidelity in Fe growth and maintains the ongoing growth across multiple complex structures through predictive tuning of model parameters based on input geometry, an outcome that was previously unachievable for Fe.

Bao-Feng Chen, Jie-Xiang Yu, Gen Yin
$\alpha\textrm{-MnTe}$ is a p-type semiconducting altermagnet with a N\'eel temperature near 300K. Due to the strong spin-orbit coupling and the altermagnetic symmetry, Kramers degeneracy is lifted in the valence band maxima along the $\Gamma$-K line and the A point. However, the energy difference is found to be small, and any small shift in the spectrum can dramatically change the overall transport behavior. Here we show that a strain modulating the [0001] axis of the unit cell by $\sim\pm0.5\%$ can significantly change the transport signature, switching the thermal window between the two regions of the valence band. When the $\Gamma$-K line is dominating, the planar Hall effect and the anisotropic magnetoresistance can be modulated by an order of magnitude, with the maximum up to $\sim30\%$.

Shuo Zhang, Langxuan Chen, Pengfei Zhang
The rapid advancement of quantum science and technology has established Rydberg atom arrays as a premier platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with exceptional precision and controllability. Traditionally, each atom is modeled as a spin degree of freedom with its spatial motion effectively frozen. This simplification has facilitated the discovery of a rich variety of novel equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases, including $\mathbb{Z}_{\text{N}}$ symmetry-breaking orders and quantum scars. In this work, we investigate the consequences of incorporating atomic vibrations in optical tweezers, which give rise to spin-phonon coupling. For systems in thermal equilibrium, we find that this coupling leads to a new symmetry-breaking phase in the weak driving limit, as a result of induced three-spin interactions. Furthermore, we show that the violation of quantum thermalization in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered states is suppressed when spin-phonon coupling is introduced. Our results are readily testable in state-of-the-art Rydberg atom array experiments.

Nileema Sharma, Matthew Toole, James McKenzie, Sheng Ran, Xiaolong Liu
In a Josephson junction involving multi-band superconductors, competition between inter-band and inter-junction Josephson coupling gives rise to frustration and spatial disjunction of superfluid densities among superconducting condensates. Such frustrated coupling manifests as quantum interference of Josephson currents from different tunneling channels and becomes tunable if channel transparency can be varied. To explore these unconventional effects in the prototypical $s^\pm$-wave superconductor FeSe, we use atomic resolution scanned Josephson tunneling microscopy SJTM for condensate resolved imaging and junction tuning -- capabilities unattainable in macroscopic Josephson devices with fixed characteristics. We quantitatively demonstrate frustrated Josephson tunneling by examining two tunneling inequalities. The relative transparency of two parallel tunneling pathways is found tunable, revealing a tendency towards a 0-pi transition with decreasing SJTM junction resistance. Simultaneous visualization of both superconducting condensates reveals anti correlated superfluid modulations, highlighting the role of inter-band scattering. Our study establishes SJTM as a powerful tool enabling new research frontiers of multi condensate superconductivity.

Alessio Ciamei, Adam Koza, Marcin Gronowski, Micha{\l} Tomza
We propose high-spin $\Sigma$-state polar molecules assembled from ultracold atoms to probe charge-parity violating physics beyond the Standard Model. We identify YbCr as a prime candidate to search for the electric dipole moment of the electron. We show that the combination of relativistic ytterbium and high-spin chromium, amenable to magneto-association, leads to molecules with easy-to-polarize parity doublets and large intramolecular electric fields. Based on \textit{ab initio} results for molecular constants, we predict a sensitivity of $\delta d_{\textrm{e}}= ( 6 \times 10^{-31} / \sqrt{n_{\mathrm{day}}})\,e\,\mathrm{cm}$ via standard spin-precession measurements, we assess the experimental feasibility, and discuss potential extensions to more advanced quantum control as well as searches of the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment. This work paves the way to next-generation searches for new physics with ultracold molecules in both the leptonic and hadronic sectors.

[65]. [*Generalized non-reciprocal phase transitions in multipopulation systems*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16763 "Generalized non-reciprocal phase transitions in multipopulation systems")
Cheyne Weis, Ryo Hanai
Non-reciprocal interactions are prevalent in various complex systems leading to phenomena that cannot be described by traditional equilibrium statistical physics. Although non-reciprocally interacting systems composed of two populations have been closely studied, the physics of non-reciprocal systems with a general number of populations is not well explored despite the potential relevance to biological systems, active matter, and driven-dissipative quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the generic features of the phases and phase transitions that emerge in $O(2)$ symmetric many-body systems with multiple non-reciprocally coupled populations, applicable to microscopic models such as networks of oscillators, flocking models, and more generally systems where each agent has a phase variable. Using symmetry and topology of the possible orbits, we systematically show that a rich variety of time-dependent phases and phase transitions arise. Examples include multipopulation chiral phases that are distinct from their two-population counterparts that emerge via a phase transition characterized by critical exceptional points, as well as limit cycle saddle-node bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation. Interestingly, we find a phase transition that dynamically restores the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry occurs via a homoclinic orbit bifurcation, where the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ broken orbits merge at the phase transition point, providing a general route to homoclinic chaos in the order parameter dynamics for $N\geq4$ populations. The results contribute to the understanding of the novel collective behavior and provide formalism for classifying dynamic phases and their transitions in systems driven by non-reciprocal interactions.

Wenhui Tang, Mehrana R. Nejad, Adrian F. Pegoraro, L. Mahadevan, Ming Guo
Collective cell migration lies at the intersection of developmental biology and non-equilibrium physics, where active processes give rise to emergent patterns that are biologically relevant. Here, we investigate dilatational modes--cycles of expansion and contraction--in epithelial monolayers, and show that the divergence of the velocity field exhibits robust, large-scale temporal oscillations. These oscillatory patterns, reminiscent of excitable media and their biological analogs, emerge spontaneously from the coupled dynamics of actively pulsing cells. We find that the temporal persistence of these oscillations varies non-monotonically with cell density: synchrony initially increases with density, reaches a maximum at intermediate densities and is lost at higher values. This trend mirrors changes in the spatial correlation length of cell-cell interactions, and the density of topological defects in the system, suggesting a shared physical origin. We develop a continuum model in which a complex-valued Ginzburg-Landau-type field that governs the amplitude and phase of oscillations is coupled to local cell density. Simulations reproduce the observed behavior, revealing that local density adapts to phase patterns, reinforcing temporal coherence up to a critical density, and variations in the density of topological defects as a function of cell density. Extending our analysis to breast cancer cell lines with increasing invasiveness, we find that malignant cells exhibit longer phase persistence and fewer topological defects, suggesting a mechanistic link between temporal coherence and metastatic potential. Together, these results highlight the role of density-dependent synchrony dynamics as a fundamental, quantifiable mode of collective behavior in active epithelial matter, with implications for morphogenesis, cancer progression, and tissue diagnostics.

[67]. [*Systematic Improvement of Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15941 "Systematic Improvement of Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory")
Ekrem Demiray, Kara Farnsworth, Rachel Houtz
Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory is a framework that aims to improve the results of Hamiltonian truncation in a systematic, order-by-order fashion using Effective Field Theory methodology. The result is a truncated effective Hamiltonian with corrections that result from a matching procedure. We establish the rigor of this method by calculating nontrival next-to-leading order corrections in a $1/E_{\rm max}$ expansion, where $E_{\rm max}$ is our effective theory cutoff. We illustrate this explicitly using 1+1D $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, calculating corrections up to order $1/E_{\rm max}^3$. At this order, novel nonlocal contributions to the matching conditions must be incorporated. We show that by including these nonlocal terms, the error scales as $1/E_{\rm max}^4$, as expected from the Effective Field Theory power counting, providing a nontrivial check that this method is consistent and robust. We also estimate the critical coupling at which this theory flows to the 2D Ising conformal field theory and confirm that separation of scales, an essential feature of Effective Field Theory, persists at this order. These results establish Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory as a generic, systematic framework for improving convergence in Hamiltonian truncation and lay the groundwork to apply this method to more complex systems in higher dimensions.

Nicol\`o Beato, Gianluca Teza
A fundamental problem in experiments with open quantum systems is to ensure steady-state convergence within a given operational time window. Here, we devise a general state preparation recipe to control relaxation timescales and achieve steady-state convergence within experimental run times. We do so by constructing a unitary operation that cancels the desired relaxation modes. We provide an example in a few-body interacting system (long-range qubit chain), taking into account limitations of experimentally accessible unitary operations in quantum simulators.

[69]. [*Topological control of quantum speed limits*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15950 "Topological control of quantum speed limits")
Alexander Kruchkov
Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a measure quantifying the sensitivity of a quantum state with respect to changes in tuning parameters in quantum metrology, and defining quantum speed limits. We show that even if the quantum state is completely dispersionless, QFI in this state remains momentum-resolved. We compute the QFI for topological phases at integer filling and demonstrate that each momentum-resolved term is fundamentally bounded by quantum geometric and topological invariants, with maximum QFI controlled by topological invariants (Chern number $|C|$). We also finds bounds on quantum speed limit which scales as $\sqrt{|C|}$ in a (dispersionless) topological phase. We conclude that quantum platforms of high Chern numbers $|C| \gg 1$, such as those featuring twisted multilayered van der Waals heterostructures, significantly enhance capacity for quantum Fisher information, and provide practical control over quantum speed limits.

G. L. Alfimov, P. A. Korchagin, F. K. Abdullaev
We study nonlinear excitations described by DNLS-type equations with so-called competing nonlinearities. These are the nonlinearities that consist of two power terms with coefficients of different sign. A key feature of these models is the presence of two governing parameters: $\alpha$, which characterizes the coupling between lattice sites, and $\gamma$, which quantifies the balance between competing nonlinearities. Our study focuses on intrinsic localized modes (ILMs) -- solutions that exhibit spatial localization over a few lattice sites. The basic example for our study is the cubic-quartic equation that recently has been used to describe 3D BEC cloud in the mean field approximation with Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. We employ numerical continuation from the anti-continuum limit (ACL) where the coupling between the lattice sites is neglected (the case $\alpha=0$). We analyze $\alpha$-dependent branches of the basic ILMs and their bifurcations when $\gamma$ varies. Our study shows that all branches of ILMs originated at anti-continuum limit, except a finite number, bifurcate and do not exist for large values of $\alpha$. We present tables of bifurcations for the ILMs that involve not more than 3 excited lattice sites. It is shown that the model supports nonsymmetric ILMs that have no counterparts in ACL. Also we study the branches of ILMs that can be continued unlimitedly when $\alpha\to \infty$ (called here $\infty$-branches). It was found that for any $\gamma$ there are exactly two (up to symmetries) $\infty$-branches. When $\gamma$ grows these branches undergo a sequence of bifurcations. Finally, we compare our results with the results for the quadratic-cubic equation and the cubic-quintic equation and found no qualitative difference in (a) tables of bifurcations, (b) presence of solutions without ACL counterpart and (c) scenario of switching of $\infty$-branches.

This short note shows that the recently proposed generating function for loop hafnians -- originally derived using quantum-optical methods for a restricted class of matrices -- is in fact valid for arbitrary symmetric matrices. The proof relies solely on Gaussian integration and does not assume any additional properties inherited from the covariance matrices of quantum Gaussian states.

[72]. [*Noise-Induced Collective Memory in Schooling Fish*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16102 "Noise-Induced Collective Memory in Schooling Fish")
Alyssa Chan, Eva Kanso
Schooling fish often self-organize into a variety of collective patterns, from polarized schooling to rotational milling. Mathematical models support the emergence of these large-scale patterns from local decentralized interactions, in the absence of individual memory and group leadership. In a popular model where individual fish interact locally following rules of avoidance, alignment, and attraction, the group exhibits collective memory: changes in individual behavior lead to emergent patterns that depend on the group's past configurations. However, the mechanisms driving this collective memory remain obscure. Here, we combine numerical simulations with tools from bifurcation theory to uncover that the transition from milling to schooling in this model is driven by a noisy transcritical bifurcation where the two collective states intersect and exchange stability. We further show that key features of the group dynamics - the bifurcation character, transient milling, and collective memory - can be captured by a phenomenological model of the group polarization. Our findings demonstrate that collective memory arises from a noisy bifurcation rather than from structural bistability, thus resolving a long-standing ambiguity about its origins and contributing fundamental understanding to collective phase transitions in a prevalent model of fish schooling.

Hidetsugu Sakaguchi, Boris A. Malomed
We introduce a model governing the copropagation of two components which represent circular polarizations of light in the optical fiber with relative strength g = 2 of the nonlinear repulsion between the components, and linear coupling between them. A more general system of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations, with g =/= 2 and the linear mixing between the components, is considered too. The latter system is introduced in its one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) forms. A new finding is the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of bimodal CW (continuous-wave) states in the case of g > 1 (in the absence of the linear coupling, it corresponds to the immiscibility of the nonlinearly interacting components). The SSB is represented by an exact asymmetric CW solution. An exact solution is also found, in the case of g = 3, for stable dark solitons (DSs) supported by the asymmetric CW background. For g =/= 3, numerical solutions are produced for stable DSs supported by the same background. Moreover, we identify a parameter domain where the fully miscible (symmetric) CW background maintains stable DSs with the inner SSB (separation between the components) in its core. In 2D, the GP system produces stable vortex states with a shift between the components and broken isotropy. The vortices include ones with the inter-component shift imposed by the asymmetric CW background, and states supported by the symmetric background, in which the intrinsic shift (splitting) is exhibited by vortical cores of the two components.

Tasawar Iqbal, Catherine Penington, Christian Thomas, Lyndon Koens
An asymptotic approach is employed to study the swimming speed of a two-dimensional Taylor swimming sheet beneath a Brinkman layer of finite thickness. This configuration is representative of a swimmer confined within a porous non-Newtonian boundary and could model microscopic filter feeders like choanoflagellates and sponges or the mucociliary escalator in the lungs. When ignoring the effects of jump stress and porosity, the swimming speed of the sheet decreases as the thickness and lower boundary of the Brinkman layer increase. The same is true as the permeability of the layer decreases. Including porosity effects with a zero jump stress enhances the swimming velocity of the sheet for porosity values near unity and decreases the swimming velocity for smaller porosity values. In the absence of porosity, the swimming speed of the sheet increases for positive-valued jump stresses and decreases for negative ones. Coupling nonzero jump stress with a variable porosity establishes complex behavior, with the sheet's swimming speed attaining a maximum, surpassing that found for the Newtonian case, particularly in thin or low-permeability Brinkman layers.

Th\'eotime Girardot
We show that a 2-dimensional system of N fermions interacting through a pairwise electric and magnetic singular interactions with Slater initial data preserves its Slater structure over time when N gets large. In other words, the wave function of the system can be approximated by a Slater determinant whose orbitals evolves according to a coupled system of N Chern-Simons- Schr\"odinger type effective equations. The result holds in a dilute regime where the density is of order one on a large volume proportional to the number of particles. The pairwise magnetic feature of the system implies to deal with the diagonalization of three-body potentials which is the main mathematical innovation of the paper.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties. Despite these advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability, and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization. Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials, processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance. Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent, data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.

Topological materials, known for their edge states robust against local perturbations, hold promise for next-generation quantum technologies, but remain scarce in nature and challenging to realize in static systems. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain is a one-dimensional system for topological phases, although its static control is limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose to use high-frequency monochromatic driving and modulated amplitude pulses to dynamically induce and switch the Floquet topological phases. Using a Kramers-Henneberger-like transformation, we encode all Floquet sidebands into a single effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that both monochromatic and experimental pulse protocols (Gaussian and fast-beating envelopes) can induce topological edge states, enabling dynamic phase switching. Notably, fast-beating modulations require significantly lower field strengths than monochromatic ones, especially with larger inter-dimer separations. Our findings offer an experimentally feasible route for Floquet engineering, paving the way for ultrafast and energy efficient control of topological phases in quantum platforms, opening up new possibilities in the field of dynamic quantum materials.

Jos\'e Garre-Rubio, Andr\'as Moln\'ar
We introduce two-dimensional tensor network representations of finite groups carrying a 4-cocycle index. We characterize the associated gapped (2+1)D phases that emerge when these anomalous symmetries act on tensor network ground states. We further develop related tensor network unitaries that generate symmetric states representing (3+1)D symmetry protected topological phases. Although aspects of these constructions have been previously addressed, our contribution unifies them within a single tensor network framework and emphasizes the explicit formulation of local tensor equations encoding global consistency conditions.

Antoine Glicenstein, Daniel Benedicto Orenes, Apoorva Apoorva, Rapha\"el Saint-Jalm, Robin Kaiser
In this letter, we report on the time- and space-resolved measurement of subradiant excited state population in an ultra-cold atomic cloud of 174Yb atoms. We use a depletion imaging technique that exploits the V-type internal energy structure of alkaline-earth-like atoms to directly observe the time-resolved spatial distribution of excited state population. We characterize the decay dynamics of the subradiant modes using both the excited state population and scattered light intensity, finding good quantitative agreement with numerical predictions from simulations of two-level atomic ensembles.

Emergent spacetime analogs in condensed matter systems have opened a fascinating window into simulating aspects of gravitational physics in controlled laboratory environments. In this work, we develop a comprehensive nonlinear analog gravity framework within a topological material, incorporating the impact of Berry curvature on the hydrodynamic flow of electrons. Unlike prevalent studies in existing literature limited to linear perturbations, we derive and analyze a fully nonlinear wave equation governing radial perturbations of density and velocity fields, which dynamically generate an effective acoustic metric. Taking the example of graphene as a representative system, and calculating its properties from first principles, we numerically demonstrate the formation of evolving acoustic horizons and quantify analog Hawking temperatures in experimentally accessible regimes. Our findings suggest that topological materials can serve as versatile platforms to probe rich gravitational phenomena, including horizon dynamics and quasi-thermal emission, beyond conventional linear approximations. This work lays the groundwork for exploring nonlinear emergent spacetime in a broad class of quantum materials, bridging condensed matter physics and gravitational analogs.

The ability to inscribe information on single photons at high speeds is a crucial requirement for quantum applications such as quantum communication and measurement-based photonic quantum computation. Nowadays, most experimental implementations employ phase modulators in single-pass, Mach-Zehnder interferometer or Michelson interferometer configurations to encode information on photonic qubits. However, these approaches are intrinsically sensitive to environmental influences, limiting the achievable quantum error rates in practice. We report on the first demonstration of a polarization encoder for single-photon qubits based on a free-space Sagnac interferometer, showcasing inherent phase stability and overcoming previous error rate limitations. Telecom-wavelength single photons emitted by a quantum dot are modulated by the encoder under a repetition rate of 152 MHz. A quantum bit error rate of 0.69(2)% is achieved, marking the lowest error rate reported to date for high-speed information encoding on single photons. This work represents a key advance towards robust, scalable, and low-error quantum information processing with single photon sources.

A commercial Fabry-Perot laser diode is characterized by highly disproportionate dimensions, which poses a significant numerical challenge, even for state-of-the-art tools. This challenge is exacerbated when one of the cavity mirrors is rough-ened, as is the case when fabricating random laser diodes. Such a system involves length scales from several hundred mi-crometres (length) to a few nanometres (roughness) all of which are relevant when studying optical properties in the visi-ble. While involving an extreme range of dimensions, these cavities cannot be treated through statistical approaches such as those used with self-similar fractal structures known to show well-studied properties. Here we deploy numerical meth-ods to compute cavity modes and show how random corrugations of the Fabry-Perot cavity wall affect statistical proper-ties of their spectral features. Our study constitutes a necessary first step in developing technologically essential devices for photonic computation and efficient speckle-free illumination.

Jie Qian, Qi Hong, Zi-Yuan Wang, Wen-Xin Wu, Yihao Yang, C. -M. Hu, J. Q. You, Yi-Pu Wang
Chiral coupling opens new avenues for controlling and exploiting light-matter interactions. We demonstrate that chiral coupling can be utilized to achieve unidirectional perfect absorption. In our experiments, chiral magnon-photon coupling is realized by coupling the magnon modes in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres with spin-momentum-locked waveguide modes supported by spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs). These photon modes exhibit transverse spin, with the spin direction determined by the propagation direction. Due to the intrinsic spin properties of the magnon mode, it exclusively couples with microwaves traveling in one direction, effectively suppressing the reflection channel. Under the critical coupling condition, transmission is also eliminated, resulting in unidirectional perfect absorption. By incorporating additional YIG spheres, bidirectional and multi-frequency perfect absorption can be achieved. Our work introduces a novel platform for exploring and harnessing chiral light-matter interactions within spin-momentum locked devices, offering a paradigm for unidirectional signal processing and energy harvesting technologies.

[84]. [*Abelian-Higgs vortices in the oscillating axion background*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16720 "Abelian-Higgs vortices in the oscillating axion background")
Naoya Kitajima, Shota Nakagawa
We study the dynamics of Abelian-Higgs vortices in the background of a coherently oscillating axion field. We show that the electric field is induced in the magnetic core of the vortex due to the axion-photon conversion. Moreover, because the electromagnetic field is confined in the vortex and excluded from the superconducting bulk regions due to the Meissner effect, the vortex tube can be regarded as a cylindrical cavity, and our numerical analysis shows that the resonant cavity mode (TM010 mode) can be efficiently enhanced in this tube. We also focus on the interaction of two vortices in the oscillating axion background, resulting in attractive or repulsive forces, even in the case with the BPS limit. These new features open up a new possibility for the axion dark matter search using superconducting devices.

[85]. [*Notes from the bulk*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16744 "Notes from the bulk")
Erica Bertolini
The scope of this Ph.D thesis is to study the effects of the presence of a boundary from a Quantum Field Theoretical perspective, searching for new physics and explanations of observed phenomena. In particular, thanks to the formal QFT setting, the issue of the existence of local, accelerated, edge modes in Hall systems is analyzed and understood in terms of the bulk-to-boundary approach as related to a curved background in topological QFTs with boundary. Within this formalism the induced metric on the boundary can be associated to the ad hoc potential introduced in the phenomenological models in order to obtain such non-constant edge velocities. This also leads to the prediction of local modes for Topological Insulators, and Quantum Spin Hall systems in general. The paradigm for which only topological QFTs have a physical content on the boundary is broken, and also non-Topological Quantum Field Theories such as fracton models and Linearized Gravity are shown to have non-trivial boundary dynamics. Indeed due to the breaking of their defining symmetry both models have a current algebra of the Kac-Moody type on the boundary. In the case of fractons this algebra is in a generalized form, which also appears in some kinds of higher order Topological Insulators, a sign of a possible relation between these materials and edge states of fracton quasiparticles. Concerning the theory of Linearized Gravity, instead, the algebra is a standard Kac-Moody one, whose presence was suspected, but never proved before. Physical results on the boundary range between condensed matter, elasticity and (massive) gravity models. A collateral result, which enrich this Thesis, is the building of a new covariant QFT for fractons with a peculiar gauge structure. This new model better highlight the properties of these quasiparticles.

Piyush Garg, Marco Edoardo Rosti
Gaining a fundamental understanding of turbulent flows of dilute polymer solutions has been a challenging and outstanding problem for a long time. In this letter, we examine homogeneous, isotropic polymeric turbulence at large Reynolds and Deborah numbers through direct numerical simulations. While at the largest scales of the flow inertial turbulence exists, we find that the flow is fundamentally altered from Newtonian turbulence below the Kolmogorov scale. We demonstrate that `Elastic Turbulence' exists at the smallest scales of polymeric turbulence by quantifying multiple statistical properties of the flow - energy spectrum and flux in Fourier space as well as the spatial statistics of the velocity field - the structure functions and kurtosis, and energy dissipation. Our results show the coexistence of two fundamentally distinct types of turbulence in polymeric fluids and point to the ubiquity of elastic turbulence, which was hitherto only known to exist for negligible inertia.

Junjun Xu
The Haldane phase with local SU(3) adjoint representation constitutes the simplest non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phases in the SU($N>2$) Heisenberg spin chains. In this paper, we propose a quantum simulation of this phase using a two-species spinor Bose gas. The system consists of two interlaced, species-dependent zigzag optical lattices, where the two species label the quark and antiquark states of SU(3) symmetry. In the strong-coupling limit, we determine the ground-state phase diagram, and identify a quantum phase transition from the Haldane phase to a dimer phase. We characterize the Haldane phase through its experimental signatures, including edge modes, nonlocal string order, and entanglement spectra. To further understand these observations at the dimer phase, we construct an explicit ground-state ansatz at the dimer point.

Daifeng Tu, Can Wang, Jianhui Zhou
Fourfold anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) have been widely observed in quantum materials, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we find, in a variety of three-dimensional Dirac materials that can be unifiedly described by the massive Dirac equation, the intrinsic orbital magnetic moment of electrons vary synchronously with the magnetic field and give rise to a {\pi} periodic correction to its velocity, further leading to unusual fourfold AMR, dubbed orbital fourfold AMR. Our theory not only explains the observation of fourfold AMR in bismuth but also uncovers the nature of the dominant fourfold AMR in thin films of antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4, which arises from the near cancellation of the twofold AMR from the surface states and bulk states due to distinct spin-momentum lockings. Our work provides a new mechanism for creation and manipulation of orbital fourfold AMR in both conventional conductors and various topological insulators.

Electronic liquid crystal (ELC) phases are spontaneous symmetry breaking states believed to arise from strong electron correlation in quantum materials such as cuprates and iron pnictides. Here, we report a direct observation of a smectic phase in a weakly correlated nonsymmorphic square-net semimetal GdSbxTe2-x. Incommensurate smectic charge modulation and intense local unidirectional nanostructure, which coexist with Dirac fermions across Fermi level, are visualized by using spectroscopic imaging - scanning tunneling microscopy. As materials with highly mobile carriers are mostly weakly correlated, the discovery of such an ELC phase are anomalous and raise questions on the origin of their emergence. Specifically, we demonstrate how chemical substitution generates these symmetry breaking phases before the system undergoes a charge density wave (CDW) - orthorhombic structural transition. Our results highlight the importance of impurities in realizing ELC phases and present a new material platform for exploring the interplay among quenched disorder, Dirac fermions and electron correlation.

Jiming Zheng, Zhiyue Lu
Fluctuation-dissipation relations elucidate the response of near-equilibrium systems to environmental changes, with recent advances extending response theory to non-equilibrium steady states. However, a general response theory for systems evolving far from steady states has remained elusive. This letter presents a complete trajectory information geometric framework that generalizes response theory for non-stationary Markov processes. By constructing the full trajectory probability manifold and identifying a globally orthogonal coordinate system defined by transition rates, we derive a diagonal Fisher information metric that enables explicit calculations in this high-dimensional space. From the local metric structure, we obtain a Cramer-Rao-type inequality that bounds the linear response of arbitrary non-stationary observables. Furthermore, by analyzing the global geometry of this manifold, we derive a universal non-perturbative (nonlinear) response inequality in terms of geodesic length. This geometric framework reveals deep connections between dynamical activity, observable variance, and system sensitivity, and it encompasses or anticipates several recent results as special cases. Our approach offers new design principles for responsive behaviors in far-from-equilibrium systems.

L. Dal Fabbro, H. Holuigue, M. Chighizola, A. Podest\`a
In this work, we have validated the application of Hertzian contact mechanics models and corrections for the analysis of force vs indentation curves, acquired using spherical indenters on linearly elastic samples, by means of finite elements simulations and AFM nanomechanical measurements of polyacrylamide gels possessing a thickness gradient. We have systematically investigated the impact of both large indentations and vertical spatial confinement (bottom effect) on the accuracy of the nanomechanical analysis performed with the Hertz model for the parabolic indenter compared to the Sneddon model for the spherical indenter. We demonstrated the accuracy of the combined correction of large indentation and bottom effects for the Hertz model proposed in the literature in the framework of linearized force vs indentation curves acquired using spherical indenters, as well as a validation of a new linearized form of the Sneddon model. Our results show that the corrected Hertz model allows to accurately quantify the Young's modulus of elasticity of linearly elastic samples with variable thickness at arbitrarily large indentations.

Xiaoyang Shen, Zhengzhi Wu, Shao-Kai Jian
We study the boundary criticality enriched by boundary fermions, which ubiquitously emerge in topological phases of matter, with a focus on topological insulators and topological superconductors. By employing dimensional regularization and bosonization techniques, we uncover several unprecedented boundary universality classes. These include the boundary Gross-Neveu-Yukawa critical point and the special Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, both resulting from the interplay between edge modes and bulk bosons. We present a comprehensive sketch of the phase diagram that accommodates these boundary criticalities and delineate their critical exponents. Additionally, we explore a 1+1D conformal defect decorated with fermions, where a defect BKT transition is highlighted. We conclude with a discussion on potential experimental realizations of these phenomena.

G. Marchegiani, G. Catelani
Superconducting qubits hold promise for quantum computing, but their operation is challenged by various sources of noise, including excitations known as quasiparticles. Qubits with gap asymmetry larger than their transition energy are less susceptible to quasiparticle decoherence as the quasiparticles are mostly trapped in the low-gap side of the junction. Because of this trapping, the gap asymmetry can contribute to maintaining the quasiparticles out of equilibrium. Here we address the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle densities in the two sides of the junction. We show that four qualitatively different regimes are possible with increasing temperature: i) nonequilibrium, ii) local quasiequilibrium, iii) global quasiequilibrium, and iv) full equilibrium. We identify shortcomings in assuming global quasiequilibrium when interpreting experimental data, highlighting how measurements in the presence of magnetic field can aid the accurate determination of the junction parameters, and hence the identification of the nonequilibrium regimes.

Yuanning Chen, Zijie Zhu, Konrad Viebahn
Multi-photon resonances to high-lying energy levels represent an unavoidable source of Floquet heating in strongly driven quantum systems. In this work, we extend the recently developed two-tone approach of 'cancelling' multi-photon resonances to shaken lattices in the Hubbard regime. Our experiments show that even for strong lattice shaking the inclusion of a weak second drive leads to cancellation of multi-photon heating resonances. Surprisingly, the optimal cancelling amplitude depends on the Hubbard interaction strength $U$, in qualitative agreement with exact diagonalisation calculations. Our results call for novel analytical approaches to capture the physics of strongly-driven-strongly-interacting many-body systems.

Junyu Tang, Hantao Zhang, Ran Cheng
Interplay between magnetic ordering and topological electrons not only enables new topological phases but also underpins electrical control of magnetism. Here we extend the Kane-Mele model to include the exchange coupling to a collinear background antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, which can describe transition metal trichalcogenides. Owing to the spin-orbit coupling and staggered on-site potential, the system could exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall effects in the absence of a net magnetization. Besides the chiral edge states, these topological phases support a staggered Edelstein effect through which an applied electric field can generate opposite non-equilibrium spins on the two AFM sublattices, realizing the N\'eel-type spin-orbit torque (NSOT). Contrary to known NSOTs in AFM metals driven by conduction currents, our NSOT arises from pure adiabatic currents devoid of Joule heating, while being a bulk effect not carried by the edge currents. By virtue of the NSOT, the electric field of a microwave can drive the AFM dynamics with a remarkably high efficiency. Compared to the ordinary AFM resonance driven by the magnetic field, the new mechanism can enhance the resonance amplitude by more than one order of magnitude and the absorption rate of the microwave power by over two orders of magnitude. Our findings unravel an incredible way to exploit AFM topological phases to achieve ultrafast magnetic dynamics.

[96]. [*Towards a Topological Proof of the Strong Subadditivity*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05077 "Towards a Topological Proof of the Strong Subadditivity")
Chih-Yu Lo, Po-Yao Chang
Topological entanglement entropy (TEE) represents an intrinsic contribution to the entanglement entropy (EE) in topologically ordered systems. In quantum information theory, strong subadditivity (SSA) is a fundamental property of EE, reflecting the non-negativity of conditional mutual information. TEE was originally believed to be a universal correction to the area law of EE, suggesting that its SSA would directly follow from the SSA of EE. However, due to spurious contributions, the correction term is not universal; consequently, the value predicted by topological quantum field theory (TQFT) provides only a lower bound. In this work, we present a topological analysis showing that the SSA for TEE is equivalent to a specific inequality within the TQFT framework. We further verify that this inequality holds for all known unitary modular tensor categories (UMTCs) up to rank 11, supporting the conjecture that SSA holds universally in the TQFT framework. Conversely, assuming the validity of the SSA condition, the inequality can be interpreted as a consistency criterion for candidate UMTCs.

Ji Woong Yu, Daeseong Yong, Bae-Yeun Ha, Changbong Hyeon
Inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent (depletion) attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the volume of depletion zones around the inclusions, thereby to maximize the entropy of the surrounding polymers. Here, we study the brush-induced depletion attraction between cylindrical inclusions using molecular dynamics simulations and the Asakura-Oosawa theory. Our considerations find that the correlation blobs defined in the brush environment serve as the fundamental units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the entropy of the overgrown polymer competes with the depletion attraction between the inclusions. As a result, the brush-induced depletion interaction displays non-monotonic variations with the brush height. Our study not only expands the repertoire of colloid-polymer mixtures to depletion interactions in brushes, but also suggests the brush-induced depletion interaction as a previously unappreciated mechanism for glycocalyx-induced protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.

Interatomic potentials are key to uncovering microscopic structure-property relationships, essential for multiscale simulations and high-throughput experiments. For metallic glasses, their disordered atomic structure makes the development of potentials particularly challenging, resulting in the scarcity of chemistry-specific parametrizations for this important class of materials. We address this gap by introducing an efficient methodology to design machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), benchmarked on the CuZrAl system. Using a Lennard-Jones surrogate model, swap-Monte Carlo sampling, and single-point Density Functional Theory (DFT) corrections, we capture amorphous structures spanning 14 decades of supercooling. These representative configurations, competing with the experimental time scale, enable robust model training across diverse states, while minimizing the need for extensive DFT datasets. The resulting MLIP matches the experimental data and predictions of the classical embedded atom method (EAM) for structural, dynamical, energetic, and mechanical properties. This approach offers a scalable path to develop accurate MLIPs for complex metallic glasses, including emerging multi-component and high-entropy systems.

[99]. [*Unified Linear Fluctuation-Response Theory Arbitrarily Far from Equilibrium*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01050 "Unified Linear Fluctuation-Response Theory Arbitrarily Far from Equilibrium")
Jiming Zheng, Zhiyue Lu
Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is a fundamental challenge in physics, particularly for non-equilibrium and non-stationary processes. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a complete framework for near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds have recently been reported for specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we present an exact response equality for arbitrary Markov processes that decompose system response into spatial correlations of local dynamical events. This decomposition reveals that response properties are encoded in correlations between transitions and dwelling times across the network, providing a natural generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and recently developed non-equilibrium linear response relations. Our theory unifies existing response bounds, extends them to time-dependent processes, and reveals fundamental monotonicity properties of the tightness of multi-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoretical significance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation of response properties from sampling unperturbed trajectories, offering significant advantages over traditional finite-difference approaches for estimating response properties of complex networks and biological systems far from equilibrium.

Jack A. Logan, Jacob Sumner, Alex T. Grigas, Mark D. Shattuck, Corey S. OHern
Proteins are composed of chains of amino acids that fold into complex three-dimensional structures. Several key features, such as the radius of gyration, fraction of core amino acids $f_{\rm core}$, packing fraction $\langle \phi\rangle$ of core amino acids, and structure factor $S(q)$ define the structure of folded proteins. It is well-known that folded proteins are compact with a radius of gyration $R_g(N) \sim N^{\nu}$ that obeys power-law scaling with the number of amino acids $N$ and $\nu \sim 1/3$, $f_{\rm core} \approx 0.09$, and $\langle \phi \rangle \approx 0.55$. We also investigate the {\it internal} scaling of the radius of gyration $R_g(n)$ versus the chemical separation $n$ between amino acids for subchains of length $n$ and show that it does not obey simple power-law scaling with $\nu \sim 1/3$. Instead, $R_g(n) \sim n^{\nu_{1,2}}$ with a larger exponent $\nu_1 > 1/3$ for small $n$ and smaller exponent $\nu_{2} < 1/3$ for large $n$. To develop a minimal model for proteins that recapitulates these defining structural features, we carry out collapse simulations for a series of coarse-grained models with increasing complexity. We show that a model, which coarse-grains amino acids into a single spherical backbone bead and several variable-sized side-chain beads and enforces bend- and dihedral-angle constraints for the backbone, recapitulates $R_g(n)$, $f_{\rm core}$, $\langle \phi \rangle$, and $S(q)$ for more than $2500$ x-ray crystal structures of proteins.

Composites of ferroelectric and paraelectric perovskites have attracted a lot of attention due to their application potential in energy storage as well as novel computing and memory devices. So far the main focus of research has been on superlattices and ferroelectric particles in a paraelectric matrix, while the impact of paraelectric inclusions on the ferroelectric matrix is surprisingly underrepresented. To close this gap in knowledge we perform molecular dynamics simulations using an $ab\ initio$ derived effective Hamiltonian for BaTiO$_3$--SrTiO$_3$ and reveal the dependency of phase stability and phase transitions on the size and distances of paraelectric inclusions. We discuss how the combination of compressive strain and depolarization fields at the SrTiO$_3$ interfaces induces large local polarization, complex domain structures and coexisting phases as well as diffuse phase transitions and reduced coercive fields.

Nano-patterning has been shown to be a powerful tool for manipulating the vibrational modes of elastic structures, with applications such as optical-mechanical mode coupling. Inspired by these recent developments in phononic band engineering, we propose a nano-patterning scheme to enhance the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in phonon-mediated nano-film superconductors, such as aluminum. Using the finite element method, we simulate the lattice vibrational modes of nano-patterned films within the Debye model. Our results show that periodic nano-patterning softens the lattice vibrational modes compared to bulk films. It also increases the density of states at high energies, resulting in a couple of percent enhancement in $T_c$. Moreover, we investigate connections to Weyl's law and provide an experimental design prescription to optimize nano-patterning for further enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature.

Glasses are traditionally characterized by their rugged landscape of disordered low-energy states and their slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Far from equilibrium, dynamical forms of glassy behavior with anomalous algebraic relaxation have also been noted, for example, in networks of coupled oscillators. Due to their disordered and high-dimensional nature, such systems have been difficult to study theoretically, but data-driven methods are emerging as a promising alternative that may aid in their analysis. Here, we characterize glassy dynamics using the dynamic mode decomposition, a data-driven spectral computation that approximates the Koopman spectrum. We show that the gap between oscillatory and decaying modes in the Koopman spectrum vanishes in systems exhibiting algebraic relaxation, and thus, we propose a model-agnostic signature for robustly detecting and analyzing glassy dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through both a minimal example of a one-dimensional ODE and a high-dimensional example of coupled oscillators.

Following the successful prediction of the superconducting phase diagram for infinite-layer nickelates, here we calculate the superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ vs. the number of layers $n$ for finite-layer nickelates using the dynamical vertex approximation. To this end, we start with density functional theory, and include local correlations non-perturbatively by dynamical mean-field theory for $n=2$ to 7. For all $n$, the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital crosses the Fermi level, but for $n>4$ there are additional $(\pi, \pi)$ pockets or tubes that slightly enhance the layer-averaged hole doping of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals beyond the leading $1/n$ contribution stemming from the valence electron count. We finally calculate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the single-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Hubbard model by dynamical vertex approximation.

Pulsed laser-deposited amorphous carbon nanofoams are potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage applications due to ultra-light weight, large volumetric void fractions, and co-existence of sp, sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridization. It is known that charge storage in carbon nanostructures containing disordered sp2-domains is determined by their wettability, surface area, and porosity. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the areal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its wettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance was enhanced by about fifty times and the device voltage increased from 0.8 to 1.1 V compared to as-grown carbon nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the first time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ measurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute this effect, observed but generally not explained in previous works in the literature, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes during the charge storage performance. This optimization of pulsed laser deposited carbon nanofoam may open an avenue for fabricating lightweight and porous nanostructures for advanced macro-to-micro-supercapacitor devices.

Mirko Daumann, Thomas Dahm
The imbalanced Hubbard model features a transition between dynamic regimes depending on the mass ratio and coupling strength between two different particle species. A slowdown of the lighter particle transport can be attributed to an emergent effective disorder induced by the heavy particles for high mass ratio and strong coupling. This subdiffusive regime has been interpreted as a Griffiths phase, linking the effect to the coexistence of metallic and insulating regions. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the heavy particles, which also reveals subdiffusive behavior, yet cannot be explained within the Griffiths picture. We demonstrate that heavy particles predominantly form small clusters, mainly pairs, during the dynamical process, which reduces their propagation speed and transiently shifts the time-dependent diffusion constant into the subdiffusive regime at late times. The necessary attraction between particles driving this process can be understood within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We introduce a classical one-dimensional random walk model that can quantitatively reproduce the subdiffusion dynamics in the strong coupling regime.

Stefan Liscak, Andreas Haller, Andreas Michels, Thomas L. Schmidt, Vladyslav M. Kuchkin
We study the low-energy excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg model with a monoaxial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, our analysis reveals a degeneracy between skyrmion and antiskyrmion states, enabling the formation of a mesoscopic Schr\"odinger cat state - a quantum superposition of these topologically distinct textures. To characterize this nontrivial state, we compute two-point spin correlation functions, highlighting signatures accessible via neutron scattering experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applying a magnetic field gradient induces a coherent time evolution of the cat state, offering a controllable mechanism for its manipulation. These findings provide a framework for the detection of skyrmionic Schr\"odinger cat states in quantum magnets.

We consider the valence bond solid (VBS) state built of singlet pairs of fundamental representations and projected onto adjoint representations of the exceptional Lie group G$_2$. The two-point correlation function in the VBS state is non-vanishing only for nearest neighbours, but possesses finite string order. We construct a parent Hamiltonian for the VBS state, which constitutes the G$_2$ analog of the famous AKLT chain.

B Sriram Shastry
We present a new method for calculating the Yang-Lee partition function zeros of a translationally invariant model of lattice fermions, exemplified by the Hubbard model. The method rests on a theorem involving the single electron self-energy $\Sigma_\sigma(k, i \omega_n)$ in the imaginary time Matsubara formulation. The theorem maps the Yang-Lee zeros to a set of wavevector and spin labeled virtual energies $\xi_{k \sigma}$. These, thermodynamically derived virtual energies, are solutions of equations involving the self-energy at corresponding $k\sigma$'s. Examples of the method in simplified situations are provided.

Salvatore Torquato, Jaeuk Kim
Stealthy interactions are an emerging class of nontrivial, bounded long-ranged oscillatory pair potentials with classical ground states that can be disordered, hyperuniform, and infinitely degenerate. Their hybrid crystal-liquid nature endows them with novel physical properties with advantages over their crystalline counterparts. Here, we show the existence of nonequilibrium hard-sphere glasses within this unusual ground-state manifold as the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ tends to zero that are remarkably configurationally extremely close to hyperuniform 3D maximally random jammed (MRJ) sphere packings. The latter are prototypical glasses since they are maximally disordered, perfectly rigid, and perfectly nonergodic. Our optimization procedure, which leverages the maximum cardinality of the infinite ground-state set, not only guarantees that our packings are hyperuniform with the same structure-factor scaling exponent as the MRJ state, but they share other salient structural attributes, including a packing fraction of $0.638$, a mean contact number per particle of 6, gap exponent of $0.44(1)$, and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ and structures factors $S(k)$ that are virtually identical to one another for all $r$ and $k$, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that stealthy hyperuniform packings can be created within the disordered regime ($0 < \chi <1/2$) with heretofore unattained maximal packing fractions. As $\chi$ increases from zero, they always form interparticle contacts, albeit with sparser contact networks as $\chi$ increases from zero, resulting in linear polymer-like chains of contacting particles with increasingly shorter chain lengths. The capacity to generate ultradense stealthy hyperuniform packings for all $\chi$ opens up new materials applications in optics and acoustics.

Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White
We present a method to numerically obtain low-energy effective models based on a unitary transformation of the ground state. The algorithm finds a unitary circuit that transforms the ground state of the original model to a projected wavefunction with only the low-energy degrees of freedom. The effective model can then be derived using the unitary transformation encoded in the circuit. We test our method on the one-dimensional and two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model at half-filling, and obtain more accurate effective spin models than the standard perturbative approach.

Naoto Shiraishi, Mizuki Yamaguchi
We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.grability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.

Paolo Emilio Di Nunzio
This work presents a fully physical model of the hydrogen diffusion and trapping kinetics in metals, integrating permeation and thermal desorption within a unified framework. Based on the McNabb and Foster approach, it requires only binding energy and number density of trap sites. It correctly reproduces the physics of the system and the results of the analytical solutions of the permeation kinetics. It is also capable of reproducing thermal desorption spectra with considerable accuracy. The sensitivity analysis has elucidated the relationships among the processing conditions and the parameters commonly used to characterize permeation and thermal desorption experiments. An equation empirically derived from the simulation results, expressing the dependence of time lag in desorption on specimen thickness, number density of occupied trap sites, and cathodic concentration, is proposed. In summary, the model represents a valuable tool in supporting the interpretation and rationalization of experiments also from a quantitative viewpoint.

J. Eckseler (Bielefeld University), M. Pieper (Bielefeld University), J. Schnack (Bielefeld University)
The Lanczos algorithm, introduced by Cornelius Lanczos, has been known for a long time and is widely used in computational physics. While often employed to approximate extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectores of an operator, recently interest in the sequence of basis vectors produced by the algorithm rose in the context of Krylov complexity. Although it is generally accepted and partially proven that the procedure is numerically stable for approximating the eigenvalues, there are numerical problems when investigating the Krylov basis constructed via the Lanczos procedure. In this paper, we show that loss of orthogonality and the attempt of reorthoganalization fall short of understanding and addressing the problem. Instead, the numerical sequence of eigenvectors in finite precision arithmetic escapes the true vector space spanned by the exact Lanczos vectors. This poses the real threat to an interpretation in view of the operator growth hypothesis.

Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.

Chen-Huan Wu
We investigate the Holstein mechanism in a single-electron (one-site) system, where unitary evolution intrinsically involves both fermion and boson operators under nonadiabatic conditions. The resulting unitary dynamics and boson-frequency dependence reveal a quantum phase transition, evidenced by distinct short-time (power-law decay) and long-time (exponential decay) behaviors, which are manifested in the polaronic shift, bosonic energy, and dynamics of reduced density matrix. This observation is consistent with a non-Markovian to Markovian transition.

Andrew Urilyon, Leonardo Biagetti, Jitendra Kethepalli, Jacopo De Nardis
One-dimensional integrable and quasi-integrable systems display, on macroscopic scales, a universal form of transport known as Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD). In its standard Euler-scale formulation, GHD mirrors the equations of a two-dimensional compressible fluid but ignores fluctuations and becomes numerically unwieldy as soon as integrability-breaking perturbations are introduced. We show that GHD can be efficiently simulated as a gas of semiclassical wave packets - a natural generalisation of hard-rod particles - whose trajectories are efficiently mapped onto those of point particles. This representation (i) provides a transparent route to incorporate integrability-breaking terms, and (ii) automatically embeds the exact fluctuating-hydrodynamics extension of GHD. The resulting framework enables fast, large-scale simulations of quasi-integrable systems even in the presence of complicated integrability-breaking perturbations. It also manifest the pivotal role of two-point correlations in systems confined by external potentials: we demonstrate that situations where local one-point observables appear thermalised can nevertheless sustain long-lived, far-from-equilibrium long-range correlations for arbitrarily long times, signaling that, differently from what previously stated, true thermalisation is not reached at diffusive time-scales.

Saikat Banerjee, Stephan Humeniuk
We study the effects of magnon-magnon interactions in the two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr$_3$ focusing on its honeycomb lattice structure. Motivated by earlier theoretical predictions of temperature-induced spectral shifts and van Hove singularities in the magnon dispersion~\cite{PhysRevX.8.011010}, we go beyond the commonly used thermal magnon approximation by applying second-order perturbation theory in a fully numerical framework. Our analysis uncovers significant deviations from previous analysis: in particular, the predicted singularities are absent, consistent with recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements~\cite{PhysRevLett.129.127201}. Moreover, we find that the temperature dependence of the renormalized magnon spectrum exhibits a distinct $T^3$ behavior for the optical magnon branch, while retaining $T^2$ behavior for the acoustic or down magnon band. This feature sheds new light on the collective dynamics of Dirac magnons and their interactions. We further compare the honeycomb case with a triangular Bravais lattice, relevant for ferromagnetic monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, and show that both systems lack singular features while displaying quite distinct thermal trends.

The absence of inversion symmetry in chiral tellurium (Te) creates exotic spin textures within its electron waves. However, understanding textured optical waves within Te remains a challenge due to the semi-classical limitations of long-wavelength approximation. To unveil these textured optical waves, we develop a spin-resolved deep-microscopic optical bandstructure for Te analogous to its electronic counterpart. We demonstrate that the degeneracies in this optical bandstructure is lifted by the twisted lattice of Te, which induces optical gyrotropy. Our theory shows excellent agreement with experimental optical gyrotropy measurements. At the lattice level, we reveal that the chirality of Te manifests as deep-microscopic optical spin texture within the optical wave. Our framework uncovers the finite-momentum origin of optical activity and provides a microscopic basis for light-matter interactions in chiral crystalline materials.

Lucas D\'esoppi, Bertrand Reulet
We consider the modeling of noise in a nonlinear, classical, resistive electrical component using two models: i) a continuous description based on a stochastic differential equation with a white thermal Gaussian noise; ii) a discrete, shot noise model based on a Markovian master equation. We show that thermodynamics imposes in i) the use of the H\"anggi-Klimontovich (H-K) prescription when the noise depends on bias voltage, and implies a generalized Johnson-Nyquist relation for the noise where the conductance is replaced by the ratio mean current over voltage. In ii) we show that the discrete description compatible with thermodynamics leads to the continuous one of i) with again the H-K prescription. Here the generalized Johnson-Nyquist relation for noise is recovered only at low voltage, when the continuous description is valid.

Liang Sun, Mohan Chen
The Wang-Teter-like nonlocal kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) in the framework of orbital-free density functional theory, while successful in some bulk systems, exhibits a critical Blanc-Cances instability [J. Chem. Phys. 122, 214106 (2005)] when applied to isolated systems, where the total energy becomes unbounded from below. We trace this instability to the use of an ill-defined average charge density, which causes the functional to simultaneously violate the scaling law and the positivity of the Pauli energy. By rigorously constructing a density-functional-dependent kernel, we resolve these pathologies while preserving the formal exactness of the original framework. By systematically benchmarking single-atom systems of 56 elements, we find the resulting KEDF retains computational efficiency while achieving an order-of-magnitude accuracy enhancement over the WT KEDF. In addition, the new KEDF preserves WT's superior accuracy in bulk metals, outperforming the semilocal functionals in both regimes.

Due to the deterministic nature of chaotic systems, fluctuations in their trajectories arise solely from the choice of initial conditions. Some of these dynamical fluctuations may lead to extremely unlikely scenarios. Understanding the impact of such rare events and the trajectories that give rise to them is of significant interest across disciplines. Yet, identifying the initial conditions responsible for those events is a challenging task due to the inherent sensitivity to small perturbations of chaotic dynamics. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 227201 (2023)], this challenge was addressed by finding the effective dynamics that make rare events typical for one-dimensional chaotic maps. Here we extend such large-deviation framework to $d$-dimensional chaotic maps. Specifically, for any such map, we propose a method to find an effective topologically-conjugate map which reproduces the rare-event statistics in the long-time limit. We demonstrate the applicability of this result using several observables of paradigmatic examples of two-dimensional chaos, namely the two-dimensional tent map and Arnold's cat map.

We report a significant reduction of low-temperature damping losses in tensile-strained, ultrathin Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) films grown by pulsed laser deposition, exhibiting ultralow damping constants and tunable magnetic anisotropy. Comparative broadband FMR measurements show that tensile-strained YIG films on Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 (GSGG) retain low damping even at nanometer thicknesses and cryogenic temperatures, outperforming relaxed films on Gd3Ga5O12. Based on static magnetometry measurements and microstructural characterization, we attribute these enhanced dynamic properties to the suppression of interdiffusion across the YIG/GSGG interface, resulting from enhanced chemical stability and favorable growth kinetics by the presence of Sc. Our findings highlight the importance of chemical and kinetic factors in achieving few-nanometer-thick YIG film with negligible low-temperature damping dissipation and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for cryogenic spintronic applications.

David W. Kanaar, Yasuo Oda, Mark F. Gyure, J. P. Kestner
Semiconductor spin qubits are a promising platform for quantum computing but remain vulnerable to charge noise. Accurate, in situ measurement of charge noise could enable closed-loop control and improve qubit performance. Here, we propose a method for real-time detection of charge noise using a silicon singlet-triplet qubit with one electron initialized in an excited valley state. This valley excitation acts as a spectator degree of freedom, coupled to a high-quality resonator via the exchange interaction, which is sensitive to charge-noise-induced voltage fluctuations. Dispersive readout of the resonator enables a continuous, classical measurement of exchange fluctuations during qubit operation. Signal-to-noise analysis shows that, under realistic device parameters, sub-millisecond measurement times are possible using a quantum-limited amplifier. Even without such an amplifier, similar performance is achievable with appropriately engineered resonator parameters. This approach allows the probe to monitor slow drift in exchange in real time, opening the door to feedback and feedforward strategies for maintaining high-fidelity quantum operations. Importantly, the protocol preserves spin coherence and can be run concurrently with qubit logic gates.

We introduce a minimal model consisting of a two-body system with stochastically broken reciprocity (i.e., random violation of Newton's third law) and then investigate its statistical behaviors, including fluctuations of velocity and position, time evolution of probability distribution functions, energy gain, and entropy production. The effective temperature of this two-body system immersed in a thermal bath is also derived. Furthermore, we heuristically present an extremely minimal model where the relative motion adheres to the same rules as in classical mechanics, while the effect of stochastically broken reciprocity only manifests in the fluctuating motion of the center of mass.

Mathias S. Scheurer, Harley D. Scammell
Recent experiments on the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ reveal a curious phase transition-like feature: a nematic magnetic torque response that abruptly sets in at $T_\tau \approx 130$K, above the known charge density wave transition at $T_\text{CDW} \approx 100$K. Counterintuitively, elastoresistance measurements--a standard probe of nematicity--show no corresponding signal, ruling out a nematic phase transition and placing strong constraints on possible explanations. Beyond nematicity, the torque is paramagnetic for in-plane magnetic field, while above a critical out-of-plane field, an in-plane magnetisation appears, accompanied by hysteresis. We show that this combination of features cannot be accounted for by charge density waves or intraband magnetic order. Instead, we propose that interband ordering--via a symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling and a time-reversal and spatial symmetry-breaking interband order parameter--together with a background strain field, consistent with typical experimental conditions, provides a natural explanation; in our picture, the behaviour at $T_\tau$ is understood as a crossover in the symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling strength. Our theory accounts for the nematic magnetic torque, hysteresis, and the transition-like onset at $T_\tau$, while also making testable predictions, including strain-induced magnetisation. In doing so, it challenges the prevailing view of the normal state.

Alexander Atanasov, Jacob A. Zavatone-Veth, Cengiz Pehlevan
Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.

Andrea Pizzi, Long-Hei Kwan, Bertrand Evrard, Ceren B. Dag, Johannes Knolle
Chaos makes isolated systems of many interacting particles quickly thermalize and forget about their past. Here, we show that quantum mechanics hinders chaos in many-body systems: although the quantum eigenstates are thermal and strongly entangled, exponentially many of them are scarred, that is, have an enlarged weight along underlying classical unstable periodic orbits. Scarring makes the system more likely to be found on an orbit it was initialized on, retaining a memory of its past and thus weakly breaking ergodicity, even at long times and despite the system being fully thermal and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis fulfilled. We demonstrate the ubiquity of quantum scarring in many-body systems by considering a large family of spin models, including some of the most popular ones from condensed matter physics. Our findings, at hand for modern quantum simulators, prove structure in spite of chaos in many-body quantum systems.

The benefit of exchange-only qubits compared to other spin qubit types is the universal control using only voltage controlled exchange interactions between neighboring spins. As a compromise, qubit operations have to be constructed from non-orthogonal rotation axes of the Bloch sphere and result in rather long pulsing sequences. This paper aims to develop a faster implementation of single-qubit gates using simultaneous exchange pulses and manifests their potential for the construction of two-qubit gates. We introduce pulse sequences in which single-qubit gates could be executed faster and show that subsequences on three spins in two-qubit gates could be implemented in fewer steps. Our findings can particularly speed up gate sequences for realistic idle times between sequential pulses and we show that this advantage increases with more interconnectivity of the quantum dots. We further demonstrate how a phase operation can introduce a relative phase between the computational and some of the leakage states, which can be advantageous for the construction of two-qubit gates. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize a simultaneous exchange implementation of $X$ rotations in a SiGe quantum dot device and compare to the state of the art with sequential exchange pulses.

Harry Hanlim Kang, Ilan T. Rosen, Max Hays, Jeffrey A. Grover, William D. Oliver
We propose a method to realize microwave-activated CZ gates between two remote spin qubits in quantum dots using a charge-sensitive superconducting coupler. The qubits are longitudinally coupled to the coupler, so that the transition frequency of the coupler depends on the logical qubit states; a capacitive network model using first-quantized charge operators is developed to illustrate this. Driving the coupler transition then implements a conditional phase shift on the qubits. Two pulsing schemes are investigated: a rapid, off-resonant pulse with constant amplitude, and a pulse with envelope engineering that incorporates dynamical decoupling to mitigate charge noise. We develop non-Markovian time-domain simulations to accurately model gate performance in the presence of $1/f^\beta$ charge noise. Simulation results indicate that a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 90% is possible with realistic parameters and noise models.

Xin-Yue Liu, Chun-Jie Yang, Jun-Hong An
As an ideal platform for exploring strong quantized light-matter interactions, surface plasmon polariton (SPP) has inspired many applications in quantum technologies. Recent experiments discovered that quantum surface effects (QSEs) of the metal, including nonlocal optical response, electron spill-out, and Landau damping, invalidate the classical electromagnetic theory and contribute additional loss sources to the SPP in the nanoscale. This hinders its applications. Going beyond the widely used classical local response approximation, we use the Feibelman $d$-parameter method to investigate the QSE-modified non-Markovian dynamics of quantum emitters (QEs) coupled to a SPP in a planar metal-dielectric nanostructure. A mechanism to overcome the dissipation of the QEs caused by the lossy SPP with the QSEs is discovered. We find that, as long as the QE-SPP bound states are formed, a dissipationless entanglement among the far-separated QEs is created. Compared with the local-response approximate results, the QSEs play a constructive role in establishing such a coherent correlation. The result lays a foundation for understanding the light-matter interactions in absorptive media and paves the way for the application of SPP in quantum network.

We consider the estimation of an unknown parameter $\theta$ via a many-body probe. The probe is initially prepared in a product state and many-body time-independent interactions enhance its $\theta$-sensitivity during the dynamics and/or in the steady state. We present bounds on the Quantum Fisher Information, and corresponding optimal interacting Hamiltonians, for two paradigmatic scenarios for encoding~$\theta$: (i)~via unitary Hamiltonian dynamics (dynamical metrology), and (ii)~in the Gibbs and diagonal ensembles (time-averaged dephased state), two ubiquitous steady states of many-body open dynamics. We then move to the specific problem of estimating the strength of a magnetic field via interacting spins and derive two-body interacting Hamiltonians that can approach the fundamental precision bounds. In this case, we additionally analyze the transient regime leading to the steady states and characterize tradeoffs between equilibration times and measurement precision. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive picture of the potential of many-body control in quantum sensing.

In analogue gravity studies, the goal is to replicate black hole phenomena, such as Hawking radiation, within controlled laboratory settings. In the realm of condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials based on honeycomb lattice. In particular, we compute the entropy of this system, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if an analogue horizon forms. Hence, these systems can be potential analogues of quantum black holes. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in the region where the tilt parameter is close to one, which corresponds to the location of the analogue black hole horizon. Additionally, when nonlinear effects are taken into account, the entropy is peaked in a small pocket of the Fermi sea that forms behind the analogue event horizon, which we call the \textit{Fermi puddle}. We further refer to this new type of analogue black hole as a {\it smart hole}, since, in contrast to dumb holes, it can simulate both the correct temperature {\it and} entropy of general relativistic black holes. These results provide an opportunity to illuminate various quantum facets of black hole physics in a laboratory setting.

Edge states emerging at the boundaries of materials with nontrivial topology are attractive for many practical applications due to their remarkable robustness to disorder and local boundary deformations, which cannot result in scattering of the energy of the edge states impinging on such defects into the bulk of material, as long as forbidden topological gap remains open in its spectrum. The velocity of the such states traveling along the edge of the topological insulator is typically determined by their Bloch momentum. In contrast, here, using valley Hall edge states forming at the domain wall between two honeycomb lattices with broken inversion symmetry, we show that by imposing Airy envelope on them one can construct edge states which, on the one hand, exhibit \textit{self-acceleration} along the boundary of the insulator despite their fixed Bloch momentum and, on the other hand, \textit{do not diffract} along the boundary despite the presence of localized features in their shapes. We construct both linear and nonlinear self-accelerating edge states, and show that nonlinearity considerably affects their envelopes. Such self-accelerating edge states exhibit self-healing properties typical for nondiffracting beams. Self-accelerating valley Hall edge states can circumvent sharp corners, provided the oscillating tail of the self-accelerating topological state is properly apodized by using an exponential function. Our findings open new prospects for control of propagation dynamics of edge excitations in topological insulators and allow to study rich phenomena that may occur upon interactions of nonlinear envelope topological states.

Understanding the precise interaction mechanisms between quantum systems and their environment is crucial for advancing stable quantum technologies, designing reliable experimental frameworks, and building accurate models of real-world phenomena. However, simulating open quantum systems, which feature complex non-unitary dynamics, poses significant computational challenges that require innovative methods to overcome. In this work, we introduce the tensor jump method (TJM), a scalable, embarrassingly parallel algorithm for stochastically simulating large-scale open quantum systems, specifically Markovian dynamics captured by Lindbladians. This method is built on three core principles where, in particular, we extend the Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method to matrix product states, use a dynamic time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) to significantly reduce errors during time evolution, and introduce what we call a sampling MPS to drastically reduce the dependence on the simulation's time step size. We demonstrate that this method scales more effectively than previous methods and ensures convergence to the Lindbladian solution independent of system size, which we show both rigorously and numerically. Finally, we provide evidence of its utility by simulating Lindbladian dynamics of XXX Heisenberg models up to a thousand spins using a consumer-grade CPU. This work represents a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale open quantum systems, with the potential to enable discoveries across various domains of quantum physics, particularly those where the environment plays a fundamental role, and to both dequantize and facilitate the development of more stable quantum hardware.

Zhao Zhang
It is shown that the conservation of a charge operator supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher order conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This establishes Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture as a theorem, ending the folklore that the existence of higher conserved charges imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.

Mingchen Zheng, Chenguang Liang, Shu Chen, Xin Zhang
Spin helix states-characterized by their spatially modulated spin textures-are exact eigenstates of the one-dimensional anisotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model under specific parameter conditions. In this work, we extend this framework by constructing exact spin helix eigenstates for the fully anisotropic XYZ Heisenberg model with arbitrary spatial dimensions and arbitrary spin quantum numbers. Our results demonstrate that some non-trivial exact eigenstates can persist beyond the integrable regime. The XXZ and XY cases are also analyzed to clarify the conditions for the emergence of spin helix eigenstates and their key properties. Our results broaden the class of analytically tractable exact eigenstates in non-integrable systems and deepen understanding of spin modulation states in many-body systems.

Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exotic many-body states that exhibit anomalous non-thermal behavior in an otherwise ergodic system. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable and intuitive construction of QMBS in a kinetically constrained quantum model exhibiting weak Hilbert space fragmentation. We show that exact QMBS can be constructed by injecting a quasiparticle that partially activates the frozen regions in the lattice. Meanwhile, the inelastic collision between multiple quasiparticles allows for the construction of approximate scars, whose damping is governed by an emergent two-body loss. Our findings establish direct connections between quantum many-body scarring and Hilbert space fragmentation, paving the way for systematically constructing exact and approximate QMBS with nontrivial spatial connectivity. The proposed model can be readily implemented in neutral-atom quantum simulators aided by strong Rydberg interactions.

We investigate cosmic structure formation in the framework of a path-integral formulation of an $N$-particle ensemble in phase space, dubbed Resummed Kinetic Field Theory (RKFT), up to one-loop perturbative order. In particular, we compute power spectra of the density contrast, the divergence and curl of the momentum density and arbitrary $n$-point cumulants of the stress tensor. In contrast to earlier works, we propose a different method of sampling initial conditions, with a Gaussian initial phase-space density. Doing so, we exactly reproduce the corresponding results from Eulerian standard perturbation theory (SPT) at one-loop order, showing that formerly found deviations can be fully attributed to inconsistencies in the previous sampling method. Since, in contrast to SPT, the full phase-space description does not assume a truncation of the Vlasov hierarchy, our findings suggest that non-perturbative techniques are required to accurately capture the physics of cosmic structure formation.
