Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are commonly required to have an energy gap, but recent work has extended the concept to gapless settings. This raises a natural question: what happens at transitions between inequivalent gapless SPTs? We address this for the simplest known case among gapless SPTs protected by a unitary symmetry group acting faithfully on the low-energy theory. To this end, we consider a qutrit version of the nearest-neighbor XX chain. Trimerizing the chain explicitly breaks an anomalous symmetry and produces three distinct gapped SPT phases protected by a unitary $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry. Their phase boundaries are given by three inequivalent gapless SPTs without any gapped symmetry sectors, each described by a symmetry-enriched version of an orbifolded Potts$^2$ conformal field theory with central charge $c=\frac{8}{5}$. We provide an analytic derivation of this critical theory in a particular regime and confirm its stability using tensor network simulations. Remarkably, the three gapless SPTs meet at a $c = 2$ multicritical point, where the protecting $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry exhibits a mixed anomaly with the $\mathbb Z_3$ entangler symmetry that permutes the SPT classes. We further explore how discrete gauging gives dipole-symmetric models, offering insights into dipole symmetry-breaking and SPTs, as well as symmetry-enriched multiversality. Altogether, this work uncovers a rich phase diagram of a minimal qutrit chain, whose purely nearest-neighbor interactions make it a promising candidate for experimental realization, including the prospect of critical phases with stable edge modes.

Abstract: We investigate the effects of disorder on a system that in the clean limit is a pair density wave (PDW) superconductor. The charge order of the clean PDW is inevitably lost (via Imry-Ma), but the fate of the superconducting order is less clear. Here, we consider a strongly inhomogeneous limit in which the system consists of a random collection of PDW puddles embedded in a metallic background. When the puddles are dilute, they become phase coherent at low temperatures, resulting in a state that is macroscopically equivalent to a charge-$2e$ $s$-wave superconductor. This can be viewed as an example of ``order parameter fractionalization'' -- the PDW order splits into a charge-2e s-wave superconductor and a charge density wave, the latter of which is destroyed by disorder -- and stands in contrast to the ``vestigial'' charge-4e superconductivity which has been proposed to arise in weakly disordered PDWs.

Abstract: State-of-the-art developments in magnetic devices rely on manufacturing faster, more efficient memory elements. A significant development in this direction has been the discovery of orbital torques, which employ the orbital angular momentum of Bloch electrons to switch the magnetisation of an adjacent ferromagnet, and has motivated the search for \textit{orbitronic} materials displaying strong orbital dynamics exemplified, by the orbital Hall effect (OHE). In this work we propose Ge, as an optimal orbitronic platform. We demonstrate that holes in bulk Ge exhibit a giant OHE, exceeding that of the bulk states of topological insulators, and exceeding the spin-Hall effect by four orders of magnitude. The calculation is performed within the framework of the Luttinger model and the modern theory of orbital magnetisation, while incorporating recently-discovered quantum corrections to the OHE. Our study constitutes a fundamental milestone in applying the modern theory to a system with \textit{inversion symmetry}. Moreover, we argue that bulk Ge serves as an ideal testbed for the orbital torque resulting from a charge current, since the spin- and orbital-Edelstein effects in Ge are forbidden by symmetry. Our results provide a blueprint for producing strong orbital torques in magnetic devices with Ge, guiding future experimental work in this direction.

Abstract: Generalized hydrodynamics is a framework to study the large scale dynamics of integrable models, special fine-tuned one-dimensional many-body systems that possess an infinite number of local conserved quantities. Unlike classical models, where the microscopic origins of generalized hydrodynamics are better understood, in quantum models it can only be derived using the hydrodynamic formalism. Using the paradigmatic and experimentally relevant repulsive Lieb-Liniger model as an example, this thesis introduces a new viewpoint on the dynamics of quantum integrable models by introducing so-called semi-classical Bethe models. These classical integrable models act as an intermediate description between the microscopic quantum realm and the macroscopic generalized hydrodynamics. After introducing these models and discussing their properties, we study the generalized hydrodynamics equation using new tools and show that solutions to the Euler generalized hydrodynamics equation of the Lieb-Liniger model exist, are unique and do not develop gradient catastrophes. Finally, we discuss new insights into the physics governing the diffusive correction, which, contrary to prior belief, is not described by a Navier-Stokes-like equation. Focusing on the main intuitive ideas, the thesis aims to provide a self-contained overview over these exciting new developments on generalized hydrodynamics.

Abstract: Two-dimensional systems in magnetic fields host rich physics, most notably the quantum Hall effect arising from Landau level quantization. In a broad class of two-dimensional models, flat bands with topologically nontrivial band degeneracies give rise to anomalous Landau level quantization under homogeneous fields. Ascribed to the underlying quantum geometry, these are classified as singular flat bands, exhibiting unusual wavefunction localization, and anomalous quantization of Landau levels. We investigate the response of gapless singular flat bands to inhomogeneous fluxes, bridging continuum and lattice descriptions. Our analysis reveals a mechanism to controllably manipulate the anomalous Landau levels via flux inhomogeneity. We further uncover an emergent supersymmetry in the parameter space where the tower of anomalous Landau levels collapses to zero energy, rendering a lattice analog of the Aharonov-Casher theorem on degenerate zero modes in perpendicular fluxes, with wavefunction localization partly similar to Aharonov-Bohm caging. With the addition of strong correlations, these findings will have implications for realizing exotic topological and charge-ordered phases.

Abstract: Despite extensive experimental and theoretical work over several decades, Schmid-Bulgadaev quantum phase transition remains a subject of debate. Here we revisit this problem by performing systematic experiments on low-frequency current-voltage characteristics of Josephson junctions over a wide range of parameters. The experiments are conducted in a true resistive environment formed by a metallic on-chip resistor located near the junction. Over the parameter range of the experiment, we find that the transition occurs when the resistance crosses the quantum value $h/(4e^2)\simeq 6.5$ k$\Omega$ for Cooper pairs, as originally predicted. The temperature $T$ of the experiment is naturally non-zero, but our basic theoretical modeling corroborates that the observations under these conditions can serve as the basis for the conclusions made, in particular, the crossover resistance from superconducting to insulating regime is the same as that at $T=0$.

Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) consist of two ferromagnetic layers that are antiferromagnetically coupled. These systems support complex dynamical magnetic excitations, where interlayer coupling gives rise to both in-phase (acoustic) and anti-phase (optical) magnonic modes. Typically, simultaneous excitation of both modes requires breaking the symmetry between the ferromagnetic layers -- commonly achieved through slight misalignment of the experimental setup or by modifying the intrinsic magnetic properties. In our approach, we utilize a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet (pSAF), where one of the ferromagnetic layers is exchange-coupled to an antiferromagnet. We demonstrate that by tuning the thickness of the antiferromagnet and slightly enhancing the magnetic anisotropy of the pinned layer, both acoustic and optical modes can be efficiently excited -- without the need for experimental misalignment or changes to the intrinsic material properties. Under specific conditions, the magnon dispersion relations exhibit anti-crossing behavior, resulting in the emergence of a magnonic bandgap -- a clear signature of strong magnon-magnon coupling. The coupling efficiency $\eta$, defined as the ratio between the bandgap and the characteristic frequency, reaches $\eta = 0.5$, approaching the ultra-strong coupling regime ($\eta = 1$). The combination of strong mode hybridization, a sizable magnonic bandgap, and high ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) coherence over large areas -- all achieved at room temperature without cryogenic cooling -- underscores the potential of these systems for quantum magnonic applications, including quantum computing.

Abstract: We present a detailed study of the real-time dynamics and spectral properties of the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model at infinite temperature. Using tensor network simulations in Liouville space, we compute the single-particle Green's function and analyze its dynamics across a broad range of interaction strengths. To complement the time-domain approach, we develop a high-resolution Chebyshev expansion method within the density matrix formalism, enabling direct access to spectral functions in the frequency domain. In the non-interacting limit, we derive exact analytical expressions for the Green's function, providing a benchmark for our numerical methods. As interactions are introduced, we observe a transition in the spectral function from a sharp peak at the free dispersion to a broadened two-band structure associated with hole and doublon excitations. These features are well captured by a Hubbard-I mean-field approximation, even at intermediate coupling. At infinite interaction strength ($U = \infty$), we exploit a determinant representation of the Green's function to access both real-time and spectral properties. In this regime, the system retains a sharp, cosine-like momentum dispersion in frequency space, while the dynamics display nontrivial light-cone spreading with sub-ballistic scaling. Our results demonstrate that strong correlations and nontrivial quantum coherence can persist even at infinite temperature.

Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties and the dynamics of doublons in the one-dimensional Hubbard model at infinite temperature. Using a Chebyshev expansion approach formulated in the superfermionic representation, we compute the momentum- and frequency-resolved doublon spectral function across a wide range of interaction strengths $U$ and in the presence of an external electric field. Increasing the interaction, the spectrum gradually splits into separate bands associated with two-hole and two-particle excitations. Despite the presence of strong correlations, we find that doublons retain their coherence and undergo long-lived Bloch oscillations, as well as rich quantum walk dynamics characterized by light-cone spreadings at strong coupling, which we analyze through the time-and space-resolved Green's function.

Abstract: Molecular computing promises massive parallelization to explore solution spaces, but so far practical implementations remain limited due to off-target binding and exponential proliferation of competing structures. Here, we investigate the theoretical limits of equilibrium self-assembly systems for solving computing problems, focusing on the directed Hamiltonian Path Problem (HPP) as a benchmark for NP-complete problems. The HPP is encoded via particles with directional lock-key patches, where self-assembled chains form candidate solution paths. We determine constraints on the required energy gap between on-target and off-target binding for the HPP to be encoded and solved. We simultaneously examine whether components with the required energy gap can be designed. Combining these results yields a phase diagram identifying regions where HPP instances are both encodable and solvable. These results establish fundamental upper bounds on equilibrium molecular computation and highlight the necessity of non-equilibrium approaches for scalable molecular computing architectures.

Abstract: Rational material design by elemental substitution is useful in tailoring materials to have desirable properties. Here we consider three non-equivalent substitutional series based on Co$_2$FeGe, viz; (Co$_{2-\alpha}$Mn$_\alpha$)FeGe, Co$_2$(Fe$_{1-\beta}$Mn$_{\beta}$)Ge, (Co$_{2-\alpha}$Fe$_\alpha$)MnGe ($0\!\le\!\alpha\!\le\!2, 0\!\le\!\beta\!\le\!1$), and study how material properties evolve with the interchange of Mn, Fe, and Co in Co$_2$FeGe. In all three schemes, single-phase compounds can be obtained over a wide range of compositions: $0.125 < \alpha < 1.375 $ for (Co$_{2-\alpha}$Mn$_{\alpha}$)FeGe, $0 \!\le\! \beta \!\le\! 1$ for Co$_2$(Fe$_{1-\beta}$Mn$_{\beta}$)Ge, and $0 \!<\! \alpha \!<\! 1.50$ for (Co$_{2-\alpha}$Fe$_\alpha$)MnGe. All the single-phase compounds crystallise in fcc structure with chemical ordering consistent with the ``4-2'' rule of Butler et al. The compounds are soft ferromagnets with low temperature saturation magnetisation agreeing with the Slater-Pauling rule. Very high Curie temperatures are measured, with values up to 1000 K for lower Mn concentrations. First principle calculations indicate, in the most stable atomic configuration, Mn prefers sharing sublattice with Ge, also consistent with the 4-2 rule. The calculations further predict half-metallic behaviour for (Co$_{1.625}$Mn$_{0.375}$)FeGe, while finding other compositions to be nearly half-metallic. Upon comparing the results of the three series, it is found that single-phase alloys occur for a specific range of valence electrons per unit cell ($\sim\!28.5\!-\!29.75$), and that even for multi-phase samples the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties depend primarily on the number of valence electrons and not on the specific substitution scheme employed.

Abstract: Elastic networks can be tuned to exhibit complex mechanical responses and have been extensively used to study protein allosteric functionality, where a localized strain regulates the conformation at a distant site. We show that cooperative binding, where two sites each enhance the other's ability to function, can be trained via a symmetric application of the training previously employed for creating network allostery. We identify a crossover temperature above which cooperative functionality breaks down due to thermal fluctuations. We develop a modified training protocol to increase this crossover temperature, enabling function to remain robust at biologically relevant temperatures.

Abstract: Stimulated scattering of incoherent excitons into an exciton-polariton mode leads to the build-up of a polariton condensate whose polarization is sensitive to a small seeded population that triggers the stimulated process. We show, within a semiclassical stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii model, that this mechanism enables a robust polarization memory operation: the condensate tends to align its Stokes vector with that of the seed and to maintain it for times far exceeding an individual polariton lifetime. Importantly, this single-photon-seeded regime is modeled as an initial weak excitation of the condensate mode. We quantify the memory performance by a classical polarization-alignment metric and find that the seed polarization can remain well preserved on a nanosecond timescale under realistic parameters.

Abstract: We investigate a Brownian heat engine wherein a particle moves through a periodic ratchet potential under an exponentially decreasing temperature profile, a spatial configuration that closely resembles experimentally realizable conditions such as laser-induced thermal gradients and thermoplasmonic heating. This model yields exact analytical expressions for the particle current, thermodynamic efficiency, entropy production, and coefficient of performance (COP), and uniquely recovers the Curzon Ahlborn efficiency and the corresponding endoreversible COP exactly in the quasistatic limit. These findings provide a rare and rigorous realization of endoreversible thermodynamics at the mesoscopic scale because they are derived directly from microscopic stochastic dynamics without recourse to phenomenological assumptions, asymptotic approximations or coarse-graining techniques. Although the derived efficiency and COP are exact, they remain strictly below the Carnot limit, reflecting the inherent irreversibility embedded within the endoreversible framework. Furthermore, we show that in comparison to linear and piecewise-constant temperature profile cases, the exponential temperature profile leads to significantly higher particle velocities, higher entropy production, but lower thermodynamic efficiency, which underscores the fundamental trade-off between transport speed and energy cost.

Abstract: Modern energy applications, especially electric vehicles, demand high energy batteries. However, despite decades of intensive efforts, the highest energy density and commercially viable batteries are still based on LiCoO2, the very first generation of cathode materials. The technical bottleneck is the stability of oxide-based cathodes at high operating voltages. The fundamental puzzle is that we actually never understood the redox mechanism of LiCoO2. Conventional wisdom generally defines redox to be centered on cations at low voltages, and on anions, i.e. oxygen, at high voltages by forming oxidized chemical states like O2 or peroxo-species. Here, through in-situ and ex-situ spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations, we show that high-energy layered cathodes, represented by LiCoO2 and LiNiO2, operate through enhancement of negative charge transfer (NCT) ground states upon charging throughout the whole voltage range - i.e., NCT evolution itself is the intrinsic redox mechanism regardless of voltage ranges. NCT inherently engages high covalency and oxygen holes, leading to optimized performance without conventional redox centers in LiCoO2. The level of NCT, i.e., number of ligand holes, naturally explains many seemingly controversial results. The redefinition of redox mechanism reveals the pathway toward viable high energy battery electrodes.

arXiv:2509.20647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical current fluctuations provide a powerful and unconventional probe of band geometry in quantum materials. In particular, intrinsic noise components that are independent of the relaxation time reveal universal band-geometric properties of Bloch electrons. Here, we identify a distinct intrinsic contribution to current noise at second order in the electric field, which is governed by the quantum metric. This effect arises from field-induced modifications to Bloch wavefunctions and band energies, and it dominates in PT-symmetric antiferromagnets where Berry curvature based contributions are forbidden by symmetry. Applying our theory to CuMnAs, we demonstrate that thermal noise provides a direct signature of quantum metric in PT-symmetric antiferromagnets.

Abstract: We investigated the superconducting (SC) properties of Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti high-entropy alloy (HEA) thin films with 0.5% weight C additives. The C additives stabilize the structural properties and enhance the SC critical properties, including $\mu_0$Hc$_2$ (13.45 T) and Tc (7.5 K). The reflectance of the C-added HEA film is enhanced in the low-energy region, resulting in a higher optical conductivity, which is consistent with the lower electrical resistivity. In addition, we observed SC vortices in the C-added HEA film using magnetic force microscopy. The magnetic penetration depths ($\lambda$) of the pure HEA and C-added HEA films were estimated from their Meissner force curves by comparing them with those of a reference Nb film. At 4.2 K, the {\lambda} of the C-added film is 360 nm, shorter than that of the pure HEA film (560 nm), indicating stronger superconductivity against an applied magnetic field.

Abstract: Accurate understanding and control of interfacial adhesion between Cu and Ta$_x$N diffusion barriers are essential for ensuring the mechanical reliability and integrity of Cu interconnect systems in semiconductor devices. Amorphous tantalum nitride (a-Ta$_x$N) barriers are particularly attractive due to their superior barrier performance, attributed to the absence of grain boundaries. However, a systematic atomistic investigation of how varying Ta stoichiometries influences adhesion strength at Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces remains lacking, hindering a comprehensive understanding of interface optimization strategies. In this study, we employ machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to perform steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations of Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces. We simultaneously evaluate three distinct interface construction approaches--static relaxation, high-temperature annealing, and simulated Cu deposition--to comprehensively investigate their influence on adhesion strength across varying Ta compositions ($x=1, 2, 4$). Peak force and work of adhesion values from SMD simulations quantitatively characterize interface strength, while atomic stress and strain analyses elucidate detailed deformation behavior, highlighting the critical role of interfacial morphologies. Additionally, we explore the atomistic mechanisms underlying cohesive failure, revealing how targeted incorporation of Ta atoms into Cu layers enhances the cohesive strength of the interface. This study demonstrates how MLIP-driven simulations can elucidate atomic-scale relationships between interface morphology and adhesion behavior, providing insights that can guide future atomistic engineering strategies toward enhancing intrinsic barrier adhesion, potentially enabling liner-free interconnect technologies.

arXiv:2509.20672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hydrogenated graphene (HC6) represents a promising platform for exploring emergent electronic phases. Owing to its high electronic density of states at the Fermi level, HC6 is expected to support phonon-mediated superconductivity, with a calculated critical temperature Tc of 37.4 K in the paramagnetic metallic phase. However, spin-polarized first-principles calculations reveal that HC6 stabilizes in a ferrimagnetic ground state, which is energetically favored by 0.175 eV per unit cell over the paramagnetic metallic phase. This large energy difference significantly exceeds kB T at room temperature, indicating robust magnetic order. Although the superconducting condensation energy lowers the total energy by about 7 meV, the superconducting phase remains metastable. These results highlight the dominant role of magnetism in HC6 and illustrate how a high electronic density of states can drive competing instabilities in hydrogenated two-dimensional materials, offering design principles for carbon-based magnetic systems.

Abstract: Altermagnetism is characterized by non-relativistic spin splitting and zero total magnetic moments. In this work, intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metallic and topological phases were discovered within the ferrovalley states of sliding bilayer altermagnets. We construct the bilayer system by utilizing altermagnet monolayers with a small bandgap. The inter-layer hopping phenomenon leads to a reduction in bandgaps, and sliding engineering induces ferrovalley states. Taking the V$_2$OSSe system for example, first-principles calculations indicate that the spin-dependent inter-layer hopping in the ferrovalley state ensures a direct gap in one valley (one spin channel) and band inversion in the other valley (opposite spin channel), which is manifested as an intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metal. The microscopic model and effective Hamiltonian employed in this research confirm the universal spin-dependent inter-layer hopping in the sliding altermagnet bilayer. Further calculations imply the existence of Chern insulator and gapless surface states in the sliding altermagnet bilayer. Adjusting the sliding direction can achieve the transition between different half-metals with conducting electrons of different spins, accompanied by the switching of gapless surface states of opposite spins. This research lays a foundation for the potential applications of intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metals and topological phases in spintronics.

arXiv:2509.20700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the particle-scale dynamics that give rise to bulk flow behaviours of highly concentrated particle-fluid mixtures using discrete element method (DEM) simulations. We utilize boundary conditions of a stress-controlled shear cell and vary material properties and applied stresses systematically. We find the bulk rheology transitions smoothly among what might be called viscous, collisional, and visco-collisional behaviours based on average shear rate dependence as well as dominance of local interaction. Using specific measures of particle-scale dynamics, we find that the transitions in system rheologies coincide with statistically significant changes in the ``fabric'' (i.e., strong force network and coordination numbers), the ``granular temperature'' (i.e., fluctuation energy) and relative importance of fluid and interparticle contacts. Armed with these measures and previous theoretical work, we provide a foundation for understanding the particle-scale physics that gives rise to meso-scale rheologies and transitions from one to the next. We determine physics-based formulations to better represent dynamic behaviors for a wide range of material properties and loading conditions. Our study broadens the applicability of rheological models to natural and engineered systems by providing a foundation for a more general constitutive model.

Abstract: High-T$_c$ superconductivity has recently been discovered in Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates under pressure, where the low-energy electronic structure is dominated by Ni $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. However, the respective roles of these orbitals in superconductivity remain unclear. Here, by combining X-ray absorption, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations on La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ single crystals, we identify ligand holes in the $p_{x,y}$ orbitals of planar oxygen and the $p_z$ orbitals of apical oxygen, which hybridize with the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, respectively. These ligand holes enable orbital-selective O K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study, which reveals that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states dominate the low-energy charge excitations and are more itinerant. We also observe a $\sim$0.1 eV bimagnon through RIXS and Raman spectroscopy, which leads to an interlayer superexchange interaction J$_z$ of $\sim$50 meV. Our results reveal distinct contributions of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals to the electronic and magnetic structure and provide direct experimental insights to understand the RP-phase nickelate superconductors.

Abstract: We introduce families of classical stochastic dynamics in two and higher dimensions which stabilize order in the absence of any symmetry. Our dynamics are qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, and have the unusual feature of being fluctuation-stabilized: their order becomes increasingly fragile in larger dimensions. One of our models maintains an ordered phase only in two dimensions. The phase transitions that occur as the order is lost realize new dynamical universality classes which are fundamentally non-equilibrium in character.

Abstract: Recent studies of hydrogen-dominant (superhydride) materials, such as LaH10 have led to putative discoveries of near-room temperature superconductivity at high pressures, with a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 250 K observed at 170 GPa. While these findings are promising, achieving such high superconductivity requires challenging experimental conditions typically exceeding 100 GPa. In this study, we utilize first-principles calculations and Migdal-Eliashberg theory to examine the superconducting properties of the stable boron-based compound YB2 at atmospheric pressure, where yttrium and boron atoms form a layered structure. Our results indicate that YB2 exhibits a Tc of 2.14 K at 0 GPa. We find that doping with additional electrons (0 to 0.3) leads to a monotonic decrease in Tc as the electron concentration increases. Conversely, introducing holes significantly enhances Tc, raising it to 22.83 K. Although our findings do not surpass the superconducting temperature of the well-known MgB2, our doping strategy highlights a method for tuning electron-phonon coupling strength in metal borides. This insight could be valuable for future experi-mental applications. Overall, this study not only deepens our understanding of YB2 superconducting properties but also contributes to the ongoing search for high-temperature superconductors.

arXiv:2509.20759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-energy encodes the fundamental lifetime of quasiparticle excitations. In one dimension, it is known to display anomalous behavior at zero temperature for interacting fermions, reflecting the breakdown of Fermi-liquid theory. Here we show that the self-energy is also anomalous in the infinite temperature Hubbard chain, where thermal fluctuations are maximal. Focusing on the second order ring diagram, we find that the imaginary part of the self-energy diverges non-perturbatively: as a power law with exponent $-1/3$ near half filling, and logarithmically away from it. These divergences imply anomalous temporal relaxation of Green's functions, confirmed by infinite temperature tensor-network simulations. Our results demonstrate that anomalous relaxation and the breakdown of perturbation theory survive even at maximal entropy, which can be observed in cold-atom experiments probing the Hubbard chain at high temperatures.

Abstract: Magnon-exciton coupling provides an unprecedented opportunity for the optical tunability of spin information and, viceversa, for the magnetic control of the optical response. Few-layered magnets are an ideal platform for the experimental study of this coupling, in part due to the strong excitonic character of the optical response in (quasi-)two dimensions. Here, we demonstrate a strong dependence of the excitonic oscillator strength on the magnetic order in a monolayer of chromium trichloride CrCl$_3$. Solving an effective Bethe-Salpeter equation, we evaluate the changes in the excitonic response as the magnetic order switches from the ferromagnetic state to the antiferromagnetic state when strain is applied. Our results reveal an abrupt change in the spatial localization of the excitons across the transition, which translates into a strong shift and a change of the oscillator strength of the excitonic peaks. This suggests the possibility of using strain as a binary switch of the optical response in this material.

arXiv:2509.20765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discovered unique uniaxial negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior for a weak-itinerant-ferromagnetic phase of CoZr$_{2}$H$_{3.49}$. CoZr$_{2}$ is known as a superconductor exhibiting uniaxial NTE along the $c$-axis, which is called anomalous thermal expansion (ATE). Additionally, CoZr$_{2}$ is also known as a well-absorbent of hydrogen, and hydrogen insertion raises weak-itinerant ferromagnetism instead of superconductivity. However, the influence of hydrogen insertion on ATE behavior in this system is still unclear. To investigate it, we performed powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) for CoZr$_{2}$H$_{3.49}$. Through Arrott plots analysis, we determined the Curie temperature ($T_{\mathrm{C}}$) to be 139 K, and the Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio was estimated to be 3.49, which clearly exceeds 1, suggesting the itinerancy of emerging ferromagnetism. Temperature dependencies of lattice constants $a$ and $c$ were extracted from powder SXRD analyses, and we revealed that lattice constant $c$ exhibited NTE behavior below $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. The uniaxial NTE behavior along the $c$-axis can be understood by sharpening an antibonding Co3$dz^{2}$ partial density of states near the Fermi level, linked to the expansion of a one-dimensional Co-Co chain running parallel to the $c$-axis.

Abstract: A spin supersolid is characterized by the simultaneous breaking of lattice translation and continuous spin rotation symmetries. In this work, we study a spin-1 model with $U(2)\cong SU(2)\times U(1)/Z_2$ symmetry on the triangular lattice, and the phase diagram is figured out using a variational $\mathbb CP^2$ approach. We identify a novel $SU(2)$-supersolid phase which contains a 3-sublattice solid order and a spin-superfluid order. Unlike usual supersolid phases having noncollinear magnetic order and only one Goldstone mode, the $SU(2)$-supersolid phase has collinear Neel order and two Goldstone modes. Another important feature of this supersolid is that the magnon excitation spectrum has symmetry protected double degeneracy in the whole Brillouin zone. As by-products, several other ordered phases are obtained, including the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic states breaking the $SU(2)$ symmetry, as well as genuine phases that completely breaks the $U(2)$ symmetry. Furthermore, the instabilities of $SU(3)$-flavor linear spin-wave theory are consistent with the phase boundaries between different ordered phases. %dispersions confirm the stability of the classically ordered phases and provides insights into their excitation spectra.

Abstract: Superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators with high internal quality factors (\Q_i) are essential for quantum information applications, but suffer severe Qi degradation under magnetic fields due to quasiparticle generation and vortex-induced losses. We fabricated and characterized Nb, NbTi, and NbTiN SCPW resonators with varying film thicknesses under different temperatures and in-plane magnetic fields (\(B_{\parallel}\)). Temperature-dependent transmission measurements agree well with Mattis-Bardeen theory, revealing kinetic inductance parameters. Comparative analysis shows that 45-nm-thick NbTi resonators maintain \(Q_i = 1.01 \times 10^{4}\) at (\(B_{\parallel}\)) = 0.4 T, satisfying the dual requirements of high Qi and strong field resilience. Owing to its moderate kinetic inductance and compatibility with conventional photolithography, NbTi emerges as a practical material platform for field-resilient SCPW resonators and hybrid quantum circuits operating in magnetic environments.

arXiv:2509.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assemblies of ring DNA and proteins, such as kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) and the chainmail-like network of the HK97 bacteriophage capsid, form "Olympic" topologies that govern the dynamics of gene-regulatory proteins, cellular metabolites, and viral genomes. Yet the pore sizes that control transport and diffusion in these topologically linked networks remain poorly quantified. Here, using coarse-grained simulations of idealized square (SQR) and hexagonal (HEX) lattice catenated two-dimensional Olympic networks, we measure pore size as the radius of the largest rigid tracer that can pass through an aperture and delineate how backbone bending stiffness and topological tension regulate this structure. We identify two competing regulators: (i) ring entropic elasticity, which enlarges pores at low stiffness, and (ii) ring rotation angle, which reduces pore size at high stiffness. Their competition yields bimodal pore size distributions over a defined parameter range. Network geometry further modulates spatial correlations in pore size and the pore size autocorrelation time, predicting distinct propagation of perturbations in isostatic (SQR) versus hypostatic (HEX) architectures. These results provide testable predictions for enzyme diffusion kinetics and cargo release in natural or synthetic catenane DNA networks and mechanically interlocked capsid proteins, and offer a theoretical framework for interpreting FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) and SMT (single-molecule tracking) measurements in topologically catenated biopolymer networks.

arXiv:2509.20828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hafnium dioxide (HfO2) is a CMOS-compatible ferroelectric showing both 180{\deg} and 90{\deg} switching, yet the microscopic nature of the 90{\deg} pathway remains unresolved. We show that the 90{\deg} rotation pathway, negligible in pristine HfO2, becomes dominant under E// [111] when induced by charged oxygen vacancies. This pathway is more fatigue-resistant than the 180{\deg} reversal pathway, while delivering the same polarization change along [111] (2Pr=60 {\mu}C/cm^2 ). This charge-driven switching arises from two factors: the crystal geometry of HfO2 and the intrinsic nature of rotational pathways, the latter suggesting a possible general tendency for defect charge to bias rotation over reversal in ferroelectrics. Together these findings reveal a pathway-level origin of fatigue resistance and establish defect charge as a general control parameter for polarization dynamics.

arXiv:2509.20834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays an important role in the topological band theory. In contrary, study on the topological properties of the asymmetric systems is rather limited, especially in higher-dimensional systems. In this work, we explore a new theory to study the topology in various one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) asymmetric systems with chiral boundary states. Starting from the simple SSHm model, we show the chiral topology of its edge states by redefining sublattices. Meanwhile, based on its Rice-Mele-like effective Hamiltonian, a new topological invariant $\bar{Z}$ can be defined and the bulk-edge correspondence is established. With this clear physical picture, our theory can be extended to the more complex asymmetric ladder models, or even the 2D asymmetric systems. In the 2D BBH3 model, new chiral corner states with redefined lattices are found based on our method. These corner states are independent of any spatial symmetry and exhibit the characteristics of topological bound states in the continuum (TBICs). Moreover, the topological invariant can be calculated by introducing $\bar{Z}$ into 2D. At last, we propose an acoustic experiment of the BBH3 model where chiral corner states are numerically observed. Our work exhibits a new approach to study the topological properties of asymmetric systems. By redefining sublattices, we find that the models with entirely different structures might share the same topological origins.

Abstract: By means of the first-principles density functional theory (DFT), I2-II-IV-VI4 type Cu-based quaternary chalcogenides Cu 2 XSiS 4 (X = Ge, Sn, and Pb) have been thoroughly investigated. We report the study of Ge and Sn substitution in the divalent cation site for their potential applications in photovoltaics for the first time. The structural, electronic, optical, and mechanical properties have been calculated. The structural and thermal stability is verified by calculating the elastic constants, formation energy and total potential energy at 300 K from the ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The compounds under our investigation exhibited an indirect band gap in the range of 1.0--1.56 eV, suitable for energy harvesting by trapping the sunlight. The presence of absorption peaks within the visible region complements their potential in photovoltaic applications. For further validation, we have designed a model of a heterostructure (FTO/TiO2/Cu2XSiS4/CuO/Au) solar cell, and a numerical simulation has been performed by solving the Poisson equation and continuity equations to obtain the I-V characteristic by using SCAPS-1D. All the inputs needed for solar- cell simulation in SCAPS-1D have been taken from the DFT results. The corresponding Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) is denoted by {\eta}% and their respective values for X=Ge, Sn and Pb are 23.46%, 23.29% and 22.60%, at room temperature. The Ge-based system exhibits the highest {\eta}%, owing to its band gap value in the visible range of the solar spectrum. Thus, we report that Ge-based compounds may act as a promising absorber layer in heterostructure solar-cell applications.

Abstract: To predict the complex chemical evolution in multicomponent alloys, it is highly desirable to have accurate atomistic simulation methods capable of reaching sufficiently large spatial and temporal scales. In this work, we advance the recently proposed SMC-X method through distributed computation on either GPUs or CPUs, pushing both spatial and temporal scales of atomistic simulation of chemically complex alloys to previously inaccessible scales. This includes a 16-billion-atom HEA system extending to the micrometer regime in space, and a 1-billion-atom HEA evolved over more than three million Monte Carlo swap steps, approaching the minute regime in time. We show that such large-scale simulations are essential for bridging the gap between experimental observations and theoretical predictions of the nanoprecipitate sizes in HEAs, based on analysis using the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory for diffusion-controlled coarsening. This work demonstrates the great potential of SMC-X for simulation-driven exploration of the chemical complexity in high-entropy materials at large spatial and temporal scales.

arXiv:2509.20951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic constants are central material properties, frequently reported in experimental and theoretical studies. While their computation is straightforward in the absence of thermal fluctuations, finite--temperature methods often suffer from poor signal--to--noise ratios or the presence of strong anharmonic effects. Here, we show how to compute elastic constants in thermal ordered and disordered systems by generalizing a noise--cancellation method originally developed for piezoelectric coupling coefficients. A slight strain is applied to an equilibrated solid. Simulations of both the strained and unstrained (or oppositely strained) reference systems are performed using identical thermostatting schemes. As demonstrated theoretically and with generic one--dimensional models, this allows stress differences to be evaluated and elastic constants to be determined with much reduced thermal noise. We then apply this approach across a diverse set of systems, spanning crystalline argon, ordered silicon as well as amorphous silicon, poly(methyl methacrylate), and cellulose derivatives.

Abstract: Solid-state qubits are sensitive to their microscopic environment, causing the qubit properties to fluctuate on a wide range of timescales. The sub-Hz end of the spectrum is usually dealt with by repeated background calibrations, which bring considerable overhead. It is thus important to characterize and understand the low-frequency variations of the relevant qubit characteristics. In this study, we investigate the stability of spin qubit frequencies in the Si/SiGe quantum dot platform. We find that the calibrated qubit frequencies of a six-qubit device vary by up to $\pm 100$ MHz while performing a variety of experiments over a span of 912 days. These variations are sensitive to the precise voltage settings of the gate electrodes, however when these are kept constant to within 15 $\mathrm{\mu}$V, the qubit frequencies vary by less than $\pm 7$ MHz over periods up to 36 days. During overnight scans, the qubit frequencies of ten qubits across two different devices show a standard deviation below 200 kHz within a 1-hour time window. The qubit frequency noise spectral density shows roughly a $1/f$ trend above $10^{-4}$ Hz and, strikingly, a steeper trend at even lower frequencies.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of springback and formability in sheet metal forming requires understanding reverse loading behavior under complex loading path changes, such as tension followed by compression. However, for ultra-thin sheets experimental characterization of such behavior is difficult due to compressive instability like plastic buckling. This study presents a crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) incorporating a physically motivated back stress model based on geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) and boundaries (GNBs). The model captures grain size effects, including the Hall-Petch and Bauschinger effects, through a single grain size-dependent back stress parameter, enabling reverse loading prediction using only tensile data from specimens with different grain sizes. The back stress parameter was calibrated by fitting tensile stress-strain curves from two microstructures - one as-received and one annealed. Without using Tension-Compression (T-C) data for calibration, the model accurately predicted reverse loading behavior in low-carbon steel (0.64 mm thick) and Tension-Bending (T-B) responses in ultra-thin SUS316 (0.083 mm thick) when the developed theory was incorporated to an upscaled anisotropic hardening model. Identifiability analysis confirmed that the model parameters are uniquely determined by the available data. This physically interpretable framework provides an efficient and robust means to predict reverse loading in thin metal sheets, overcoming experimental limitations.

Abstract: Ferromagnetism in the single-orbital Hubbard model, which contains only local Coulomb repulsion and no explicit ferromagnetic exchange interactions, has been extensively studied. However, how the associated fluctuations influence the electronic properties near the transition remains a fundamental issue. Here, by applying the dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A) to single-orbital systems with a partially flat band dispersion, we demonstrate that finite-correlation-length ferromagnetic fluctuations generate an emergent Luttinger surface and drive a Fermi surface expansion reminiscent of exchange splitting, even without magnetic order. We further derive an analytical expression that reproduces these effects, clarifying the microscopic origin for fluctuation-driven exchange splitting in correlated electron systems.

Abstract: Graphite is the most widely used anode material in lithium-ion batteries with over 98% market share. However, despite its first application over 30 years ago, the lithium insertion processes and associated dynamics in graphite remain poorly understood, especially for the dilute stages. A fundamental understanding of how the symmetry-breaking phase transitions occur pseudo-continuously under operating conditions is still lacking. Here, we provide a unified picture of ion intercalation dynamics during the dilute stages of graphite intercalation, using operando optical microscopy combined with random field Ising modelling. We show that during the dilute stages, single graphite particle undergoes rapid, localised avalanche-like (de)intercalation, leading to micron-sized regions (de)intercalating within seconds. These avalanches are reminiscent of phase transition behaviour seen in disordered materials such as martensitic transformations, Barkhausen noise and ferroelectric/elastic materials - associated with step changes in the order parameter, where the system changes from one phase to another under an applied driving force by jumping from one metastable state to another. Here, using a modified random field Ising model, we relate these avalanches to static disorder in graphite, which disrupts ion filling dynamics, leading to pseudo-continuous transitions between stages, accounting for the experimental electrochemistry profile as well as the temperature dependent avalanche dynamics. Finally, we develop a methodology to spatio-temporally analyse avalanches between intraparticle regions, revealing spatially heterogeneous connectivity and temporal patterns between regions during the dilute stages. Our work highlights the role of local and static disorder in eliciting unexpected phase transition behaviour, and provides new tools and concepts for studying layered battery materials.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) indium selenide (InSe) is a layered semiconductor with high electron mobility and a tunable band gap ranging from 1.25 eV in the bulk to 2.8 eV in the monolayer limit. These properties make these materials strong candidates for future logic and optoelectronic devices. However, growing phase-pure InSe remains challenging due to the complex indium-selenium (In-Se) phase diagram. This complexity and the sensitivity of chemical precursors to growth conditions make it difficult to control which In-Se phase forms during synthesis during, e.g., metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Despite the challenges, MOCVD is considered the most promising approach for growing InSe, as it enables wafer-scale, uniform, and controllable deposition-key requirements for device integration. In this study, we present a systematic investigation of InSe synthesis via MOCVD on c-plane sapphire substrates at low temperatures, which are highly relevant for various integration schemes. By varying the Se/In precursor ratio and the growth temperature, we create a phase diagram that covers the In-rich, equal stoichiometric, and Se-rich InxSey phases. Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, supported by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy, confirm conditions, under which the formation of 2D InSe is observed. Atomically-resolved cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy also reveals an epitaxial alignment of the InSe with the sapphire substrate mediated by a specific interface reconstruction. The epitaxial alignment is verified by in-plane X-ray diffraction across large length scales. Samples grown under optimized conditions exhibit a strong optical absorption in the visible range and especially a comparably high electron mobility underlining the potential of the MOCVD-grown material for future applications.

Abstract: The ability to optically trap and manipulate artificial microswimmers such as active Janus particles (JPs) provides a breakthrough in active matter research and applications. However, it presents significant challenges because of the asymmetry in the optical properties of JPs and remains incomprehensible. Illustrating the interplay between optical and thermophoretic forces, we demonstrate dynamically stable optical trapping of Pt-silica JPs, where the force-balanced position evolves spontaneously within a localized volume around the focal point and in a vertically shifted annular confinement at low and high laser powers, respectively. Intriguingly, the orientational and orbital dynamics of JP remain strongly coupled in the delocalized confinement. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous optical trapping of multiple JPs. This first report on thermophoresis of Pt-silica JPs and localized-to-delocalized crossover in the position distributions of an optically trapped active JP, verifying theoretical predictions, advances our understanding on confined active matter and their experimental realizations.

Abstract: The recent report of signs of room-temperature superconductivity in ultrathin single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) of types (2,1) and (3,0) holds significant promise for energy applications due to their ability to conduct current without dissipation. However, the McMillan Tc formula fails to calculate their superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) accurately, which raises an important question: what is the pairing mechanism driving their room-temperature superconductivity? To explore this further, we first investigate whether the strong curvature of ultrathin CNT leads to exotic phenomena in unconventional superconductors. If no evidence of these exotic characteristics is found and the McMillan formalism indicates that it is not a BCS-type superconductor, could we be observing a new class of unconventional superconductivity that functions independently of phonons and typical exotic features? In this paper, we demonstrate that factors such as the chiral angle of CNT, boron dopants and lattice regularity can be used to tune the theoretical Tc to experimental values. Our finding suggests that combining CNT with a harder substrate could be vital for further enhancing Tc while minimizing lattice distortion under doping. We propose a reconsideration of the common belief regarding whether the McMillan and BCS Tc formulas are adequate for classifying materials as BCS or non-BCS superconductors.

Abstract: We develop a self-consistent microscopic framework beyond mean-field theory for superconductivity in cuprates. It couples fermionic quasiparticles with collective phase dynamics to treat the superconducting gap and superfluid stiffness. The phase sector explicitly incorporates both smooth bosonic Nambu-Goldstone phase fluctuations, renormalized by long-range Coulomb interactions, and topological Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-type vortex-antivortex fluctuations. The required input is the correlated single-particle spectral function, enabling direct interfacing with Hubbard-type models. The framework provides quantitative access to key superconducting observables, including $T$-dependent gap and phase stiffness, gap-closing temperature $T_{\rm os}$, and transition temperature $T_c$, across wide ranges of doping. Using a recently proposed solvable interaction model as input, our simulations reveal several important features consistent with experimental observations in the cuprates: a $d$-wave superconducting dome in the $T$-$p$ phase diagram with a shoulder-like anomaly in the underdoped regime, a pronounced separation between $T_c$ and $T_{\rm os}$ signaling preformed Cooper pairing, a finite uncondensed normal component persisting even at $T=0$, and the onset temperature $T_{\rm on,vortex}$ of vortex signals, offering a consistent understanding of how strong correlations and phase fluctuations cooperate to shape high-$T_c$ superconductivity.

While dynamic heterogeneity (DH) and dynamic facilitation (DF) have been widely studied in two-dimensional amorphous materials, their prevalence in three-dimensional (3D) granular systems remains unclear. Here, we performed a 3D triaxial compression test with in-situ X-ray computed tomography to track particle-scale kinematics across small and large strain increments. We analyzed deviatoric strain, volumetric strain, and non-affine motion fields, computed four-point spatial dynamic correlation functions to probe DH, quantified DF through a facilitation ratio, and assessed temporal persistence of local dynamics using four-point temporal dynamic correlations. Across large strain increments, DH and DF emerge strongly in the transition regime between the initially elastic response and the critical state regime, but weaken or become statistically insignificant within the shear band at the critical state, indicating a qualitative change in microscale dynamics upon localization. In contrast, under small increments, both measures are suppressed across all regimes. These results demonstrate that correlated dynamics depend strongly on both strain increment and deformation regime. This work provides the first comprehensive investigation of DH and DF in 3D granular materials and highlights their strain-increment and regime-dependent behaviors, establishing a connection to glassy dynamics in amorphous solids.

Abstract: Generating spin magnetization and spin currents without magnetic or electric fields is a key frontier in spin caloritronics. Spin responses driven by thermal gradients offer a promising route, though the band geometric origin of intrinsic mechanisms, especially in non-magnetic materials, remains poorly understood. Here we develop a unified quantum theory of thermal spin magnetization and spin currents in itinerant electrons, rooted in spin band geometry with both Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea contributions. We identify two key geometric quantities: the spin-velocity metric tensor, which governs thermal spin magnetization, and the spin geometric tensor, combining spin Berry curvature and spin quantum metric, which generates thermal spin currents. These intrinsic contributions persist and can even dominate in non-magnetic insulators. Numerical calculations for chiral metal RhGe and antiferromagnet CuMnAs demonstrate sizable thermal spin responses near band crossings. Our results establish the band geometric origin of thermal spin transport and provide guiding principles for discovering and engineering next-generation spin caloritronic materials.

Abstract: In modern two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene-based systems and atomically-thin transition-metal dichalcogenides, the interplay of strong electronic correlations, tunable moir\'e superlattices, and nontrivial band topology has given rise to rich phase diagrams and collective phenomena. Among the novel phases that have been realized, electronic crystals -- states of matter in which itinerant electrons spontaneously crystallize -- play a particularly prominent role. In this Review, we summarize the current status of electron crystallization in van der Waals heterostructures, with emphasis on the experimental platforms and measurement techniques that enable their study. We also highlight open questions and outline future directions that may elucidate more of the fascinating properties of electronic crystals.

Abstract: Discrete time quasicrystals (DTQC) constitute a class of non-equilibrium matter characterized by temporal order without strict periodicity, in contrast to conventional time crystals. Investigating these phenomena is essential for expanding our fundamental understanding of far-from-equilibrium quantum matter and spontaneous symmetry breaking beyond periodic regimes. Here, we experimentally observe a DTQC in a driven-dissipative ensemble of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms, displaying non-equilibrium dynamical response with a different finite Abelian group symmetry $\mathbb{Z}{_m} \times \mathbb{Z}{_n}$. By applying a quasi-periodic drive using a dual-frequency drive with incommensurate frequencies, we demonstrate that the system exhibits a robust subharmonic response at multiple incommensurate frequencies, signifying the emergence of a DTQC phase. We map the full phase diagram of the system, which includes the DTQC phase, and demonstrated its rigidity against perturbations in both RF field intensity and laser detuning. Moreover, we observe a cyclic group symmetry effect that constrains the construction of $\mathbb{Z}{_2} \times \mathbb{Z}{_3}$-symmetric DTQC. This work establishes a versatile platform for studying non-equilibrium phases of matter and provides insights into the dynamics of time-translation symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems.

arXiv:2509.21285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalously slow coarsening in a dilute two-dimensional (2d) superfluid -- associated with a non-thermal fixed point in the closed system's universal dynamics and driven by three-vortex collisions which initiate vortex-pair annihilations -- is found to exhibit spatial scaling characteristics of Kraichnan-Kolmogorov turbulence. During a universal interval, when the characteristic length scale related to the inter-defect distance grows as $\ell_\text{v}\sim t^{\,\beta}$, with $\beta\approx1/5$, moments of the superfluid velocity circulation around an area of extent $r$ scale as predicted by classical turbulence theory, $\Gamma^{p}(r)\sim r^{4p/3}$. Intermittency corrections seen for higher values of $p$ are found to be consistent with values measured for fully developed, classical turbulence. Hence, we link the decaying quantum turbulence cascade in a closed superfluid to universal dynamics close to a non-thermal fixed point. The decay exponent $\beta$ clearly deviates from values known for classical systems.

arXiv:2509.21289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an approach to modeling ferrimagnets in MuMax3. We show that by specifying two interacting magnetic sublattices as separate layers, it is possible to reproduce a sperimagnetic-like ordering of magnetization. In such a system, magnetic and angular momentum compensation states can be achieved only by varying the temperature while keeping other parameters fixed. This behavior arises from the different temperature dependencies of the magnetization projections in the sublattices, as determined by their thermal functions. We also investigated the motion of a skyrmion under the action of a spin-polarized current. By changing the temperature, we observed both the disappearance of the skyrmion Hall effect at the angular compensation point and the maximum velocity of translational motion. The latter effect requires a modified version of MuMax3 that allows the g-factor to be specified for different regions. The proposed approach can also be applied to study other phenomena in ferrimagnets, including the influence of composition on the magnetic and angular compensation temperatures, the tilted phase, domain-wall motion, and effects arising from non-uniform current or temperature distributions.

Abstract: The study of topological properties in magnetic materials has long been one of the forefront research areas in condensed matter physics. CrSb, as a prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism, has attracted significant attention due to its unique magnetic properties. This system provides a novel platform for exploring the intrinsic relationship between altermagnetic order and exotic topological states. In this study, we combine systematic electrical transport experiments with first-principles calculations to investigate the possible realization mechanisms of topological semimetal states in CrSb and their manifestations in quantum transport phenomena. Our high field magneto-transport measurements reveal that the magnetoresistance of CrSb exhibits no sign of saturation up to 35 T, following a distinct power-law dependence with an exponent of 1.48. The nonlinear Hall resistivity further indicates a multiband charge transport mechanism. Under high magnetic fields, we observe pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations and discernible Zeeman-effect-induced band splitting at 1.6 K. Systematic Fermi surface and band calculations combined with Berry phase analysis confirm the nontrivial topological character of this material (with a Berry phase approaching {\pi}). These findings not only provide crucial experimental evidence for understanding the electronic structure of CrSb, but also establish an important foundation for investigating topological quantum states in altermagnets.

arXiv:2509.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-star random graph is the simplest exponential random graph model with nontrivial interactions between the graph edges. We propose a set of auxiliary variables that control the thermodynamic limit where the number of vertices N tends to infinity. Such 'master variables' are usually highly desirable in treatments of 'large N' statistical field theory problems. For the dense regime when a finite fraction of all possible edges are filled, this construction recovers the mean field solution of Park and Newman, but with an explicit control over the 1/N corrections. We use this advantage to compute the first subleading correction to the Park-Newman result, which encodes the finite, nonextensive contribution to the free energy. For the sparse regime with a finite mean degree, we obtain a very compact derivation of the Annibale-Courtney solution, originally developed with the use of functional integrals, which is comfortably bypassed in our treatment.

Abstract: Teaching and learning in advanced materials science are often limited by two barriers: the technical complexity of quantum-mechanical simulations and the lack of individualized support in inquiry-based education. Here, we introduce the Neuromorphic Materials Calculator 2025 (NMC2025), a command-line platform that integrates a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) tutor with automated simulation workflows. NMC2025 combines large language model (LLM) guidance, real-time literature feedback, and domain-specific computation to create an adaptive learning environment. The system includes modular Python components for material discovery, simulation parameter optimization, and automated input generation for Quantum ESPRESSO (QE). Grounded in constructivist pedagogy, the tool enables students to carry out authentic research tasks such as identifying candidate materials for neuromorphic memristors or tuning density functional theory (DFT) inputs, while receiving context-aware explanations from the AI tutor. A case study illustrates how iterative, AI-guided refinement of hypotheses and calculations enhances both accuracy and understanding. NMC2025 fosters deeper conceptual insight, independent exploration, and smooth transfer of research methods into the classroom. This approach highlights the potential of AI-augmented education to reduce barriers to complex simulations and to expand access to computational modeling across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

Guillermo Arias-Tamargo, Chris Hull, Maxwell L. Vel\'asquez Cotini Hutt

arXiv:2509.20441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the role of categorical symmetries in constraining the renormalisation of couplings in two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with Wess-Zumino term. A large class of these theories admit self-duality symmetries associated with discrete gauging and T-duality. They are generically non-conformal, but we argue that a particular coupling is protected from quantum corrections by the categorical symmetry. We give strong evidence for this claim by showing that the $\beta$-function for this coupling vanishes to 2-loop order if and only if this symmetry is present. Furthermore, in cases where the target space is a group manifold, the non-renormalisation result can be proven to hold non-perturbatively.

arXiv:2509.20494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address gauge invariance in the statistical mechanics of quantum many-body systems. The gauge transformation acts on the position and momentum degrees of freedom and it is represented by a quantum shifting superoperator that maps quantum observables onto each other. The shifting superoperator is anti-self-adjoint and it has noncommutative Lie algebra structure. These properties induce exact equilibrium sum rules that connect locally-resolved force and hyperforce densities for any given observable. We demonstrate the integration of the framework within quantum hyperdensity functional theory and show that it generalizes naturally to nonequilibrium.

arXiv:2509.20540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetry structure of a quantum field theory is determined not only by the topological defects that implement the symmetry and their fusion rules, but also by the topological networks they can form, which is referred to as the higher structure of the symmetry. In this paper, we consider theories with non-invertible symmetries that have an explicit Lagrangian description, and use it to study their higher structure. Starting with the 2d free compact boson theory and its non-invertible duality defects, we will find Lagrangian descriptions of networks of defects and use them to recover all the $F$-symbols of the familiar Tambara-Yamagami fusion category $\operatorname{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_N,+1)$. We will then use the same approach in 4d Maxwell theory to compute $F$-symbols associated with its non-invertible duality and triality defects, which are 2d topological field theories. In addition, we will also compute some of the $F$-symbols using a different (group theoretical) approach that is not based on the Lagrangian description, and find that they take the expected form.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED) at finite density on a quantum computer, including two fermion flavors. Our method employs an efficient gauge-invariant ansatz together with a quantum circuit structure that enforces Gauss's law. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our simulation protocol on a small lattice system, demonstrating the identification of phase transitions in terms of the particle number of the fermion flavors. Classical simulations are used to obtain optimized variational parameters, which are then deployed in inference runs on IBM quantum hardware. We conclude by discussing hardware limitations and prospects for scaling this method to larger systems.

arXiv:2509.20594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in pair plasma weakly nonlinear electromagnetic waves, $a_0 \leq 1$, experience Anderson self-localization. The beat between the driver and a back-scattered wave creates random, charge-neutral, large density fluctuations $\delta \rho/\rho \gg 1$, and corresponding random fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity $\epsilon$. Propagating in quasi-1D, waves in a medium with spatially random, time-varying, self-created fluctuations of dielectric permeability experience localization. Anderson self-localization of light leads to (i) reflection of EM waves by the under-dense pair plasma; (ii) a wave already present inside the plasma separates into bright trapped pockets and dark regions. Mild initial thermal spread restores wave propagation by suppressing the seeds of parametrically unstable density fluctuations. A circularly polarized driver produces linearly polarized structures, with position angle varying randomly between the bright pulses. We discuss possible applications to astrophysical Fast Radio Bursts.

Abstract: In the design of optical devices and components, geometric structures and optical properties of materials, such as absorption, refraction, reflection, diffraction, scattering, and trapping, have been utilized. Finding the ideal material with certain optical and geometric characteristics is essential for a customized application. Here, we fabricated unoxidizable achromatic copper films (ACFs) on Al2O3 substrates utilizing an atomic sputtering epitaxy apparatus. ACFs are made up of two regions vertically: a comparatively flat layer region and a three-dimensional (3D) porous nanostructured region on top of the flat region. The measured specular reflectance displayed low-pass filter behaviour with a sharp cutoff frequency in the infrared spectrum. Furthermore, the measured diffusive reflectance spectra showed light-trapping behaviour in the spectral region above the cutoff frequency, where there are no known absorption mechanisms, such as phonons and interband transitions. A focused ion beam scanning electron microscope was utilized to study the thin film's nanostructured region through 3D tomographic analysis in order to comprehend the phenomena that were observed. This work will shed fresh light on the design and optimization of optical filters and light-trapping employing porous nanostructured metallic thin films.

Abstract: Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a widely used high-throughput fabrication technique for photonic devices, yet its reliability is often compromised by the inevitable imperfections that arise during the demolding process. Topological photonics, which harnesses topologically nontrivial structures to support defect-robust photonic states, offers a promising solution to this challenge. Here, we demonstrate a topological laser that is one-step nanoimprinted upon colloidal perovskite nanocrystals. This laser features multiple higher-order topological corner states, with topological protection provided by the structure effectively mitigating imperfections caused by the nanoimprinting process. This property enables the reliable detection of these states, which is particularly challenging to achieve in the visible spectrum. Our work establishes topological photonics as a viable pathway to enhance the reliability of NIL-based manufacturing, providing a scalable and practical route for mass-producing topological lasers with low-index materials.

arXiv:2509.20922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos evidenced by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The locations of the classical and quantum crossover differ, reflecting the noncommutativity of the infinite-spin and infinite-time limits and the impact of entanglement, quantified via the entanglement entropy between subsystems.

Abstract: We investigate the equilibration time to attain steady-state for a system of liquid molecules under boundary-driven planar Couette flow via nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. In particular, we examine the equilibration time for the two common types of boundary driven flow: one in which both walls slide with equal and opposite velocity, and the other in which one wall is fixed and the other moves with twice the velocity. Both flows give identical steady-state strain rates, and hence flow properties, but the transient behaviour is completely different. We find that in the case of no-slip boundary conditions, the equilibration times for the counter-sliding walls flow are exactly 4 times faster than those of the single sliding wall system, and this is independent of the atomistic nature of the fluid, i.e., it is an entirely hydrodynamic feature. We also find that systems that exhibit slip have longer equilibration times in general and the ratio of equilibration times for the two types of boundary-driven flow is even more pronounced. We analyse the problem by decomposing a generic planar Couette flow into a linear sum of purely symmetric and antisymmetric flows. We find that the no-slip equilibration time is dominated by the slowest decaying eigenvalue of the solution to the Navier-Stokes equation. In the case of slip, the longest relaxation time is now dominated by the transient slip velocity response, which is longer than the no-slip response time. In the case of a high-slip system of water confined to graphene channels, the enhancement is over two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES) is a powerful technique for probing the unoccupied electronic states of materials. It can be regarded as the inversion process of photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), which examines the occupied states. Recently developed low-energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (LEIPS) can significantly advance the study of unoccupied states, owing to an improved signal-to-noise ratio and minimal sample damage compared to conventional IPES. However, the instrumental resolution remains at 0.2 eV, which is one order of magnitude lower than that of PES. Spectral broadening caused by the low instrumental resolution often results in overlapping peaks. Peak separation is therefore crucial in the analysis of LEIPS spectra. In this study, we compared three peak separation methods: second derivative, curve fitting, and deconvolution. These methods were applied to modeled and experimental LEIPS spectra of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital-derived band of pentacene, which consists of two splitting peaks due to the two inequivalent molecules in the unit cell. We systematically and quantitatively evaluated the performance of each method in terms of analysis parameters and discussed its robustness to noise as well as its peak separation capability. This work offers a practical framework for peak separation in LEIPS, with extensions to PES and a wide range of spectroscopies.

Abstract: We study novel conformal twist defects in 4d Maxwell theory, around which electric and magnetic fields are exchanged. These are codimension-2 defects living at the end of topological defects for certain non-invertible global symmetries. We determine the operator spectrum of the twist defect by solving classical electromagnetic wave equations subject to a twisted boundary condition. Using techniques from defect CFT, we show that correlation functions of these defect operators factorize into two sectors: a universal generalized free-field sector, and a chiral current sector analogous to edge modes in Chern-Simons theory. In a similar setup, we also revisit the twist fields attached to non-invertible line defects in the 2d compact boson CFT. We discuss a defect 't Hooft anomaly involving a chiral $O(2)$ symmetry, highlighting its dynamical implications.

Abstract: Judging by its omnipresence in the literature, the hysteresis observed in the transfer characteristics of emerging transistors based on 2D-materials is widely accepted as an important metric related to the device quality. The hysteresis is often reported with attributes like "negligible" or "small" without giving any specifics as to how this was determined and against what reference the measured values were compared to. Quite surprisingly, there appears to be only a fragmentary understanding of the mechanisms actually contributing to hysteresis and the sensitivity of the actual measurement on various experimental parameters. We attempt to close this gap by first providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the dominant mechanisms contributing to hysteresis: charge trapping by defects from the channel or the gate, the drift of mobile charges, and eventually ferroelectricity. We continue by suggesting methods to experimentally distinguishing between these phenomena. Based on these discussions it becomes clear that previously reported hysteresis values have little meaning as they have been non-systematically recorded under arbitrary conditions. In order to resolve this predicament, we propose a standardized hysteresis measurement scheme to establish the hysteresis as a comparable metric for the assessment of device stability. Our standardized scheme ensures that hysteresis data can be effectively compared across different technologies and, most importantly, provide a means to extrapolate data obtained on thicker prototypes to subnanometer equivalent oxide thicknesses. This facilitates the systematic benchmarking of insulator/channel combinations in terms of stability, which thereby enables the screening of material systems for more stable and reliable 2D-material-based MOSFETs.

Abstract: Majorana zero modes are predicted in several solid state systems such as hybrid superconductor-semiconductor structures and topological insulators coupled to superconductors. One of the expected signatures of Majorana modes is the fractional 4$\pi$ Josephson effect. Evidence in favor of this effect often comes from a.c. Josephson effect measurements and focuses on the observation of missing first or higher odd-numbered Shapiro steps. However, the disappearance of the odd Shapiro steps has also been reported in conventional Josephson junctions where no Majorana modes are expected. In this paper, we present a phenomenological model that displays suppression of the odd Shapiro steps. We perform resistively-shunted junction model calculations and introduce peaks in differential resistance as function of the bias current. In the presence of only the standard 2$\pi$ Josephson current, for chosen values of peak positions and amplitudes, we can suppress the odd Shapiro steps, or any steps, thus providing a possible explanation for the observation of missing Shapiro steps.

This FB mainly originates from the dz2-like orbitals of Pd atoms in the Pd kagome lattice, which has a finite interlayer electron hopping perpendicular to the PdS4 square plane. The interlayer hopping can be reinforced with the Se doping, inducing a stronger interlayer coupling via the chalcogen atoms at apical sites, which reduces the bandgap and enhances the cleavage energy. In contrast, the vanishing interlayer hopping in the two-dimensional limit results in the formation of ultra-FB in the monolayers of these compounds. The easy exfoliation and the existence of unique ultra-FB near EF make Pd3P2(S1-xSex)8 a model system to explore the exotic physics of FB in two-dimensional kagome lattice.

Abstract: It is argued that there are a set of orthonormal basis states, which appear as highly degenerate ground states arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking with a type-B Goldstone mode, and they are scale-invariant, with a salient feature that the entanglement entropy $S(n)$ scales logarithmically with the block size $n$ in the thermodynamic limit. As it turns out, the prefactor is half the number of type-B Goldstone modes $N_B$. This is achieved by performing an exact Schmidt decomposition of the orthonormal basis states, thus unveiling their self-similarities in the real space--the essence of a fractal. Combining with a field-theoretic prediction [O. A. Castro-Alvaredo and B. Doyon, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 120401 (2012)], we are led to the identification of the fractal dimension $d_f$ with the number of type-B Goldstone modes $N_B$ for the orthonormal basis states in quantum many-body systems undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Abstract: We numerically study shear-induced diffusion of soft athermal particles in two dimensions. The Green-Kubo (GK) formula is applicable to the shear-induced diffusion coefficient, where both mean squared transverse velocity and relaxation time included in the GK formula are well described by critical scaling near jamming. We show that the auto-correlation function of transverse velocities is stretched exponential if the system is below jamming or shear rate is large enough. However, if the system is above jamming and the shear rate is sufficiently small, the auto-correlation function exhibits a long-time tail such that time integral in the GK formula diverges in two dimensions. We propose an empirical scaling relation for the critical exponents and show that the long-time tail is consistent with the divergence of the shear-induced diffusion coefficient.

Abstract: We investigate the effect of easy-axis metamagnetic crossover on superconductivity in UTe$_2$ along the $a$-axis through measurements of AC susceptibility, magnetization, and the magnetocaloric effect. In ultra-clean single crystals, we identify a field-induced phase transition within the superconducting state at 5.6 T, driven by metamagnetism. This transition leads to a high-field superconducting state, significantly increasing the upper critical field to 12 T. A sudden increase in entropy at the transition suggests a self-reconstruction of the order parameter, enabling multi-component superconducting states to adapt to external perturbations.

Abstract: Ferromagnetic ground states have often been overlooked in comparison to seemingly more interesting antiferromagnetic ground states. However, both the physical and mathematical structure of ferromagnetic ground states are particularly rich. We show that the highly degenerate and highly entangled ground states of the ferromagnetic spin-1 biquadratic model are scale invariant, originating from spontaneous symmetry breaking from ${\rm SU}(3)$ to ${\rm U}(1)\times {\rm U}(1)$ with two type-B Goldstone modes if the system size is even or from ${\rm SU}(2)$ to ${\rm U}(1)$ with one type-B Goldstone mode if the system size is odd, when periodic boundary conditions are adopted. The ground state degeneracies are characterized as Fibonacci-Lucas sequences, under open and periodic boundary conditions, with nonzero residual entropy per site. This implies that the ground state degeneracies for this model are asymptotically the golden spiral. In addition, sequences of atypical (periodic) degenerate ground states generated from highest and generalized highest weight states are constructed to establish that the entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with the block size in the thermodynamic limit. The prefactor is half the number of type-B Goldstone modes, which is identified to be the fractal dimension, if one is restricted to atypical degenerate ground states. We also argue that the same conclusion is valid for typical (non-periodic) degenerate ground states, as long as the block size is sufficiently large.

Abstract: There is evidence that taking the time average of the work performed by a thermally isolated system effectively "transforms" the adiabatic process into an isothermal one. This approach allows inherent quantities of adiabatic processes to be accessed through the definitions of isothermal processes. A fluctuation theorem is then established, linking the time-averaged work to the quasistatic work. Numerical evidence supporting this equality is provided for a classical harmonic oscillator with a driven linear equilibrium position parameter. Furthermore, the strong inequality for the averaged work is derived from the deduced fluctuation theorem using optimality arguments.

Abstract: As a pinning-controlled permanent magnet, tailoring the cellular nanostructure of samarium-cobalt-based 1:7-type (SmCo-1:7) magnets remains crucial for improving magnetic performance. Jointing forward and inverse machine learning models with the high-throughput micromagnetic simulations (42,300 runs), we identify the nanostructural and magnetic features that are most effective for coercivity, combining both nucleation and pinning mechanisms. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the 1:5-phase enhances coercivity by providing high anisotropy, and the Z-phase strengthens pinning through fluctuations in domain wall energy. Cu additions in the 1:5-phase significantly reduce coercivity, while Fe substitutions in the 2:17-phase modestly reduce coercivity but improve pinning locally and increase saturation magnetization. Among all examined features, magnetocrystalline misorientation emerges as the dominant factor. Finally, the framework enables the inverse design of nanostructures with prescribed coercivity, demonstrating a computationally cost-effective toolkit for guiding the performance tailoring of SmCo-1:7 magnets.

Abstract: It is generally believed that electronic correlation, geometric frustration, and topology, \textit{individually}, can facilitate the emergence of various intriguing properties that have attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. Here, we report a series of unconventional Hall effects observed in a \textit{single} compound - quasi-kagome Kondo Weyl semimetal candidate Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$. In the paramagnetic phase, signature of dynamic $c$-$f$ hybridization is revealed by a reduction of anomalous Hall effect and is connected to frustration-promoted incoherent Kondo scattering. A large topological Hall effect exceeding 0.2 $\mu\Omega\cdot$cm is found at low temperatures, which should be ascribed to the non-collinear magnetic texture. In addition, a peculiar loop-shaped Hall effect with switching chirality is also seen, which is inferred to be associated with magnetic domain walls that pin history-dependent spin chirality and / or Fermi-arc surface states projected from the in-gap Weyl nodes. These exotic results place Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$ in a regime of highly-frustrated antiferromagnetic dense Kondo lattice with a nontrivial topology on an ``extended" global phase diagram, and highlight the interplay among electronic correlation, geometric frustration and topology.

Abstract: Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is a defining property of non-equilibrium systems, such as active matter, which is composed of units that consume energy. We employ a formalism that allows us to derive a class of identities associated with the time-reversal transformation in non-equilibrium field theories, in the spirit of Ward-Takahashi identities. We present a generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for active systems as a particular realization of such an identity, and consider its implications and applications for a range of active field theories. The field theoretical toolbox developed here helps to quantify the degree of non-equilibrium activity of complex systems exhibiting collective behavior.

Abstract: The discovery of magnetic materials with high operating temperature ranges and optimized performance is essential for advanced applications. Current data-driven approaches are limited by the lack of accurate, comprehensive, and feature-rich databases. This study aims to address this challenge by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a comprehensive, experiment-based, magnetic materials database named the Northeast Materials Database (NEMAD), which consists of 67,573 magnetic materials entries(www.nemad.org). The database incorporates chemical composition, magnetic phase transition temperatures, structural details, and magnetic properties. Enabled by NEMAD, we trained machine learning models to classify materials and predict transition temperatures. Our classification model achieved an accuracy of 90% in categorizing materials as ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and non-magnetic (NM). The regression models predict Curie (N\'eel) temperature with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.87 (0.83) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 56K (38K). These models identified 25 (13) FM (AFM) candidates with a predicted Curie (N\'eel) temperature above 500K (100K) from the Materials Project. This work shows the feasibility of combining LLMs for automated data extraction and machine learning models to accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials.

Arnout Beckers (imec, Leuven, Belgium)

arXiv:2410.09276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully conductive band tails cause the subthreshold swing to saturate at temperatures above 1 K. However, recent measurements indicate that below 1 K, the subthreshold swing in certain MOSFET structures resumes a linear scaling with temperature. Following this ultra-steep behavior, a new type of plateau has been measured below 1 K. In this letter, we show that hybrid band tails, with both traps and mobile states, explain this new plateau. Furthermore, hybrid band tails explain various non-saturating behaviors above 1 K. Remarkably, for entirely non-conductive band tails, the simulations and theory predict a third type of plateau below 10 mK. We hypothesize that this represents the lower bound of subthreshold swing at sub-Kelvin temperatures, which is a testable prediction from the theory.

Abstract: We introduce a class of interacting fermionic quantum models in $d$ dimensions with nodal interactions that exhibit superdiffusive transport. We establish non-perturbatively that the nodal structure of the interactions gives rise to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that result in a diverging diffusion constant, even though the system is fully chaotic. Using a Boltzmann equation approach, we find that the charge mode acquires an anomalous dispersion relation at long wavelength $\omega(q) \sim q^{z} $ with dynamical exponent $z={\rm min}[(2n+d)/2n,2]$, where $n$ is the order of the nodal point in momentum space. We verify our predictions in one dimensional systems using tensor-network techniques.

Abstract: Quantum matter phases may co-exist microscopically even when they display competing tendencies. A fundamental question is whether such a competition can be avoided through the elimination of one phase while the other one condenses into the ground state. Here, we present a high-resolution neutron spectroscopy study of the low-energy spin excitations in the high-temperature superconductor La1.855Sr0.145CuO4. In the normal state, we find low-energy magnetic fluctuations at incommensurate reciprocal lattice positions where spin-density-wave order emerges at lower Sr concentration or at high magnetic fields. While these spin excitations are largely suppressed by the emergence of the superconducting spin gap, some low-energy magnetic fluctuations persist deep inside the superconducting state. We interpret this result in terms of a dynamic competition between superconductivity and magnetism, where superconductivity impedes the condensation of low-energy magnetic fluctuations through the formation of magnetically-mediated Cooper pairs.

Abstract: Nodal noncentrosymmetric superconductors can host zero-energy flat bands of Majorana surface states within the projection of the nodal lines onto the surface Brillouin zone. Thus, these systems can have stationary, localized Majorana wave packets on certain surfaces, which may be a promising platform for quantum computation. Such applications require protocols to manipulate the wave packets in order to move them without destroying their localization or coherence. As a step in this direction, we explore the idea that the surface states have a nontrivial spin polarization, which can couple for example to the magnetization of a ferromagnetic insulator in contact to the surface, via an exchange term in the Hamiltonian. Such a coupling can make the previously flat bands weakly dispersive. We aim to model the motion of spatially localized wave packets under the influence of an exchange field which is changed adiabatically. We calculate the time-evolved wave packet for a model system and discuss which factors influence the direction of motion and the broadening of the wave packet.

Abstract: We introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopically large bath. The algorithm is few-body revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation. Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.

Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials that are promising for spintronics technology. Here it is shown that in altermagnets, the circular dichroism (CD) in resonant photoelectron diffraction (RPED) contains a time-reversal odd signal, which provides a direct probe of the sublattice magnetization. RPED calculations are performed for MnTe at the Mn L$_{2,3}$-edge resonance, using a combination of atomic multiplet and multiple scattering theory. A large magnetic CD is found for light helicity parallel to the N\'eel vector. This signal has the same angular distribution as the difference between the structural RPED of the two magnetic sublattices and its amplitude is approximately proportional to the X-ray magnetic CD in absorption of a single sublattice, thus providing a direct probe of the local magnetic moments.

Abstract: Light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM)--known as vortex beams--has broadened the scope of understanding and applications of light's angular momentum. Optical tweezers using OAM, often referred to as optical spanners, have significantly expanded the tunability of optical manipulation. A key frontier now lies in understanding how vortex beams interact with quantum states of matter. In this work, we numerically investigate the dynamics of a superconductor under vortex beam illumination and demonstrate the transfer of angular momentum from light to the superconducting collective mode, resulting in mechanical rotation. Our findings open a pathway for optical manipulation in the quantum regime, which we term the quantum optical spanner.

Abstract: Half-Heusler compounds are a class of materials with great potential for the study of distinct electronic states. In this work, we investigate, from first-principles, the possibility of hinge modes in closely related topological phases that are tunable by moderate uni-axial strain. We consider two compounds: LiSbZn and LiBiZn. While LiSbZn has a topologically trivial band structure, the larger spin-orbit coupling of Bi causes a band inversion in LiBiZn. We predict the existence of topologically trivial hinge states in both cases. The hinge modes are affected by both the crystal termination, and the bulk topological phase transitions, albeit indirectly: When present, topological surface modes hybridize with the hinge states and obscure their visibility. Thus, we find that the most visible hinge modes occur when no band inversions are present in the material. Our work highlights the interplay and competition between surface and hinge modes in half-Heuslers, and may help guide the experimental search for robust boundary signatures in these materials.

Abstract: The visualization of the magnetic responses of a two-dimensional (2D) superconducting material on the nanoscale is a powerful approach to unravel the underlying supercurrent behavior and to investigate critical phenomena in reduced dimensions. In this study, scanning quantum microscopy is utilized to explore the local magnetic response of the 2D superconductor 2H-NbSe2. Our technique enables both static and dynamic sensing of superconducting vortices with high sensitivity and a spatial resolution down to 30 nm, unveiling unexpected phenomena linked to the intrinsic 2D nature of the superconductor, which are challenging to detect with more conventional local probes. Vortices do not arrange in a hexagonal lattice, but form a distorted vortex glass with expanding vortex size. A vortex can exhibit strong local dynamics due to thermal excitation. As the critical temperature is approached, a clear melting of the vortex glass is identified, leading to distinct configurations under different cooling conditions. Vortex fluctuations can also be probed through spin Hahn-echo measurements, which reveal the spin decoherence even well below the critical temperature -- and, intriguingly, enhanced decoherence at lower temperatures. Spatiotemporal microscopy of the magnetic dynamics associated with vortex excitations and fluctuations provides direct evidence of 2D superconducting phenomena at the nanoscale.

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), a hallmark of non-Hermitian systems, stems from the topological nature of complex energy spectra, typically characterized by a non-zero spectral winding number. Beyond the spinless frameworks considered so far, here we realize a generic, tunable spinful NHSE in a 1D tight-binding lattice endowed with spin-dependent Abelian gauge fields. With proper tuning of the gauge parameter, we uncover an emergence of bidirected, spin-polarized zero-winding skin states, appearing in the absence of transpose-type time-reversal symmetry (T RS{\dag}) and featuring scale-restricted localization with non-Bloch spectral stability. While clearly distinct from the known Z2 and Critical NHSEs, these unconventional skin states evolve into them upon enforcing TRS{\dag} and introducing inter-spin coupling via magnetic fields, respectively. The magnetic field further drives a transition from a bidirectional to a unidirectional skin configuration. Our work unifies the previously known zero-winding NHSEs within a broader framework and provides experimentally accessible routes for realization in photonic and ultracold atomic systems with synthetic gauge fields.

Abstract: Self-propelled particles, like motile cells and artificial colloids, can spontaneously form macroscopic clusters. This phenomenon is called motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) and occurs even without attractive forces, provided that the self-propulsion direction fluctuates slowly. In addition to rotational noise, these particles may experience translational noise, not coupled to rotational noise, due to environmental fluctuations. We study the role of translational noise in the clustering of active Brownian hard disks. To tease apart the contribution of translational noise, we model excluded-volume interactions through a Monte-Carlo-like overlap rejection approach. We find that increasing translational diffusivity has a non-monotonic effect on clustering. At low values, it makes clusters more compact and rounded (less filamentous), eventually promoting genuine MIPS. For sufficiently higher translational diffusivity, clusters evaporate. We develop a theory for the cluster mass distribution, and employ a hydrodynamic approach with parameters taken from the simulation, that explains the clustering phase diagram.

Abstract: In this review, we present recent works on materials whose common point is the presence of electronic bands of very low dispersion, called "flat bands", which are due to specific atomic order effects without electron interactions. These states are always indicative of some form of confinement and have consequences on the electronic properties. A first part is devoted to the cases where this confinement is due to the long-range geometry of the defect-free structure. We have thus studied periodic approximant structures of quasiperiodic Penrose and octagonal tilings, and twisted bilayers of graphene (TBG) or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) whose rotation angle between the two layers assumes a special value, called "magic angle". In these materials, the flat bands correspond to electronic states distributed over a very large number of atoms (several hundreds or even thousands of atoms). We have shown that their electronic transport properties cannot be described by usual Bloch-Boltzmann theories, because the interband terms of the velocity operator dominate the intraband terms as far as quantum diffusion is concerned. In the case of TBG, flat bands can induce a magnetic state and other electron-electron correlation effects. The second part focuses on two-dimensional nanomaterials in the presence of local point defects that cause resonant electronic states (vacancies, adsorbed atoms or molecules). We present studies on monolayer graphene, twisted or Bernal bilayer graphene, carbon nanotubes, monolayer and multilayer black phosphorene, and monolayer TMDs. A recent result is the discovery that the selective functionalization of a Bernal bilayer graphene sublattice leads to a metallic or insulating behavior depending on the functionalized sublattice type. This result suggests that functionalization can be a key parameter to control the electronic properties of 2D materials.

Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region, e.g., InAs on a (001)-oriented GaAs substrate, can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.

Abstract: Quantum gases of ultracold polar molecules have novel properties because of the strong dipolar forces between molecules. Current experiments shield the molecules from destructive collisions by engineering long-range repulsive interactions using microwave or static electric fields. These shielding methods produce interaction potentials with large repulsive cores that are not well described with contact potentials. In this paper we explore the anisotropic interaction potentials that arise for pairs of polar molecules shielded with static electric fields. We derive computationally inexpensive approximations for the potentials that are suitable for use in calculations of many-body properties. The interaction potentials for molecules shielded with static fields are substantially different from those that arise from microwave shielding and will produce quite different many-body physics.

Abstract: The electronic structure of the lightly hole-doped triangular-lattice moir\'e Hubbard model is studied within cluster perturbation theory (CPT) using 13-site clusters for a fixed doping concentration $p=1/13$ varying the Coulomb parameter $U$ and the hopping phase parameter $\phi$ related to the spin-orbital interaction. We have also developed a rather simple generalized mean-field approximation (GMFA) containing the amplitude of the spin correlations as a free parameter to fit the CPT data.The evolution of the Fermi surface and the pseudogap with the parameters $\phi$ and $U$ is explained from the viewpoint of the short-range magnetic order. The geometric frustration and the additional model parameter related to the spin-orbital interaction result in a more rich physics of the pseudogap state compared to the case of a more conventional square lattice.

This Haldane state, arising from underscreening of the $S=3/2$ chain, is stable against small $D$ and characterized by topological edge modes. The nature of the $D$-driven transitions out of this state depends on the environment. Coupling to a metal (semi-metal) is a relevant (irrelevant) perturbation at the decoupled fixed point between the spin-1 chain and the two-dimensional electron gas. In the large positive $D$ limit, the system maps onto an anisotropic spin-$1/2$ Kondo system. For large negative $D$, in the Ising phase, spins are frozen. For small $J_k$, the nature of the metallic phase dominates. On a two-dimensional semi-metal, the Kondo coupling is irrelevant at the decoupled fixed point ($J_k= 0$), leading to a Kondo breakdown phase at weak coupling, irrespective of $D$. In contrast, on a two-dimensional metal, the resulting dissipative Ohmic bath is a marginally relevant perturbation, inducing antiferromagnetic ordering along the chain. In this case, $D$ drives a spin-flop transition between Ising and XY ordered phases. At $D=0$, we observe continuous transitions between the Kondo breakdown or dissipation-induced long-range ordered phases and the underscreened Haldane phase. These phase diagrams are supported by scaling arguments and sign-free auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract: We extend the stochastic GW (sGW) formalism to fully spin-polarized systems, encompassing both collinear and non-collinear spin configurations. For non-collinear systems-where Kohn-Sham states are complex two-component spinors-we develop a complex-valued stochastic basis that preserves the real-valued external stochastic charge applied at time zero. This basis enables an unbiased evaluation of the random-phase approximation (RPA) screened interaction for spinors. Through error analysis and tests on real materials, we show that the performance of collinear sGW retains the same time complexity as the spin-unpolarized sGW . The non-collinear sGW incurs a computational cost two to three times higher than the spin-unpolarized version, while preserving linear scaling with low multiplicity. By unifying collinear and non-collinear treatments within a single scalable framework, our work paves the way for routine many-body predictions in large scale magnetic and spin-orbit-coupled material systems.

Abstract: The synthesis of crystalline materials, such as zeolites, remains a significant challenge due to a high-dimensional synthesis space, intricate structure-synthesis relationships and time-consuming experiments. Considering the one-to-many relationship between structure and synthesis, we propose DiffSyn, a generative diffusion model trained on over 23,000 synthesis recipes spanning 50 years of literature. DiffSyn generates probable synthesis routes conditioned on a desired zeolite structure and an organic template. DiffSyn achieves state-of-the-art performance by capturing the multi-modal nature of structure-synthesis relationships. We apply DiffSyn to differentiate among competing phases and generate optimal synthesis routes. As a proof of concept, we synthesize a UFI material using DiffSyn-generated synthesis routes. These routes, rationalized by density functional theory binding energies, resulted in the successful synthesis of a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ of 19.0, which is expected to improve thermal stability and is higher than that of any previously recorded.

Abstract: Studying critical states in quasiperiodic systems is of great importance in localization physics. Previously identified critical states share a common characteristic: they exhibit persistent critical features in the thermodynamic limit. In this Letter, we predict an exotic type of critical state, termed size-dependent critical states, which exhibit a fundamentally distinct behavior. Specifically, they display critical localization signatures only at finite sizes, but transition to Anderson localization in the thermodynamic limit. We establish that the physical origin of size-dependent critical states lies in the synergistic interplay between local non-reciprocal domain wall and NHSE. By revealing a critical phase that challenges the established paradigm of critical localization, our work opens new avenues for exploring localization phenomena in quasiperiodic systems.

Abstract: A long-standing problem has been a theoretical prediction of the densest packing fraction of random packings, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of same-size discs in $d=2$ and spheres in $3$. However, to minimize order, experiments and numerical simulations often use two-size discs. For practical purposes, then, a predictive theory for the packing fraction, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of the densest such bidisperse packings is more useful. A disorder-guaranteeing theory is formulated here to fill this gap, using an approach that led to an exact solution for monodisperse discs in $d=2$ [1]. $\Phi_{RCP}$ depends on the sizes ratio, $D$, and concentrations, $p$, of the disc types and the developed theory enables derivation of exact and rigorous upper and lower bounds on $\Phi_{RCP}(p,D)$, as well as an explicit prediction of it.

Abstract: We report on an experimental investigation of the interplay between friction, contact geometry and finite strains for smooth frictional contacts between rigid spherical glass probes and flat silicone substrates. Using both bulk and layered substrates under various loading conditions (normal force, radius of the probe), we show that shear-induced anisotropic shrinkage of the adhesive contact area under steady-state sliding is an effect of finite-elasticity conditions and is drastically affected by the level of geometric confinement. The resulting non-linear coupling between the normal and lateral directions is also investigated by measuring the changes in the indentation depth (conv. normal load) during the stiction of the adhesive contacts under imposed normal load (conv. indentation depth) conditions, with strong effects of contact confinement. From a comparison with adhesiveless linear contact mechanics calculations, we show that the experimental observations can only be accounted for by the occurrence of finite strains/displacements conditions. Accordingly, measurements of the in-plane surface displacements at the surface of the rubber substrates confirm that strain levels well in the neo-Hookean range are experienced during steady-state frictional sliding.

Abstract: The one-dimensional spin-$s$ ${\rm SU}(2)$ ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, as a paradigmatic example for spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) with type-B Goldstone modes (GMs), is expected to exhibit an abstract fractal underlying the ground state subspace. This intrinsic abstract fractal is here revealed from a systematic investigation into the entanglement entropy for a linear combination of factorized (unentangled) ground states on a fractal decomposable into a set of the Cantor sets. The entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with the block size, with the prefactor being half the fractal dimension of a fractal, as long as the norm for the linear combination scales as the square root of the number of the self-similar building blocks kept at each step $k$ for a fractal, under an assumption that the maximum absolute value of the coefficients in the linear combination is chosen to be around one, and the coefficients in the linear combination are almost constants within the building blocks. Actually, the set of the fractal dimensions for all the Cantor sets forms a {\it dense} subset in the interval $[0,1]$. As a consequence, the ground state subspace is separated into a disjoint union of countably infinitely many regions, each of which is labeled by a decomposable fractal. Hence, the interpretation of the prefactor as half the fractal dimension is valid for any support beyond a fractal, which in turn leads to the identification of the fractal dimension with the number of type-B GMs for the orthonormal basis states. Our argument may be extended to any quantum many-body systems undergoing SSB with type-B GMs.

Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.

Abstract: Fokker-Planck equations (forward Kolmogorov equations) evolve probability densities in time from an initial condition. For distributions over the real line, these evolution equations can sometimes be transformed into dynamics over the incomplete zeroth and first moments. We call this perspective the Lorenz dynamics of the system after the Lorenz curve description of distributions of wealth. This offers the benefit of presenting the dynamics over a compact domain. The integral transformation is motivated and then stated for a general class of Fokker-Planck equations. Following this, the transformed equation is solved for the heat equation and some variants thereof. Finally, some equations arising from the application of kinetic theory to idealized economic systems are transformed and analyzed in this new light.

arXiv:2501.13459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we explore how symmetry is dynamically broken through the lens of entanglement asymmetry in two distinct scenarios: a non-symmetric random quantum circuit and a non-symmetric Hamiltonian quench, with a particular focus on U(1) symmetry. In the former case, the symmetry is initially broken and subsequently restored, whereas in the latter case, symmetry remains broken in the subsystem at late times, consistent with the principles of quantum thermalization. Notably, the growth of entanglement asymmetry exhibits unexpected overshooting behavior at early times in both contexts, contrasting with the behavior of charge variance. We also consider dynamics of non-symmetric initial states under the symmetry-breaking evolution. Due to the competition of symmetry-breaking in both the initial state and Hamiltonian, the early-time entanglement asymmetry can increase and decrease, while quantum Mpemba effects remain evident despite the weak symmetry-breaking in both settings.

Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model does not require post-selection and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.

Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional free fermion model with nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping, evolving in imaginary time from a product state with N consecutive fermions, and conditioned to go back to the same state after a given time. Such types of models are quantum reformulations of well-studied two-dimensional classical lattice models, which are known to give rise to limit shapes where expectation values of simple local observables, such as density, depend on position in an appropriate scaling limit. In the case of only nearest neighbor hopping, this model is known to have two fluctuating regions which can be tuned to merge depending on ratio between time and N. Correlations near the merger are governed by a so-called tacnode kernel. Here we show that another universal higher-order tacnode process can appear upon including the next-nearest neighbor term. We also discuss the limit shapes, and compute analytically the corresponding density profile.

Abstract: We study a near-field thermophotonic (NF-TPX) refrigerating device, consisting of a lightemitting diode and a photovoltaic cell in close proximity. Calculations are performed in the frame of the detailed-balance approach. We study how thermal radiation, separation distance and LED temperature can affect both cooling power and coefficient of performance. More specifically, we assess the impact of bandgap energy and external quantum efficiency for an artificial material on those cooling performances. For a particular device made of GaAs and/or AlGaAs we show that, in the near-field regime, the cooling power can be increased by one order of magnitude compared to far field. However, a 10% reduction of the external quantum efficiency can lead to a decrease of the cooling power by two orders of magnitude. Finally, we compare existing literature data on electroluminescent, TPX and thermoelectric cooling with our detailed balance prediction, which highlights design-rule requirements for NF-TPX cooling devices.

arXiv:2506.21058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a method of analyzing the joint probability density (JPD) ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ of an eigenvalue $z$ and the associated right eigenvector ${\bf v}$ (normalized with ${\bf v}^*{\bf v}=1$) for non-Hermitian random matrices of a given size $N\times N$. The approach is essentially based on the Kac-Rice counting formula applied to the associated characteristic polynomial combined with a certain integral identity for the Dirac delta function of such a polynomial. To illustrate utility of the general method we derive ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ in the two particular cases: (i) one-parameter family of matrices interpolating between complex Ginibre and real Ginibre ensembles and (ii) a complex Ginibre matrix additively perturbed by a general fixed matrix. In particular, in the former case we analyze the formation of an excess of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the real axis on approaching the real Ginibre limit, which eventually gives rise to the existence of a new scaling regime of "weak non-reality" as $N\to \infty$. In the second case we further analyze non-Hermitian Rosenzweig-Porter model which recently attracted considerable interest in physics literature. In addition, we provide new insights into eigenvalue and eigenvector distribution for a general rank one perturbation of complex Ginibre matrices of finite size $N$, and in the structure of an outlier emerging as $N\gg 1$. Finally we discuss a generalization of the proposed method which is expected to be suitable for analysis of JPD involving both left- and right eigenvectors.

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures. We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30% relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000 entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials discovery.

Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.
