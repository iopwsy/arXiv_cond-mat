Abstract: Toroidal sigma models of magneto-transport are analyzed, in which integer and fractional quantum Hall effects automatically are unified by a {holomorphic modular symmetry}. By exploiting a quantum equivalence called \emph{mirror symmetry}, these models are mapped to tractable mirror models (also elliptic), in which topological protection is provided by more familiar winding numbers. Phase diagrams and scaling properties of elliptic models are compared to some of the experimental and numerical data accumulated over the past three decades. The geometry of scaling flows extracted from quantum Hall experiments is in good agreement with modular predictions, including the location of many quantum critical points. One conspicuous model %(arguably the simplest and most natural one) has a critical delocalization exponent $\nu_{\rm tor} = 18 \ln 2 /(\pi^2 G^4) = 2.6051\dots$ ($G$ is Gauss' constant) that is in excellent agreement with the value $\nu_{\rm num} = 2.607\pm\,.004$ calculated in the numerical Chalker-Coddington model, suggesting that these models are in the same universality class. The real delocalization exponent may be disentangled from other scaling exponents in finite size scaling experiments, giving an experimental value $\nu_{\rm exp} = 2.3\pm 0.2$. The modular model suggests how these theoretical and experimental results may be reconciled, but in order to determine if these theoretical models really are in the quantum Hall universality class, improved finite size scaling experiments are urgently needed.

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction is a long-standing challenge in materials science, with most data-driven methods developed for inorganic systems. This leaves an important gap for organic crystals, which are central to pharmaceuticals, polymers, and functional materials, but present unique challenges, such as larger unit cells and strict chemical connectivity. We introduce a flow-matching model for predicting organic crystal structures directly from molecular graphs. The architecture integrates molecular connectivity with periodic boundary conditions while preserving the symmetries of crystalline systems. A bond-aware loss guides the model toward realistic local chemistry by enforcing distributions of bond lengths and connectivity. To support reliable and efficient training, we built a curated dataset of organic crystals, along with a preprocessing pipeline that precomputes bonds and edges, substantially reducing computational overhead during both training and inference. Experiments show that our method achieves a Match Rate more than 10 times higher than existing baselines while requiring fewer sampling steps for inference. These results establish generative modeling as a practical and scalable framework for organic crystal structure prediction.

Abstract: The Casimir-Polder interaction energy between a unipolarizable point atom and a unipolarizable dielectric ring has been limited, until now, to the case when the atom is confined on the axis of symmetry of the ring. We find the generalized analytical expression for any position of the atom relative to the ring in terms of complete elliptic integrals. This is aided by the construction of a class of integrals of a Jacobian elliptic function as a linear combination of complete elliptic integrals. Our expression for the interaction energy allows us to investigate the instability of the atom even for the equilibrium points which exists off the axis of symmetry.

arXiv:2602.20236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent electrodynamics arising from spatially and temporally varying magnetic textures provides a framework for spin control in quantum materials. While this principle is established for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic textures, its consequences for altermagnets -- magnetic orders with vanishing net magnetization but finite spin splitting -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an effective low-energy theory of itinerant electrons coupled to smoothly varying altermagnetic spin textures. In the adiabatic regime, we show that altermagnetic textures generate additional emergent electromagnetic fields and quantum-geometric effects that are absent in conventional magnetic systems. These effects include emergent Zeeman fields that encode the structure of the altermagnetic order parameter, enabling local spin manipulation and a way to distinguish different altermagnetic orders. Moreover, we demonstrate a quantum-metric-induced, spin-dependent electron lensing effect that provides a mechanism for spin filtering, and discuss the local admixture of effective odd-parity magnetic components. Our results suggest that textured altermagnets could serve as a versatile resource for spintronics functionalities and a probe of altermagnetism.

arXiv:2602.20251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a hydrodynamic theory of charge and heat currents induced by traveling waves, such as surface acoustic waves, in graphene devices near charge neutrality. The currents depend on the intrinsic conductivity and viscosity of the electron liquid, the disorder strength, and the geometry of the device. We obtain analytic expressions for the heat and charge currents to second order in the wave amplitude for Hall-bar devices. At charge neutrality and in the absence of DC bias, the heat content is entrained by the wave in the absence of net charge transfer. At the same time, device conductance is enhanced by the wave. Away from charge neutrality, the transport charge current induced by the wave arises in the absence of a DC bias.

arXiv:2602.20256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic theory of spectral decimation for quantum many-body Hamiltonians and show that it provides a quantitative probe of emergent symmetries in statistically mixed spectra. Building on an analytical description of statistical mixtures, we derive an explicit expression for the size of a characteristic symmetry sector (CSS), defined as the largest subsequence of levels exhibiting non-Poissonian correlations. The CSS dimension is shown to be the size-biased average of the underlying symmetry sectors, establishing a direct link between spectral statistics and Hilbert-space structure. We apply this framework to two paradigmatic settings: Hilbert-space fragmentation and disorder-induced many-body localization (MBL). In fragmented systems, the CSS reproduces the mixture prediction and isolates correlated subsectors even when the full spectrum appears nearly Poissonian. In the disordered Heisenberg chain, spectral decimation reveals the gradual emergence of integrability through a shrinking CSS, whose statistics exhibit signatures consistent with local integrals of motion. We introduce a characteristic symmetry entropy (CSE) as a finite-size scaling observable and extract, within accessible system sizes, the crossover exponents. Our results establish spectral decimation as a controlled, unbiased and computationally inexpensive diagnostic of hidden structure in many-body spectra, capable of distinguishing between chaotic dynamics, statistical mixtures, and emergent integrability.

arXiv:2602.20259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general hydrodynamic theory for active fluids, capable of describing living matter, that conserve center of mass or dipole moment. Imposition of dipole or center-of-mass conservation has been reported to yield peculiar behavior: breaking Galilean invariance in classical systems and potentially enabling exotic immobile excitations in quantum settings. In passive fluids, dipole conservation has been shown to cause a breakdown of linear hydrodynamics in all experimentally relevant dimensions. We show that introducing activity changes this picture: it can either restore or break linear hydrodynamics depending on spatial dimensions. Using our formulation, we predict universal dynamical scaling exponents for single-component active fluids in $d=1,2,3$ dimensions and find agreement with microscopic lattice-field simulations. Strikingly, for $d\geq 2$, activity revives linear hydrodynamics, while for $d<2$ it leads to a breakdown; both cases flow to previously unexplored universality classes. Our results suggest that dipole-conserving active fluids are far more experimentally accessible than their passive counterparts.

Abstract: An applied magnetic field affects a superconductor in two ways -- by promoting pairing fluctuations, and by inducing topological defects called vortices that carry quantized magnetic flux. A quantitative characterization of the resultant field-induced superconducting dynamics with spatio-temporal resolution remains challenging, particularly in two-dimensional materials. In this work, we analyze magnetic noise measured by the depolarization rate of a proximate single spin-qubit as a non-invasive probe of such dynamical fluctuations. We demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the magnetic noise spectrum near $T_c$ deviates from predictions based on quasiparticle excitations due to critical superconducting fluctuations, which in turn are enhanced by a weak applied field. By analyzing the magnetic noise due to vortex dynamics, we further show that noise spectroscopy is not only able to distinguish between different vortex phases, but also extract key physical quantities of interest, such as oscillation frequencies of pinned vortices, phonon dispersion of vortex lattices and vortex diffusivity in a vortex liquid. Complementing recent work on noise magnetometry of quasiparticle excitations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in two-dimensional superconductors without an applied field, our work highlights the ability of noise spectroscopy to reveal a wealth of superconducting dynamical phenomena in an applied field.

arXiv:2602.20288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superconductivity and magnetism in bilayer nickelates from an itinerant perspective. Starting from a tight binding fit to recent ARPES measurements on compressively strained thin films, we incorporate the standard set of onsite repulsive interactions among partially filled $e_g$ orbitals: intra-orbital $U$, inter-orbital $U'$, Hund's coupling $J_H$ and a pair hopping $J_P$. We obtain the effective pairing interaction by dressing these bare interactions with particle-hole fluctuations via the RPA. In the strong Hund's coupling regime, we find that $s$-wave superconductivity and $(\pi/2, \pi/2)$ SDW order are the favored ground states. With weaker Hund's coupling, we find that $d$-wave pairing and $(\pi, \pi)$ SDW are the leading ground states. Our results are qualitatively consistent with earlier DMRG studies, and point to the key role played by Hund's coupling in determining the nature of superconductivity and magnetism in this system.

Rapha\"el Maire

arXiv:2602.20308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While nucleation in typical active and driven fluids often appears equilibrium-like, striking departures emerge when large-scale fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Here, we investigate nucleation in nonequilibrium hyperuniform fluids by projecting the full density-field dynamics onto relevant collective variables. We demonstrate that nucleation is governed by a nonequilibrium quasi-potential rather than the reversible work of formation. Surprisingly, because of the reduced hyperuniform fluctuations, the nucleation probability no longer separates into the usual surface and volume contributions. Furthermore, accounting for capillary waves reveals a clear breakdown of detailed balance driven by nonreciprocal dynamics. More broadly, our framework can be readily extended to identify nonequilibrium signatures in conventional active fluids.

arXiv:2602.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting how complex systems respond to external perturbations is a central challenge in nonequilibrium statistical physics. Here we consider continuous-time Markov networks, which we subject to perturbations along a single edge. We find that in steady state the probabilities of any two states are linearly related to one another. We show that this mutual linearity of probabilities extends to a broad class of observables, including currents but also generic counting and state-dependent observables. Moreover, we derive an exact relation between the relative response of any state's probability and the ratio of two steady-state probabilities. Leveraging the Markov chain tree theorem, we further show that probabilities and the considered observables are constrained by the topological and kinetic properties of the network and provide analytical expressions in terms of spanning tree polynomials. Our results are general, holding for arbitrary rate parameterizations and extending far from equilibrium.

arXiv:2602.20322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An atomic Josephson junction realized with dipolar bosons in a double-well potential can be described by an extended Bose-Hubbard model in which dipolar interactions generate an effective on-site interaction and nearest-neighbor pair tunneling. Using mean-field theory and exact diagonalization, we investigate how this correlated process affects zero-temperature equilibrium and dynamical properties of the system. In equilibrium, we show that pair tunneling induces ground-state parity modulations and significantly reshapes the phase diagram, producing qualitative changes in the quantum phase transitions toward NOON and phase-NOON states, as well as quantitative shifts of the critical points. Out of equilibrium, we demonstrate that it modifies the conditions for macroscopic quantum self-trapping, and assess its impact by comparing mean-field and fully quantum evolution, including the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions.

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is a fundamental building block for dissipationless nonreciprocal electronics, yet its microscopic origins in thin films often involve competing mechanisms that remain debated. Here, we demonstrate that the SDE can be engineered in niobium films by patterning macroscopic asymmetric antidots, revealing distinct control mechanisms under in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We identify two dominant contributions to nonreciprocal transport: edge flux pinning, which governs the low-field and in-plane field regimes via surface-barrier asymmetry, and bulk flux pinning, which drives the high-field response and correlates directly with the geometric asymmetry of the antidots. Supported by time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations and an analytical model, we provide a unified description of these regimes, linking the diode efficiency to the specific pinning landscape. These findings establish a flexible design principle for engineering superconducting diodes with tunable functionality, paving the way for their integration into next-generation quantum and cryogenic circuits.

Abstract: We report the demonstration of high-performance top-gated metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) based on the ultra-wide bandgap perovskite oxide SrSnO$_3$ (SSO). Using hybrid molecular beam epitaxy-grown SSO channels and ALD-deposited HfO$_2$ gate dielectrics, the devices exhibit field-effect mobility exceeding 65 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s, an on-state current up to 194 mA/mm, an on/off current ratio above $10^8$, and a contact resistance of 0.66 $\Omega\cdot$mm. The devices also show a near-ideal subthreshold slope of 68 mV/dec and negligible hysteresis, indicating a high-quality dielectric/semiconductor interface. These results establish SrSnO$_3$ as a promising ultra-wide bandgap oxide semiconductor platform for high-performance power electronic applications.

Abstract: Plastic waste, being one of the most important problems for humankind, poses severe threats to ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. Tracing, quantifying, and identifying types of plastic waste is of crucial importance to understand its environmental pathways and develop targeted strategies for reduction, recycling, and remediation. To contribute to addressing this global issue, we investigated the spin-labeling capabilities of aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO$_2$) radicals upon introduction into poly(ethylene terephthalate) and utilized electron spin resonance spectroscopy for detection. The technique is capable of identifying plastic species as the unpaired electron of the radical molecule is strongly sensitive to its local environment through its coupling parameters. Temperature-dependent measurements revealed that the molecules are immobilized at low temperatures and exhibit well-resolved anisotropic and hyperfine spectra that are quantitatively described by a model spin Hamiltonian. Even above the melting point of water, some degrees of freedom remain blocked as a result of the polymer matrix. Furthermore, employing a time-series measurement at room temperature enabled us to determine the diffusion coefficient of the molecule in the polymer.

arXiv:2602.20401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbyne-the one-dimensional sp-hybridised allotrope of carbon-has long been predicted to exhibit unique properties, yet its synthesis remains elusive. To probe its behaviour, finite sp-carbon chains such as cumulenes and polyynes have been studied, but work to date has focused almost exclusively on short, linear systems far from the infinite carbyne limit and without considering topology. Here, we investigate long (48-carbon) linear and cyclic polyynes using steady-state and ultrafast, temperature- and polarization-resolved optical and vibrational spectroscopy. We find highly delocalized ground states in both topologies, with Peierls distortions markedly weaker than in short chains. In contrast, excited states undergo rapid self-localisation, with the localisation pathway and subsequent intersystem crossing strongly dependent on chain length and topology. Unlike shorter polyynes, excited-state structural rearrangements are minimal, and comparison with theoretical predictions shows that properties, such as Huang-Rhys factors, have plateaued by 48 carbons. Our results reveal how topology influences the electronic dynamics of long polyynes and refines our understanding of sp-carbon systems approaching the carbyne limit

Abstract: The zero-point energy of a trapped ultracold Fermi gas at unitarity is investigated in relation to the combined effects of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the Pauli principle. This lowest allowed quantum state is a superfluid state which has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically. The method used for the current investigation is based on a recent series of papers that proposed microscopic dynamics based on normal modes to describe superfluidity instead of real-space Cooper pairs. This approach yielded excellent agreement with experimental data for multiple properties and allowed the microscopic behavior underlying these results as well as the basis of universal behavior to be analyzed in detail using the group theoretic basis of this general N-body approach. This microscopic picture is now used to illucidate the roles played by the uncertainty principle and the Pauli principle in determining the energy and character of the lowest allowed quantum state including the squeezed character of this superfluid state and the suppression of the Pauli principle.

Abstract: Fractional statistics give rise to quantum behaviors that differ fundamentally from those of bosons and fermions. While two-dimensional anyons play a major role in strongly correlated systems and topological quantum computing, the nature of their one-dimensional (1D) counterparts remains the subject of intense debate, with renewed interest fueled by recent experimental progress. Theoretically, 1D anyons are predicted to host exotic many-body phases and quantum phase transitions, yet experimental signatures have remained elusive. Using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, we prepare two-body ground states of the 1D anyon-Hubbard model by combining Hamiltonian engineering via quasiperiodic drives and adiabatic state manipulation. We uncover the effects of statistical interactions that lead to pseudo-fermionization and to the formation of chiral bound states when particles remain close together. Our results establish a link between lattice and continuum realizations of anyon models, and mark important steps towards the precise control of 1D anyons in both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium settings.

Abstract: Emerging materials science platforms with the ability to make autonomous decisions on the fly are fundamentally changing the outlook and protocols for materials optimization and discovery. Because AI-driven self-navigating schemes can effectively reduce the total number of iterations needed to arrive at the "answer" (i.e. the best stochiometric composition for a desired physical property, optimum materials processing parameters, etc.) by significant margins, they have the potential to revolutionize materials and chemical manufacturing processes at large in research laboratory settings as well as in industrial plants. Here, we demonstrate a successful implementation of real-time closed-loop autonomous navigation of a multi-dimensional materials synthesis parameter space for fabricating phase-pure epitaxial films of a metastable phase of a functional oxide in a combinatorial pulsed laser deposition chamber. Sequential epitaxial growth iterations in search of the optimized recipe to stabilize the desired crystal phase were performed using frame-by-frame quantitative computer vision analysis of reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) images of the unit-cell level film being deposited. The autonomous scheme regularly resulted in > 30-fold reduction in the number of required experiments compared to a comprehensive mapping of the parameter space. The real-time workflow developed here can be readily extended to a variety of thin film synthesis platforms opening the door for self-driving atomic-level materials design as well as autonomous optimization of semiconductor manufacturing.

arXiv:2602.20443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic fragmentation of residually stressed solids involves a complex interplay between stored elastic energy, stress wave propagation, and crack instabilities. In this work, we investigate the fracture mechanics of chemically toughened glass through high-velocity projectile impact experiments and a novel micromechanical network model. We rigorously incorporate residual stress into the discrete lattice framework via a prescribed inelastic strain (eigenstrain) distribution, formulated as equivalent body and surface forces to ensure mesh-independent fracture paths. Our experiments and simulations demonstrate that while the fracture topology shifts from coarse to fine with increasing impact energy, the cumulative fragment size distribution consistently follows an exponential decay. Crucially, we reveal a universal scaling law: fragment size distributions from diverse loading conditions and stress profiles collapse onto a single master curve when normalized by the mean fragment area. Furthermore, the model elucidates the determinants of fragmentation, showing that the resulting fragment size is governed not only by the magnitude of residual stress but also by the steepness of the stress gradient. At the microscopic scale, we identify a mechanism for dynamic instability where non-sequential bond breaking ahead of the crack tip leads to apparent local crack speeds exceeding the Rayleigh wave speed ($c_r$). These arrested micro-branches, analogous to the Burridge-Andrews mechanism, provide a physical explanation for the "tongue-like" features and hackle zones observed in post-mortem fractography.

Abstract: We systematically investigate the nonlinear photogalvanic effect in few-layer graphene with various stacking orders, including AA- and AB-stacked bilayers, and AAA-, ABA-, and ABC-stacked trilayers. Using a tight-binding model to describe the electronic states, the shift current conductivity and jerk current conductivity are calculated over a broad spectral range from terahertz to visible frequencies. Our symmetry analysis reveals that a nonvanishing shift current emerges only in ABA-stacked trilayer graphene due to its broken inversion symmetry, with a peak conductivity reaching approximately $1.21 \times 10^{-13}$ A$\cdot$m/V$^2$ at optimal doping. In contrast, the jerk current, permitted in all structures, requires an in-plane static electric field and exhibits pronounced spectral tunability with chemical potential. These findings establish a comprehensive symmetry-band-field coupling paradigm for nonlinear photocurrents in layered graphene and provide design principles for tunable, polarization-sensitive photodetection and energy-harvesting devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent proposal of two-step transduction from microwave to optical domain using magnetic and elastic intermediate stages arXiv:2205.05088, we consider the coupling between resonant magnetic and elastic modes within a simple axially-symmetric nanodevice designed to host high-quality-factor acoustic modes: A suspended YIG ring structure supported by a central stem, fabricated from a continuous single-crystal film. We study the modes of the system with our custom finite element solvers. We identify the lowest order ``breathing'' mode of a magnetic vortex and the lowest order elastic breathing mode as having the largest mode overlap. For this pair of modes, the external out-of-plane magnetic bias field is critical for bringing them into resonance; however, we show that at the same time it also affects the strength of the coupling. To counteract this, we optimize the radius of the ring at fixed thickness. For the 100 nm-thick film the resonant coupling is maximized at $g/2\pi = 8\text{MHz}$ at $R\approx1.7\mu\text{m}$, indicating that the overlap integral approaches the idealized limit assumed in previous order-of-magnitude estimates. Our results pave the way for the design of tunable frequency-conversion devices based on magnetoelastics.

Abstract: Micron scale imaging of magnetic fields is an important tool for understanding the evolution of magnetism through phase transitions and as a result of interactions inside of heterostructures. However, most imaging platforms, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, are restricted to applying magnetic fields along the quantisation axis of the quantum sensor. This greatly restricts the utility of these systems for exploring materials that emit strong fields or exhibit variable response with respect to the applied field direction. Here we explore an alternative approach using weakly coupled spin-pairs in hBN that exhibit a spin-1/2-like behaviour and an isotropic response to magnetic field. We demonstrate that the spin-pair system can operate in the presence of strong fields from a thin film magnet which were incompatible with NV diamond imaging even with applied fields along the quantisation axis. Further, we demonstrate that using this platform allows for imaging with an arbitrary applied magnetic field direction, allowing us to probe the anisotropy and spin-reorientation transition in the ferrimagnet TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$. Finally, we propose an improved geometry for imaging small anisotropy contributions such as crystalline anisotropy. These results demonstrate how this or similar spin-1/2 systems might be used for imaging magnetic materials that are incompatible with other techniques despite the reduction in sensitivity compared with NV in diamond imaging.

Abstract: Flexomagnetism is the coupling between magnetism and strain gradients and is a technologically relevant phenomenon. We present a theory of elastic wave propagation in a linear elastic flexomagnetic material with microstructure and strain gradient elastic interactions. The expressions of frequency, phase velocity, and group velocity of longitudinal and transverse waves are derived and are shown to depend on the flexomagnetic coefficient and microstructure. We also show that the effect of flexomagnetism and microstructure can lead to some interesting phenomena in wave propagation, which are not observed in classical linear elasticity theory of waves. Specifically, in contrast to classical linear elastic materials, where wave propagation is non-dispersive, flexomagnetic materials with microstructure can exhibit both normal and abnormal dispersion. It is also noteworthy that, in flexomagnetic materials with gradient elasticity, the phase velocities of transverse waves can exceed those of longitudinal waves, which is atypical in classical elasticity. Furthermore, waves can also attenuate for a certain range of wavenumbers that depend on the flexomagnetic coefficient and microstructural parameters. Finally, we explore the possibility of waves exhibiting zero group velocity modes, where waves are non-propagating but have strong local energy confinement, negative group velocity modes, where the wave packet moves in the opposite direction to that of wave propagation, and the phenomenon of wave freezing, where a propagating wave stops in space without diffusing or spreading.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmion bags, as high-order topological swirling spin textures, offer rich fundamental physics and distinct advantages for spintronic applications; however, their realization remains a formidable challenge, especially in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, through model analysis, we propose a novel design principle for engineering skyrmion bags with tunable topology in symmetry-broken 2D ferromagnetic lattices. The physics correlates to the delicate interplay of isotropic exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and magnetic anisotropy, which can stabilize a rich variety of high-order topological spin states as well as the intriguing skyrmionium with zero topological charge. We further validate this mechanism in monolayer CrInTe2 using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin model simulations, revealing the existence of field-free skyrmion bags. Furthermore, we find that a weak magnetic field triggers a transition to skyrmioniums that exhibit remarkable thermal stability up to 240 K. Our results provide a compelling platform for exploring high-order topological magnetism.

Abstract: Crystalline symmetry and time-reversal symmetry are commonly present in real superconducting materials. However, the topological classification of systems respecting these symmetries, particularly for interacting fermions, remains incomplete. In this work, we systematically classify time-reversal symmetry-protected crystalline topological superconductors in two-dimensional interacting fermionic systems using an explicit real-space construction. Among the resulting phases, we identify intrinsically interacting fermionic topological superconductors, i.e., phases that cannot be realized in either free-fermion or interacting bosonic systems. For spinless fermions with protecting symmetry group $C_4 \times Z_2^T$ or $D_4 \times Z_2^T$ (plus fermion parity), the intrinsic sector has a $Z_4$ classification. The corresponding root phases generating this $Z_4$ classification admit a transparent real-space construction in terms of decorated 1D blocks. These blocks are 1D fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) phases, realizable as double Majorana chains. We further find the corresponding $Z_4$ spinless intrinsic phases for wallpaper groups $p4$, $p4m$, and $p4g$. We also find an additional $Z_2$ intrinsically interacting phase for spinless fermions with wallpaper group $pm$, which is absent with the corresponding point-group symmetry alone. Moreover, these intrinsic phases naturally give rise to higher-order FSPT phases that support corner zero modes. Finally, we verify the crystalline equivalence principle for generic 2D interacting FSPT systems with both crystalline and internal symmetries.

Abstract: In this work, we numerically verify the Jarzynski equality and Crook fluctuation theorem for a Brownian particle diffusing in a heterogeneous thermal bath and hence having a non-Gaussian position distribution. We use the diffusing-diffusivity model to take the account of heterogeneity of the thermal bath where the mobility is considered as a fluctuating quantity. The Brownian particle is confined by a time-dependent harmonic potential. By changing the stiffness coefficient, we perform an isothermal process. We use the stochastic thermodynamics framework to calculate the work. We find that the Jarzynski equality and the Crook fluctuation theorem are convincingly satisfied for a non-Gaussion system. We also find that the work distribution is non-Gaussian for diffusing-diffusivity system even at a larger process time.

Abstract: Analytical treatments of tunneling in bilayer graphene have typically relied on minimal models including only the vertical interlayer hopping $\gamma_1$ and have been restricted to the weak interlayer bias regime $2\varepsilon \ll \gamma_1$. These simplifications limit the ability of analytical theories to describe lattice deformations and strong electric-field effects. In this work, we present an analytical theory of evanescent states in electrically gapped bilayer graphene that overcomes both limitations. Specifically, our approach explicitly incorporates the skew interlayer hoppings $\gamma_3$ and $\gamma_4$ and remains valid even when the interlayer bias $2\varepsilon$ is comparable to $\gamma_1$. Focusing on low-energy electronic states near the charge neutrality point, we analytically derive the complex longitudinal wave numbers, the gap width, and the sublattice pseudospin inside the electric-field-induced gap, and systematically analyze their dependence on the interlayer shear displacement $\vec{\delta}=(\delta_x,\delta_y)$. The analytical expressions quantitatively reproduce exact numerical calculations, demonstrating that skew interlayer hoppings, in particular $\gamma_3$, play an essential role. Taking the zigzag direction as the longitudinal (transport) $x$ direction, the wave vector becomes complex along $x$ while remaining real along the transverse $y$ direction. For a monolayer--bilayer--monolayer junction with transport along this direction, we find that $\delta_y$ has a significantly stronger impact on the conductance than $\delta_x$. This anisotropic response is quantitatively explained by the analytical expressions. Furthermore, we identify a shear-induced phase proportional to $\delta_y$ that appears universally in the analytical expressions for the gap width, the sublattice pseudospin, and the decay length.

arXiv:2602.20600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the breakdown of Kondo screening by a local magnetic field from the perspective of a measurement-driven entanglement transition in a monitored quantum system. Here, the Kondo coupling leads to the growth in entanglement of an impurity spin with it's fermionic environment, while the local field plays the role of a continuous observer. Using a non-perturbative Unitary Renormalization Group (URG) approach, we derive coupled renormalization-group flow equations for the Kondo exchange and the local field, and obtain a field-dependent RG phase diagram. The RG flows separate a low-energy Kondo-screened phase, where the impurity is absorbed into the Fermi sea and forms an entangled singlet with the conduction bath, from a polarized local-moment phase in which screening is frustrated and impurity-bath entanglement is suppressed. We identify the fixed-point Hamiltonians governing the two phases and the critical regime, and relate the transition to the emergence of a novel non-Fermi liquid. Various impurity signatures such as the spectral function and thermalisation of impurity observables are used to characterise this entanglement transition. These results offer insight into the interplay of decoherence and measurement in governing the dynamics of a prototypical quantum system.

Munetaka Sasaki

arXiv:2602.20620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple model that recalls two different patterns depending on the temperature. To realize a change in recall pattern due to temperature change, we embed two patterns to different graphs: the first pattern into a fully connected graph and the second pattern into a sparse graph. Because a fully connected graph is more resistant to thermal fluctuations than a sparse graph, we can realize a change in recall pattern by tuning relative weights of the two patterns properly. We demonstrate by equilibrium Monte-Carlo simulations that such a temperature-dependent change in recall patterns does occur in our model. Simulation results strongly indicate that the system undergoes a first-order phase transition when the change in recall patterns occurs. It is also demonstrated by annealing simulations that the system fails to recall the pattern embedded in the sparse graph at low temperatures if the free-energy barrier is too high to overcome within the given simulation timescale.

Abstract: Half-metallic Heusler compounds are of significant interest for spintronics. For device fabrication, compounds that can be epitaxially grown on III-V semiconductors are particularly attractive. We present a first-principles investigation of four Co-based and two Ni-based Heusler compounds that are lattice-matched to InAs. The results of density functional theory (DFT) using semi-local and hybrid functionals are compared to quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ (QPGW). We also consider DFT with machine-learned Hubbard $U$ corrections [npj Computational Materials 6, 180 (2020)] with a new Bayesian optimization (BO) objective function to determine the $U$ values that yield the closest agreement with the QPGW band structure and magnetic moments. We find that DFT+U(BO) can adequately reproduce the key QPGW features in most cases. Our results reveal a strong method dependence of the degree of spin polarization at the Fermi level and, in some cases, even the dominant spin channel (majority or minority). Of the materials studied here, Co$_2$TiSn and Co$_2$ZrAl are the most likely to be half-metals, and Co$_2$MnIn is likely to be a near-half-metal.

Abstract: We investigate the relation of electronic and optical properties to ultrafast strain in topological antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn thin films using near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses. Coherent acoustic phonon oscillations are generated and clearly identified with a remarkably large amplitude exceeding 1% in differential transmission. Quantitative analysis reveals that near-infrared photoelastic coefficient in Mn$_3$Sn is several times larger than that in typical materials. These results establish a quantitative approach for understanding the large optical responses to ultrafast strain in the topological kagome antiferromagnet, suggesting potential opto-spintronic and optoacoustic applications even at telecommunications wavelength.

Abstract: Light-matter interaction allows to achieve non-equilibrium states that are otherwise inaccessible. Motivated by recent experiments that report ferroelectricity -- and even multiferroicity -- in the prototypical diamagnetic band insulator SrTiO$_3$ induced by terahertz pulses, we investigate the carrier and magnetization dynamics of SrTiO$_3$ excited optically by linearly and circularly polarized light. Our real-time time-dependent density-functional theory (RT-TDDFT) results reveal a highly non-trivial, site- and orbital-dependent temporal evolution with charge transferred from O $2p$ to Ti $3d$ states. For linearly polarized light the orbitally polarized lobes of electron density at the oxygen and titanium sites fluctuate out-of-phase, resembling the soft transverse optical phonon mode, dynamically breaking inversion symmetry. In contrast, circularly polarized pulses induce a coherent rotation of the charge dipoles around O. This induces a helicity-dependent finite transient magnetization with opposite sign for oxygen and Ti even without ionic motion. Detailed analysis reveals that the dominant mechanism is the transfer of angular momentum of light to the electronic orbital angular momentum, while spin-orbit coupling plays a key role in the transfer from orbital to spin angular momentum, the former being an order of magnitude larger than the latter.

arXiv:2602.20716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of memory effects in a vertically vibrated thin granular layer. Following
  a quench in the input acceleration, the granular temperature exhibits an anomalous Kovacs memory effect
  confined to the initial fast relaxation stage. This memory vanishes shortly thereafter, yielding a
  time-dependent memoryless regime governed solely by the instantaneous temperature before the system reaches
  its final steady state. We develop a kinetic theory framework that quantitatively captures these features by
  identifying the initial memory and subsequent memoryless regimes with the kinetic and hydrodynamic states,
  respectively (that are well established in kinetic theory). Our analysis reveals that memory emerges during
  fast transients through coupling between horizontal and vertical temperatures, a mechanism that fundamentally
  constrains the accessible memory phenomenology and precludes observation of the standard Kovacs effect in
  this system. Molecular dynamics simulations provide independent confirmation of all experimental and
  theoretical findings.

arXiv:2602.20740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin manipulation by hopping has recently emerged as a promising strategy to control hole spins in quantum dots using exclusively baseband control, thereby mitigating power dissipation and high-frequency management constraints in large-scale architectures. Unlike conventional approaches such as electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR), this mechanism exploits dot-to-dot variations of the spin precession axes to enable spin rotations. However, it is intrinsically disorder-dependent: in the absence of sufficient variability, the precession axes remain aligned and spin manipulation becomes ineffective. This fundamental reliance on disorder raises concerns regarding its compatibility with the long-term evolution of spin-qubit platforms toward improved material quality, cleaner interfaces, and enhanced device reproducibility. Here, we numerically assess the viability of spin manipulation by hopping as a function of disorder strength and demonstrate that its implementation is indeed increasingly constrained as disorder is reduced. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative strategy based on hopping between intentionally squeezed quantum dots. This approach retains the advantages of baseband control while being independent of disorder and robust against moderate variability, thereby offering improved prospects for scalable hole-spin quantum computing architectures.

Abstract: The emergence of phonon frequency combs exemplifies a rare and intriguing phenomenon in quantum solids. Materials with distinctive phonon band structures are especially promising for hosting such states, as their vibrational dispersion landscape across the Brillouin zone can facilitate the formation of long-lived, collective lattice excitations. In the layered Van der Waals compound InSiTe$_3$, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy reveals a pronounced anharmonicity in symmetry-predicted modes and the formation of a self-organized frequency domain structure (coherent-like state), in the range of a localized highenergy A$_{1g}$ phonon mode near 500 cm$^{-1}$. This strong phonon-phonon coupling manifests itself as an anomalous temperature dependence around 200 K, coinciding with the appearance of higher-order excitations within the phonon density of states gap. These findings position InSiTe$_3$ as an unconventional platform where intrinsic highly structured phonon spectral correlations and unusually strong anharmonic effects coexist, opening new avenues for exploring emergent vibrational phenomena in low-dimensional materials.

arXiv:2602.20754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study elementary semiconductors and insulators that are symmetric under spatial inversion: silicon, diamond, germanium, and black phosphorene. These materials are ideal candidates for realizing obstructed atomic insulators, which differ from trivial atomic insulators by a quantized spatial shift of their electronic Wannier centers with respect to the atomic lattice. We use symmetry indicator invariants that allow the prediction of non-trivial responses to crystal dislocations in these materials. We find that edge dislocations generically exhibit a non-trivial response, while screw dislocations always display a trivial response. With the aid of numerical simulations of realistic tight-binding models, we confirm the presence of mid-gap polarization bands localized along dislocations in silicon, diamond, and germanium.

arXiv:2602.20756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions among lattice, charge, and spin degrees of freedom fundamentally shape material properties. In FeSe, symmetry-breaking perturbations serve as highly sensitive probes of these couplings. Previous work has shown that defects and isoelectronic substitution can substantially alter these interactions, giving rise to additional phonon modes. In this study, uniaxial strain is employed as a tunable symmetry-breaking control parameter to probe the intrinsic lattice response in the absence of disorder. The temperature evolution of phonon excitations was examined with fine temperature resolution in the vicinity of the nemato-structural transition temperature $T_s$, under strain applied along the $\langle 110 \rangle$ and $\langle 100 \rangle$ crystallographic directions. A subtle asymmetry of the $A_{1g}^{ph}$ mode appears in the unstrained crystal within a narrow temperature window around $T_s$, originating from the emergence of an additional mode in the fully symmetric channel. With applied strain, this feature becomes more distinctly resolved. The anomaly is attributed to modifications of the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom driven by the ordering fluctuations right above the nematic transition. These fluctuations enhance susceptibility for phonon-electron-phonon coupling in the vicinity of the X and R points of the Brillouin zone and promote two-phonon scattering close to the $A_{1g}^{ph}$ mode. The presence of this two-phonon scattering depends on both the strength and the direction of the applied strain, indicating a high sensitivity of FeSe to local symmetry breaking.

Abstract: Junction spectroscopy techniques (JSTs) are powerful tools for investigating electrically active defects in semiconductors. Originally developed to study point-like defects in bulk semiconductors, JSTs have since been extended to increasingly complex systems, providing valuable insights into defect energetics and interactions. This review paper outlines the fundamental principles of JSTs and critically examines their application to emerging materials, such as perovskite solar cells and two-dimensional (2D) materials. By highlighting both the capabilities and limitations of JSTs in these non-classical systems, the review demonstrates their continued relevance and important role in advancing next-generation semiconductor materials and devices.

arXiv:2602.20776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extreme active matter system, which is essentially a dense assembly of athermal, soft and infinitely persistent active particles. Using extensive numerical simulations we obtain jammed configurations of this system in two dimensions and probe the stability of such structures under increasing active forcing magnitude. We show that the critical active forcing magnitude for the jammed phase to yield scales with virial pressure as $f_c\sim p^\alpha$, with $\alpha=1.17$, describing the yielding line. Using a Laplacian framework, we redistribute the active forces into a modified contact force network. By analysing the statistics of these redistributed forces, we obtain a very robust scaling law consistent with the passive limit, not just near the unjamming line, but in the entire jammed active phase. The probability distribution of the magnitude of the contact force deviates from the power-law form found in passive systems for values smaller than the active force. Moreover, within the jammed phase, the system displays elastic, plastic, and yielding events with increasing active forcing. This active plasticity appears abruptly and can not be captured by the continuous softening of the Hessian spectrum. However, we demonstrate that the Hessian still retains the ability to predict relaxation times. These results clarify how activity modifies force distributions and leads to deformation, plasticity and yielding in dense, jammed, infinitely persistent active matter.

Abstract: Leveraging strong optoelectronic responses to external stimuli, such as temperature and electric fields, is central to the development of advanced photonic technologies, including adaptive photodetectors and reconfigurable photovoltaic devices. However, only a limited number of semiconducting materials, typically characterized by strong electron-phonon coupling, are known to exhibit such pronounced responsiveness, and their equilibrium optoelectronic properties are often not optimally suited for targeted applications. Chemical engineering strategies, such as doping and solid-solution mixing, are therefore widely employed to fine-tune the electronic and optical properties of semiconductors. Predicting the impact of such modifications, however, remains highly challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of chemically disordered and anharmonic systems, as well as the computational limitations of conventional first-principles approaches. In this work, we introduce a new computational framework that combines ab initio electronic-structure methods with machine-learning techniques to achieve first-principles precision in the prediction of optoelectronic properties of anharmonic solid solutions at finite temperature. We apply this approach to silver chalco-halide solid solutions, an emergent class of optoelectronic materials that have been experimentally shown to exhibit large band-gap tunability and strong responses to thermal excitations. Our results provide quantitative insight into the interplay between chemical disorder, lattice dynamics, and electronic structure in these materials. More broadly, this study establishes a general strategy for the accurate modeling of optoelectronic functionality in chemically disordered semiconductors.

Jose Carlos Pelayo, Ippei Danshita

arXiv:2602.20780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate signatures of non-ergodic behavior in the real-time evolution of a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, where the initial state is a doubly occupied density-wave state. We show that the occupation dynamics at strong interactions is dominated by doublon-holon exchange which leads to a domain wall excitation and propagation. The latter manifests as a negated staggered pattern in the density-density correlations. While the single-particle and the pair correlation functions show highly localized correlations that decay rapidly away from the nearest neighbor. We show that the time scale of the domain-wall excitations depends on the inverse of the interaction strength and therefore dictates the slow relaxation dynamics. In the presence of a parabolic trap, the occupation dynamics at the edges become frozen and further suppresses the propagation of correlations. This suppression happens even for trap strengths weaker than the tunneling rate. We also show that the model can be mapped to an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model in the limit of strong interactions and that the correlation-propagation velocity in the original model is well captured by the group velocity of the spin-wave excitation in the effective spin model.

Abstract: Compositionally complex solid solutions provide a unique route for engineering high-performance electrocatalysts, where the polyelemental surface composition can be seamlessly tuned to optimize activity, selectivity, and stability. However, the mechanistic understanding of these electrocatalysts remains limited by the lack of a model system with a crystallographically-defined surface that is compatible with correlative, multi-scale characterization. Here, we present epitaxial films as a model platform for studying compositionally complex electrocatalysts. Using magnetron sputtering, we realize (111) epitaxial Ir-Pd-Pt-Rh-Ru films on (0001) sapphire substrate via a (111) Pt buffer layer, confirmed by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The growth approach is applicable across a broad composition range and produces smooth surfaces (root mean square roughness < 1 nm) with micrometer-sized grains in the nanoscale films. With these films, we demonstrate direct structure-activity mapping at the nanoscale through precise co-localization using micro-indents and performing correlative atomic force microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. Our work establishes a model platform for fundamental scalebridging characterization and paves the way for rational design of compositionally complex electrocatalysts.

arXiv:2602.20803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a cantilevered elastic beam subjected to harmonic rotational motion. In the rotating frame, the beam experiences centrifugal and Euler fictitious forces, with negligible Coriolis effects. We validate a reduced-order \textit{elastica} model through precision experiments on slender beams rotating with a controlled sinusoidal angular velocity. Systematically exploring the parameter space, we identify regimes where inertial effects are negligible, enabling a quasi-static treatment despite harmonic driving. We characterize the transition to dynamic response using two dimensionless parameters, the Euler and centrifugal numbers, which compare centrifugal and Euler forces to bending forces. Counterintuitively, the quasi-static regime expands as rotational speed increases: faster rotation produces less dynamic response. The critical Euler number separating these regimes remains constant at low centrifugal numbers but follows square-root scaling at higher rotation rates, a transition driven by centrifugal stiffening. Our results establish the conditions under which quasi-static approximations remain valid for rotating flexible beams under harmonic driving.

Abstract: We present an approach to parameterize DFT+$U$+$V$ from hybrid-functional calculations using Wannier-function projections. The method constructs a common localized Wannier basis for both semilocal DFT and hybrid-functional calculations, then determines effective on-site ($U$) and intersite ($V$) Hubbard parameters by minimizing the Hamiltonian mismatch within the correlated subspace. This procedure yields interaction parameters that reproduce the hybrid-functional electronic structure at a fraction of the computational cost and allow efficient structural relaxations and further many-body calculations. We validate the workflow on three oxide systems with different electronic characters: MgO (wide-gap insulator), NiO (antiferromagnetic charge-transfer insulator), and V$_2$O$_5$ (d$^0$ transition-metal oxide). In all cases, the mapped DFT+$U$+$V$ parameters reproduce hybrid-functional band gaps, densities of states, and magnetic moments and improve upon semilocal DFT while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin dependent transport in altermagnet/triplet superconductor/altermagnet (AM/TSC/AM) junctions in the presence of interfacial Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC). Within a microscopic Bogoliubov de Gennes scattering formalism, we compute angle and energy resolved conductance, spin polarization, zero bias response, and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) for nodal $p_x$ and chiral $p_x+ip_y$ superconductors. Although altermagnets carry no net magnetization, the momentum dependent spin splitting, combined with RSOC, enables a pronounced spin valve effect without ferromagnetic electrodes. We show that conductance, spin polarization, and TMR exhibit distinct and robust fingerprints of the triplet pairing symmetry. For nodal $p_x$ superconductor, sign change induced surface Andreev bound states dominate subgap transport, producing strongly anisotropic conductance, giant zero bias spin polarization, and a monotonic enhancement of TMR with increasing RSOC. In contrast, the chiral $p_x+ip_y$ state exhibits smoother conductance and polarization profiles governed by topological edge modes, resulting in broader, lobe like TMR patterns with weaker sensitivity to interface transparency. Moreover, RSOC can acts as an electrically tunable spin-mixing knob, while the barrier strength controls coherence and energy selectivity, together enabling large, symmetry controlled spin filtering and magnetoresistance. Our results establish AM/TSC/AM junctions as a symmetry sensitive transport platform for realizing electrically tunable spin valve functionality and probing triplet pairing without ferromagnetic components.

Abstract: Magnetic impurities in real materials can mask the intrinsic spin-dependent properties of hosts. They interact indirectly through the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism, which limits the use of isolated impurity spins in applications such as qubits and spintronics. Suppressing the RKKY interaction would therefore enable access to the host's unperturbed behavior while simultaneously isolating impurity spins for functional use. Although single-color laser driving can suppress the RKKY interaction, it typically requires strong fields that may be impractical or destabilizing. To overcome these limitations, we show that two-color laser driving provides efficient and tunable control over all components of the RKKY interaction using two weak laser fields. Focusing on two-dimensional Rashba altermagnets, we show that interference between one- and two-photon processes produces altermagnet-specific Floquet corrections. These include additional AC Stark shifts, magnetizations, spin-orbit renormalization, and emergent in-plane Zeeman fields that are absent under single-color driving and in non-altermagnetic systems. Notably, two-color driving induces a finite $z$-component of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, stabilizing in-plane chiral magnetism and related textures in Rashba altermagnets. These effects enable tunable, near-complete on-off switching of the Heisenberg, Ising, and DM interactions through a Lifshitz-like modulation of the Fermi surface. We also show that the tuning process is highly sensitive to the chirality of both beams. We further map phase diagrams for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic impurity alignment with clockwise and counterclockwise canting as functions of Rashba coupling and altermagnetic order. Finally, we discuss candidate material platforms and experimental feasibility.

Abstract: We study quantum transport in disordered topological insulator nanowires (TINWs) under axial magnetic flux. At integer flux quanta, spin-momentum locking produces weak anti-localization peaks, while at half-integer flux quanta a helical mode protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS) suppresses backscattering. By analyzing the flux dependence of the localization length, we uncover critical scaling around half-integer flux quanta, reflecting the competition between disorder scattering and flux-induced breaking of TRS protection. As the disorder strength increases, we identify a crossover in scaling behavior that drives the system into a regime governed by a universal critical exponent. Our results demonstrate a scaling collapse across flux values, establishing a universal regime of flux-driven delocalization in TINWs.

Abstract: The rheological properties of biological tissues, though fundamental to many physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and tumor progression, remain poorly understood. A recent study showed that the active vertex model of biological tissues exhibits discontinuous shear thickening (DST), where stress and viscosity suddenly increase at a critical shear rate. What is the mechanism of DST here? Is it another nontrivial feature of activity or an inherent property of the system? To address this, we show that the thermal vertex model also exhibits DST at a small but non-zero temperature $T$. Solid-like and liquid-like cells coexist at the stress jump, and the stress-controlled flow curves exhibit the characteristic S-shape. We then introduce a constitutive model for DST in epithelial tissues. As $p_0$ increases, the theory predicts DST, followed by continuous shear thickening (CST), and finally Newtonian behavior, consistent with simulations. DST begins at the jamming point, $p_0^m$, and the Newtonian behavior starts at $p_0^*$, where the yield stress vanishes. Both $p_0^*$ and the liquid-to-solid transition stress, $\sigma^*$, govern the DST-CST boundary. Furthermore, $p_0^*$ and $\sigma^*$ also depend on $T$. Increasing $T$ reduces $p_0^*$, narrows the shear-thickening regime, and eventually destroys DST when $p_0^* \leq p_0^m$. Thus, the primary ingredients of DST in tissue models are a finite yield stress in the unjammed regime and non-zero fluctuations, whose specific form is not important. The theory agrees well with our simulation data and also provides further testable predictions.

arXiv:2602.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotopic substitution modifies nuclear masses without altering the electronic potential energy surface to first order and is therefore often interpreted as a simple rescaling of vibrational frequencies. In solids with dense phonon manifolds, however, mass substitution acts as a parametric Hermitian deformation of the mass-weighted dynamical matrix, generating a continuous family of eigenproblems whose eigenvectors can undergo substantial rotation within coupled subspaces. Here we investigate protiated and deuterated ZIF-8 using inelastic neutron scattering and density functional theory lattice-dynamics calculations. While many vibrational modes exhibit near-ideal mass scaling and preserve their character across isotopic endpoints, modes embedded in spectrally congested regions display pronounced redistribution of vibrational character that cannot be inferred from frequency shifts alone. Because inelastic neutron scattering intensity is directly weighted by hydrogen displacement amplitude, spectral sparsity and congestion provide experimental indicators of predictable frequency renormalisation or susceptibility to qualitative eigenvector reorganisation under deuteration. To establish physically meaningful mode correspondence, we develop an adiabatic eigenvector-continuation framework with overlap-based tracking and explicit stability diagnostics. These results show that vibrational identity in complex framework materials is best understood as a continuous trajectory in eigenvector space and provide a general framework for analysing isotope-induced spectral flow in dense phonon systems.

Abstract: CrSBr is a van der Waals magnetic semiconductor exhibiting antiferromagnetic order below 140 K. It has emerged as a promising platform for engineering 2D magnetism because its intertwined electronic, optical, and magnetic properties can be profoundly modified via external stimuli such as electrical gating or magnetic fields. However, other strategies for tuning magnetism in layered materials, such as molecular intercalation, remain largely unexplored for CrSBr. Here, we demonstrate that the intercalation of tetramethylammonium (TMA) and tetrapropylammonium (TPA) ions into CrSBr induces a transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic order, while significantly enhancing the magnetic transition temperature to 190 K (TMA) and 230 K (TPA). The resulting intercalates are air-stable and exhibit large, hysteretic magnetoresistance exceeding 60% at 50 K in the TPA case. Besides, intercalation introduces symmetry-breaking structural changes in each CrSBr plane, revealed by Raman microscopy and corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These findings highlight molecular intercalation as a powerful and versatile route to tailor the magnetic properties of CrSBr and unlock its potential to fabricate robust, high-temperature 2D magnetic devices.

arXiv:2602.20959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining atomic structure from spectroscopic data is central to materials science but remains restricted to a limited set of techniques and material classes, largely due to the computational cost and complexity of structural refinement. Here we introduce ActiveStructOpt, a general framework that integrates graph neural network surrogate models with active learning to efficiently determine candidate structures that reproduce target spectra with minimal computational expenditure. Benchmarking with X-ray pair distribution function data, and with the more computationally demanding simulations of X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), demonstrate that ActiveStructOpt reliably determines structures that match closely in spectra across diverse materials classes. Under equivalent computational budgets, ActiveStructOpt outperforms existing structure determination methods. By enabling data-efficient, multi-objective structural refinement across a broad range of computable spectroscopic techniques, ActiveStructOpt provides a flexible and extensible approach to atomic structure determination in complex materials.

Abstract: The development of high-performing sensing materials, able to detect ppb-trace concentrations of volatile organic compounds at low temperatures, is required for the development of next-generation miniaturized wireless sensors. Here, we present the engineering of selective room-temperature chemical sensors, comprising highly porous tin dioxide (SnO2) - graphene oxide (GO) nano-heterojunction layouts. The optoelectronic and chemical properties of these highly porous (above 90%) p-n heterojunctions were systematically investigated in terms of composition and morphologies. Optimized SnO2-GO layouts demonstrate significant potential as both visible-blind photodetectors and as selective room-temperature chemical sensors. Notably, a low GO content results in an excellent UV light responsivity (400A x W-1), with short rise and decay times, and room-temperature high chemical sensitivity with selective detection of volatile organic compounds such as ethanol down to 100~ppb. In contrast, a high concentration of GO drastically decreases the room-temperature response to ethanol and results in good selectivity to ethylbenzene. The feasibility of tuning the chemical selectivity of the sensor response by engineering the relative amount of GO and SnO2 is a promising feature that may guide the future development of miniaturized solid-state gas sensors. Furthermore, the excellent optoelectronic properties of these SnO2-GO nano-heterojunctions may find applications in various other areas such as optoelectronic devices and (photo)electrocatalysis.

Abstract: The auxiliary mode approach to time-dependent open quantum system calculations is implemented and refined to yield a feasible computational approach to simulate nanostructures far from equilibrium. It is done by a careful diagonalization of the electrode level-width function, and provides an efficient approach which can simulate large, open systems at the level of time-dependent density functional theory. The approach, as given in this work, is implemented in the new open-source code Zandpack. The framework is applied to three systems perturbed by the same THz electromagnetic field pulse-form: 1) A Hubbard model for hydrogen on graphene is used to calculate spin-currents, mutual information, spin-transitions, and a pump-probe setup. 2) An armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) probed by a metal tip showing electrons excited from the valence band of the AGNR into the tip via electron-electron interactions. 3) A gold break-junction is modeled with various gap distances, and displays behavior that is more different from the adiabatic case as the gap widens. In the examples 2 and 3, we develop and use a general linearization scheme for time-dependent open system calculations, which utilizes the DFTB+ or SIESTA codes.

arXiv:2602.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties of the one-dimensional dimerized Fermi-Hubbard model. Using a matrix-product-state approach, we compute the ground state and identify two insulating phases at 1/2- and 3/4-filling, along with a metallic phase, whose mechanisms can be characterized by their entanglement spectra. Our findings indicate that the two insulating phases are distinct, implying that the phase at 1/2-filling has a charge gap arising from the band gap, which is enhanced by repulsive interactions, while the phase at 3/4-filling exhibits a Mott gap resulting from particle interactions. This difference between the two insulating phases is reflected in the scaling properties of the half-chain entanglement entropy and the distribution of the entanglement spectrum.

arXiv:2602.20998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum oscillations, the oscillatory behavior of electrical and thermodynamic properties, are typically observed in metals and vanish in the quantum limit under strong magnetic fields1. Phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect2, the Hofstadter butterfly3,4, and recent observations of quantum oscillations in exotic insulators are notable exceptions5-12. The narrow-gap Dirac semiconductor ZrTe5, a less exotic material without strong correlations or artificially engineered superlattices, nevertheless exhibits resistance oscillations in the quantum limit13 but can be interpreted within a simple Zeeman-effect-based picture14,15, which remains conventional quantum oscillations without exotic properties. Here, we report the observation of unexpected mini-oscillations superimposed on Zeeman-effect-induced main oscillations in the quantum limit. The subtracted mini-oscillations are periodic in 1/B with the highest frequency equal to 2.1% of the first Brillouin zone and have extremely heavy effective mass ~ 2me, which is unexpected in ZrTe5 given its ultralow carrier density. Additionally, the mini-oscillations exhibit sequential features that are synchronized with the main oscillations, suggesting an internal structure of the Landau bands. However, they appear incompatible with the Hofstadter butterfly due to the highly anisotropic/three-dimensional crystal structure. These sequential mini-oscillations correlate with the commensurability resonance effect with subunity fractions observed in angular magnetoresistance, relating to the formation of mini-Landau bands. Our results present solid experimental evidence of exotic quantum oscillations in the quantum limit beyond currently available mechanisms, and establish ZrTe5, a prototypical Dirac semiconductor, as a simple platform parallel to correlated insulators for exploring exotic oscillations.

Loris Di Cairano

arXiv:2602.21003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions are conventionally defined by nonanalyticities of thermodynamic potentials in the thermodynamic limit. In this Letter, we show that the singularity is not the definition of criticality but its asymptotic outcome: criticality is already written in the microcanonical entropy derivatives at any finite size as intrinsic morphological structures -- inflection points and extrema. The singularity is then the endpoint of a sharpening process that evolves with increasing system size. Combining microcanonical inflection-point analysis (MIPA) with the Berlin-Kac spherical model -- for which the microcanonical density of states is known in closed form at every finite $N$ -- we systematically identify these structures in the energy profiles of entropy derivatives that encode the transition. An inflection point in the inverse temperature $\beta_N(\epsilon)=\partial_\epsilon S_N$ and a pronounced peak in its derivative $\gamma_N(\epsilon)=\partial^2_\epsilon S_N$ define a well-controlled pseudocritical trajectory whose controlled sharpening and drift culminate in the macroscopic cusp at the critical energy $\epsilon_c$ in the thermodynamic limit. This establishes an intrinsic, order-parameter-free notion of criticality that precedes its singular asymptotic representation.

arXiv:2602.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To interpret molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is common practice to reduce the dimensionality of the molecular coordinates to a low-dimensional collective variable $x$. Projecting the high-dimensional MD data onto $x$ yields a free energy landscape $\Delta G(x)$, which highlights low-energy regions corresponding to conformational states. The accurate definition of these states, however, is often impeded by projection artifacts, resulting in artificially shortened state lifetimes or even the complete disappearance of states from the analysis. As demonstrated for a two-dimensional toy model, Gaussian low-pass filtering of the high-dimensional MD coordinates can restore the underlying free energy landscape, allowing to recover previously hidden states. When applied to an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, the number of microstates increases by an order of magnitude, which leads to metastable states that are long-lived and much better defined structurally, even compared to dynamically cored state trajectories.

Abstract: Condensed matter compounds typically form crystals, which break the rotational and translational invariance of space but remain invariant under a discrete set of symmetry operations. Understanding the effects allowed by this symmetry breaking, as well as the constraints imposed by the crystal structure, is a crucial problem in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a Python package for determining the symmetry-restricted forms of tensors describing physical properties of crystals, focusing particularly on magnetic materials. The primary focus is on response tensors; however, the program can also describe equilibrium properties and other physical properties, such as magnetic interactions. The program can describe the symmetry using the conventional magnetic space groups, as well as using the spin groups that describe the non-relativistic limit. Additional functionality includes the treatment of quantities projected onto a particular site and expansions in the magnetic order parameter. The code can be used either from the command line or via a Python API.

Abstract: We investigate the effective interaction between two localized spin impurities embedded in a frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1\!-\!J_2$ Heisenberg chain. Treating the impurity spins as classical moments coupled locally to the host, we combine second--order perturbation theory with large--scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations to determine the impurity--impurity interaction as a function of separation, coupling strength, and magnetic frustration. In the weak--coupling regime, we show that the interaction is governed by the the static spin susceptibility of the host and exhibits oscillatory power--law decay in the gapless phase, modified by universal logarithmic corrections at the SU(2)--symmetric critical point. In the gapped dimerized phase, the interaction decays exponentially with distance. For intermediate and strong impurity--host coupling, we observe a crossover to a boundary--dominated regime characterized by pronounced parity effects associated with the length of the chain segment between impurities, signaling a breakdown of the simple RKKY--like description. Our results establish impurity--impurity interactions as a sensitive probe of frustrated quantum spin liquids and provide a controlled framework for distinguishing gapless and gapped phases through local perturbations.

Abstract: This study establishes a direct correlation between in situ irradiation-induced property changes measured by transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) and the resulting microstructural damage in Cu-Cr-Ta alloys. Thin films fabricated by physical vapor deposition were irradiated with 6.6 MeV Cu +3 ions up to 25 DPA, while TGS continuously monitored the evolution of surface acoustic wave (SAW) frequency and thermal diffusivity. Post-irradiation transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to quantify void formation as a metric of accumulated radiation damage. A pronounced decrease in SAW frequency was observed some seconds after the onset of irradiation, and it was found to correlate strongly with the final void density. Vacancy MEB calculations propose that the small decrease in SAW frequency is associated with the low population of mobile vacancies, promoting defect recombination and decreasing void formation. This relationship enables early prediction of relative radiation damage resistance within minutes of irradiation, substantially reducing the time required compared to conventional irradiation and postcharacterization routes, allowing rapid screening of multiple compositions. We were able to test this method with 3 compositions of the Cu-Cr-Ta system. More generally, this in situ approach provides an efficient pathway for accelerating the development of materials for radiation environments.

arXiv:2602.21108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic dimensions are a powerful tool for engineering desired quantum systems, based on coupling together sets of states and reinterpreting these as lattice sites along an artificial dimension. Recently, a synthetic dimension of harmonic trap states has been successfully implemented in an ultracold atom experiment, opening the way for future realizations in this platform of topological lattice models, such as hybrid Harper-Hofstadter (HH) systems, which have one real and one synthetic dimension. However, unlike conventional systems, inter-particle interactions along a synthetic dimension of harmonic trap states are inhomogeneous, long-ranged and non-state-preserving. Therefore, this setup provides a natural platform for the exploration of the interplay between long range interactions (including correlated pair tunneling) and magnetic effects. In this paper, we set out to numerically study the effect of such interactions on both a hybrid two-legged HH ladder and a 2D HH model. In the former, we find variants of vortex and Meissner phases familiar from conventional models, while in the latter, we observe the emergence, in small finite systems, of unusual ground states, including a ``Meissner stripe" state, which combines counter-propagating Meissner-like currents with strong density variations. This opens up interesting questions, including about the nature of strongly-correlated states that would emerge in such a platform.

Abstract: The presence of strong disorder can significantly impact electrical conduction in metallic systems. Here, we investigate the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity, $\rho(T)$, in nonmagnetic single crystals of the Remeika-phase cage compounds R$_3$Co$_4$Ge$_{13}$ (R = Y, Lu). Contrary to the density of states (DOS) calculations in the literature, the experimentally measured $\rho(T)$ in both compounds exhibits semiconducting-like behavior, which we attribute to the strong structural disorder due to its unique crystal structure and low carrier-density. A detailed analysis of the electrical resistivity data reveals that neither the Arrhenius thermal activation law nor variable-range hopping (VRH) models can adequately describe their temperature dependence over the broad temperature range of 2-350 K. However, a model incorporating parallel conduction through both semiconducting and metallic channels provides an adequate explanation. In addition to a dominant metallic conduction below $\sim 10$~K, a negative temperature coefficient of the electrical resistivity ($d\rho/dT$) is found in both samples. In the absence of magnetic impurities, the observed $d\rho/dT < 0$ is interpreted in terms of the structural Kondo mechanism.

arXiv:2602.21117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A micromagnetic framework for magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is presented that accounts for weak symmetric anisotropic exchange in centrosymmetric nanocrystalline ferromagnets. The exchange interaction is expressed via a general fourth-rank tensor decomposed into isotropic and deviatoric parts. We start with the exchange energy and effective field, assuming weakly fluctuating in space saturation magnetization, solve micromagnetic problem to find spatial distribution of local magnetization vector and compute the averaged (over random orientations of nanocrystals) SANS cross sections. The isotropic part reproduces the classical Heisenberg-type SANS response, while non-zero deviatoric part of the exchange tensor gives rise to new angular harmonics in the magnetic SANS cross section. As a specific example, analytical response functions for an exchange tensor with hexagonal symmetry in perpendicular and parallel scattering geometries are derived. The results provide a basis for identifying and quantifying symmetric exchange anisotropy in magnetic SANS experiments.

Abstract: Magnetic hopfions in chiral magnets are topological solitons, localized in three dimensions. But is their localization strong? To address this question we derive an asymptotic expansion for the isolated hopfion's spatial profile. It becomes starting point for a simple analytical model, which is asymptotically correct both near the hopfion center and far away from it. Region of equilibrium hopfions on the phase diagram of a helimagnet is computed and material requirements for supporting movable isolated magnetic hopfions on uniform background are discussed.

Manish Patel, Amir Shee

arXiv:2602.21134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertia is intrinsic to many living and synthetic active systems, from animals and robotic agents to colloidal swimmers, and it strongly shapes transport. Many such systems employ intermittent restart protocols to regulate exploration. Stochastic resetting provides a theoretical framework for these strategies and a route to control nonequilibrium steady states, yet the role of inertia in reset-controlled active dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we study an inertial active Brownian particle subject to complete stochastic resetting of position, velocity, and orientation in two dimensions. Using a moment-generating framework together with the Final-Value Theorem, we derive closed-form steady-state moments up to fourth order as functions of inertia, activity, and reset rate. We show that inertia fundamentally modifies reset-controlled transport: at large reset rates the steady-state mean-squared displacement is suppressed much more strongly than in the overdamped limit, yielding enhanced localization near the reset point. At the same time, position excess-kurtosis phase diagrams reveal strongly non-Gaussian steady states characterized by a sharp central peak coexisting with heavy tails in the position distribution, indicating rare long excursions enabled by inertial persistence. The tail weight varies non-monotonically with reset rate, reflecting a competition between inertial momentum relaxation and resetting that selects an optimal regime maximizing rare excursions. Our results provide experimentally testable signatures of inertial effects in reset-controlled active systems.

arXiv:2602.21135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phenomena concerning altermagnets have opened up a window for unconventional analysis of the momentum space spin polarization (MSSP) of antiferromagnetic materials. Taking the example of one of the widely investigated altermagnets, CrSb, we explore the underlying mechanisms leading to the formation or breaking of altermagnetism. With the aid of DFT calculation and symmetry analysis, we study the behavior of MSSP in the altermagnetic bands of pristine CrSb, along with a few model structures designed from the pristine one by hypothetical vacancy engineering and interstitial doping. We show that the six-fold rotational symmetry of the pristine CrSb can be reduced to a two-fold rotational symmetry via vacancy and doping engineering. We discover the formation of fragmented nodal curves (FNCs) across the Brillouin zone when in an altermagnetic material when the symmetry is restricted to two-fold rotation. Unlike the typical nodal planes and axes, the location of the FNCs in the momentum space is found to be band-specific. The formation of FNCs is further validated by introducing uniaxial strain to CrSb and by examining the band structure of RbMnPO$_4$, as they both exhibit a two-fold rotational symmetry responsible for altermagnetism. We observe that, unlike the pristine case, these FNCs have the potential to manifest anomalous Hall conductivities (AHC), while the N\'eel vector orients along both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. This flexibility of the AHC will pave the way for the application of altermagnets in the futuristic quantum devices.

Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum emulation using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and an increased interest in topological Green's function zeros in condensed matter systems, we here study Green's function zeros in topological Floquet systems. We concentrate on interacting Kitaev-like Floquet chains (or equivalently transverse field Ising circuits) and introduce Floquet Green's-function-based topological invariants for the corresponding symmetry class BDI. In the vicinity of special points in the free fermion phase diagram and using tailor-made interactions which lead to the Floquet version of symmetric mass generation, we analytically calculate both edge and bulk Green's functions. Just as in the case of continuum time evolution, topological bands of Green's function zeros may also contribute to the topological invariant. However, contrary to the case of continuum time evolution, Floquet Green's functions can have zeros even in the absence of interactions. Finally, we also discuss an implementation of this Floquet system in a digital quantum emulator: We present a circuit which encodes the interaction under consideration and pinpoint the observables carrying information about the topological Green's function boundary zeros.

arXiv:2602.21206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the $t$-$J$ model, variational wave functions can generally be constructed based on an accurate description of antiferromagnetism (AFM) at half-filling and an exact phase-string sign structure under doping. The single-hole-doped and two-hole-doped states, as determined by variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulations, display sharply contrasting behaviors. The single-hole state constitutes a ``cat state'' that resonates strongly between a quasiparticle component and a local loop-current component, with approximately equal weights. In the ground state, the quasiparticle spectral weight $Z_{\mathbf{k}}$ peaks at momenta $\mathbf{k}_0 \equiv (\pm\frac{\pi}{2},\pm\frac{\pi}{2})$. The total-energy dispersion versus $\mathbf{k}$ agrees remarkably well with the Green function Monte Carlo results. However, Landau's one-to-one correspondence hypothesis for quasiparticles breaks down here with the incoherent component exhibiting intrinsic magnetization originating from a minimal $2\times2$ loop current that forms a $4\times4$ pattern on the square lattice--a finding in excellent agreement with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. In the two-hole ground state, a new pairing mechanism is revealed: the two holes are automatically fused into a tightly bound object consisting of an incoherent $d_{xy}$ pairing along the diagonal direction by compensating the local loop currents. This hole pair is again a ``cat state'' that resonates strongly between the incoherent $d_{xy}$ and a coherent $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Cooper channel to gain substantial hopping energy. Its size extends over an area of about $4\times 4$ lattice spacings, much smaller than the divergent AFM correlation length, implying that it should survive as a minimal superconducting building block even in the dilute doping regime. Experimental implications and the generalization to the finite-doping case are briefly addressed.

Jiace Sun, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan

arXiv:2602.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many computational methods in ab initio quantum chemistry are formulated in terms of high-order tensor contractions, whose cost determines the size of system that can be studied. We introduce stochastic tensor contraction to perform such operations with greatly reduced cost, and present its application to the gold-standard quantum chemistry method, coupled cluster theory with up to perturbative triples. For total energy errors more stringent than chemical accuracy, we reduce the computational scaling to that of mean-field theory, while starting to approach the mean-field absolute cost, thereby challenging the existing cost-to-accuracy landscape. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art local correlation approximations further show that we achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in both total computation time and error, with significantly reduced sensitivity to system dimensionality and electron delocalization. We conclude that stochastic tensor contraction is a powerful computational primitive to accelerate a wide range of quantum chemistry.

Abstract: Efficient transmission of elastic waves across interfaces is central to several applications, including medical imaging, seismic isolation, and transducer design. Interfaces with abrupt changes in the material properties significantly impede wave transmission, leading to reflections. This limitation, known as impedance mismatch, becomes even more prominent for mode conversion between different wave types due to polarization mismatch. In this study, we investigate a mechanism employing two-dimensional functionally graded anisotropic metamaterials to facilitate longitudinal--shear mode conversion as waves propagate from a stiff to a compliant medium. By embedding density and anisotropic shape gradients within the functionally graded metamaterial, polarization-induced impedance mismatch is mitigated and efficient mode conversion is enabled. We use unit cell dispersion analysis to tailor the frequency range for mode conversion through gradation in the dispersion behavior and coupling between modes. Using frequency-domain finite element analysis, we demonstrate broadband mode conversion across interfaces with large stiffness contrast operating in the 1--10 kHz range. We then experimentally validate and quantify mode conversion through full-field velocity measurements on an additively manufactured specimen. We further apply the methodology to design a device capable of converting radial--tangential wave modes.

Abstract: The thermoelastic metamaterial based on a bimaterial hybrid-honeycomb structure, exhibiting simultaneously negative Poisson's ratios and negative thermal expansion coefficients is very promising for various application. This work is dedicated to the machine learning (ML)-enabled inverse design of such structure, on the basis of high-throughput simulation and neural network models. A large dataset is generated through computational homogenization of structures with varying geometrical features and base material properties. A forward ML model is first trained to efficiently and accurately predict the effective thermoelastic properties for a given structure design. Subsequently, inverse ML models are developed to suggest geometrical features and base materials for desired target properties. To address various inverse design scenarios, six different models are proposed, each defined by different combinations of target effective properties and structural design variables. The trained forward model is integrated into the loss functions of the inverse models and is also employed to generate additional datasets for cases with fixed base materials. The good predictive performance of the forward and inverse ML models is demonstrated by representative design examples. These ML models can be applied to efficiently solving specific inverse design tasks involved in the practical application of the thermoelastic metamaterial in novel engineering systems.

Abstract: Known holographic dictionaries, especially AdS/CFT, rely on symmetry matching between the bulk and the boundary. We take a step toward a holographic dictionary with no symmetry requirement and without assuming the geometry being asymptotically AdS. Starting from any interacting Majorana generalized free field on a $(0+1)$d boundary and its two-point function data, we derive a concise analytic formula for the dual $(1+1)$d bulk geometry, borrowing techniques from unitary matrix integral and inverse scattering. Using this formula, we compute the near-horizon curvature, give conditions for positive versus negative curvature, and identify simple boundary models with de Sitter or anti-de Sitter near-horizon duals. We also study the large-$q$ SYK model, finding an unusual temperature dependence of the near-horizon curvature, related to the discrepancy between physical temperature and the ``fake disk'' temperature. We also construct, directly from boundary operators, approximate algebras generated by null translations and boost that become exact at the bifurcate horizon.

arXiv:2602.20299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We approach the 3-SAT satisfiability problem with the quantum-inspired method of imaginary time propagation (ITP) applied to matrix product states (MPS) on a classical computer. This ansatz is fundamentally limited by a quantum entanglement barrier that emerges in imaginary time, reflecting the exponential hardness expected for this NP-complete problem. Strikingly, we argue based on careful analysis of the structure imprinted onto the MPS by the 3-SAT instances that this barrier arises from classical computational complexity. To reveal this connection, we elucidate with stochastic models the specific relationship between the classical hardness of the $\sharp$P $\supseteq$ NP-complete counting problem $\sharp$3-SAT and the entanglement properties of the quantum state. Our findings illuminate the limitations of this quantum-inspired approach and demonstrate how purely classical computational complexity can manifest in quantum entanglement. Furthermore, we present estimates of the non-stabilizerness required by the protocol, finding a similar resource barrier. Specifically, the necessary amount of non-Clifford operations scales superlinearly in system size, thus implying extensive resource requirements of ITP on different architectures such as Clifford circuits or gate-based quantum computers.

Abstract: Halide perovskite quantum dots exhibit cooperative optical phenomena that are absent in conventional semiconductor nanocrystals, including exciton superradiance, superabsorption, and biexciton superradiance within individual dots. Here we develop a microscopic theory that identifies the physical origin of these Dicke effects and establishes how they can be controlled by materials parameters. The central result is that cooperative emission emerges from a competition between collective coupling of optical transition dipoles and lattice-induced disorder, with the balance governed by the Raman-derived phonon spectral density and the excitonic oscillator strength. At elevated temperature, strong Fr\"ohlich coupling and glassy lattice dynamics produce dynamic disorder that suppresses dipole synchronization and yields incoherent emission. Upon cooling, lattice fluctuations freeze and cooperative coherence emerges when the collective coupling exceeds residual static disorder, defining size- and composition-dependent crossover temperatures that we map as phase diagrams. Extending the framework to biexcitons, we show that a confined biexciton constitutes a single correlated charge distribution dressed by a shared lattice configuration, enabling pathway-indistinguishable decay and cooperative radiative enhancement. The theory quantitatively accounts for observed size, composition, and temperature trends in radiative-rate constant ratios and biexciton binding energies, while explaining why full Dicke saturation is not universal. More broadly, the results establish Raman spectral weight and oscillator strength as design parameters for engineering cooperative quantum-optical behavior in quantum materials.

Abstract: A cluster state is a strongly entangled state, which is a source of measurement-based quantum computation. It is generated by applying controlled-Z (CZ) gates to the state $\left\vert ++\cdots +\right\rangle $. It is protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{ \text{odd}}$ symmetry. By applying general quantum gates to the state $ \left\vert ++\cdots +\right\rangle $, we systematically obtain a general short-range entangled cluster state. If we use a non-Clifford gate such as the controlled phase-shift gate, we obtain a non-Clifford cluster state. Furthermore, if we use the controlled-controlled Z (CCZ) gate instead of the CZ gate, we obtain non-Clifford cluster states with five-body entanglement. We generalize it to the C$^{N}$Z gate, where $(2N+1)$-body entangled states are generated. The $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{odd}}$ symmetry is non-Clifford for $N\geq 3$. We demonstrate that there emerge $2^{2N}$ fold degenerate ground states for an open chain, indicating the emergence of $N$ free spins at each edge. They can be used as an $N$-qubit input and an $N$-qubit output in measurement-based quantum computation. We also study the non-invertible symmetry, the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation and the string-order parameter in addition to the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{odd}}$ symmetry in these models.

Abstract: The term 'algorithmic fairness' is used to evaluate whether AI models operate fairly in both comparative (where fairness is understood as formal equality, such as "treat like cases as like") and non-comparative (where unfairness arises from the model's inaccuracy, arbitrariness, or inscrutability) contexts. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are breaking new ground in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation; however, we argue that inconspicuous distortions arising from complex multimodal interaction dynamics can lead to systematic bias. The purpose of this position paper is twofold: first, it is intended to acquaint AI researchers with phenomenological explainable approaches that rely on the physical entities that the machine experiences during training/inference, as opposed to the traditional cognitivist symbolic account or metaphysical approaches; second, it is to state that this phenomenological doctrine will be practically useful for tackling algorithmic fairness issues in MLLMs. We develop a surrogate physics-based model that describes transformer dynamics (i.e., semantic network structure and self-/cross-attention) to analyze the dynamics of cross-modal bias in MLLM, which are not fully captured by conventional embedding- or representation-level analyses. We support this position through multi-input diagnostic experiments: 1) perturbation-based analyses of emotion classification using Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemma 3n, and 2) dynamical analysis of Lorenz chaotic time-series prediction through the physical surrogate. Across two architecturally distinct MLLMs, we show that multimodal inputs can reinforce modality dominance rather than mitigate it, as revealed by structured error-attractor patterns under systematic label perturbation, complemented by dynamical analysis.

Abstract: Studying shape changing thick surfaces induced by differential growth helps us understand morphogenesis in biology and offers opportunities for device design. While ideal 2D differential growth maps have been well studied for both isotropic and anisotropic growth, scenarios involving gradients in thickness growth are far less explored. In this paper, we focus on a bilayer system in which the two layers undergo independent but incompatible growth. We examine how the strength of the growth patterns and the aspect ratio of the bilayer influence the resulting shapes. We first investigate the effect of global area difference in the bilayer. Next, we make one of the two layers active and program it with positive or negative, localized or uniform curvature. We then present examples involving competition between two active surfaces with opposite curvature signs or different curvature distributions and understand how the final configurations follow from the principles identified earlier. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to program biologically inspired shapes, such as dental epithelium and the ventral furrow in Drosophila, using a bilayer with simple, distinct deformation gradients.

Abstract: We introduce a system architecture that addresses a fundamental challenge in deploying language-model agents for autonomous control of scientific instrumentation: ensuring reliability in safety-critical environments. The framework integrates probabilistic reasoning by domain-specialized language models with deterministic execution layers that enforce constraints through structured validation and modular orchestration. By separating intent interpretation, experimental planning, and command verification, the architecture translates high-level scientific goals into verifiable experimental actions. We demonstrate this approach in real-time atomic-resolution scanning probe microscopy experiments operated at room temperature, where the system autonomously generates control strategies, invokes corrective modules, and maintains stable operation under experimentally challenging conditions. Quantitative evaluations show that domain-adapted small language models achieve high routing robustness and command accuracy while operating on consumer-grade hardware. Beyond a specific instrument, the framework establishes a general computational principle for deploying language-model agents in safety-critical experimental workflows, providing a pathway toward scalable autonomous laboratories.

Abstract: Tipping points are one of the hot topics in modern physics of complex systems. But what is a tipping point? A generic definition declares it as ``a state of the system where a small change in its parameters can lead to a significant change in its properties''. Additional ingredients that often enter the definition of tipping process are the abruptness of the resulting change and its irreversibility, i.e. it is impossible to recover the initial state if one reverses the protocol of change of the parameters. However, there exists a number of different mathematical structures that can show this behavior, the one that was originally suggested as a tipping point (nowadays usually referred to as bifurcation induced tipping) is just one of many. Different preconditions and/or different level of details included into the model, reflecting also different environmental forcing, can lead to a variety of tipping mechanisms. Furthermore, in a spatially extended system and/or a system with multiple scales, different parts can react to a change in environmental conditions differently or at a different time, interacting with each other to create a tipping cascade. In this paper, using ecosystems as a paradigm of complex nonlinear open systems, we provide a critical overview of the progress made in tipping point science over the last 15 years. We highlight the main findings, identify gaps in our knowledge, and outline a roadmap for further progress.

Abstract: The advancement of diverse generative deep learning models and their variants has furnished substantial insights for investigating quantum many-body problems. In this work, we design two models based on the foundational architecture of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to investigate the ground-state properties and phase transition characteristics of the two-dimensional quantum rotor model (QRM). Within a semi-supervised learning framework, we incorporate multiple layers of transposed convolutions in the generator, enabling the conditional GAN to more efficiently extract low-dimensional encoded information. Analysis of one-dimensional latent variables associated with ground-state samples for different system sizes allows us to pinpoint the location of the critical point. In addition, we introduce dynamically adaptive weighting factors related to the distributional characteristics into the loss function of the deep convolutional GAN, and utilize upsampling techniques to enlarge the generated sample sizes. Comparisons of the optimization processes for mean magnetization and potential energy density across different magnetization regimes of QRM demonstrate that our model can efficiently generate valid ground-state samples, significantly reducing computational time. Our results highlight the promising potential of generative deep learning in quantum phase transition research, especially in critical point identification and the auxiliary generation of simulation data for quantum many-body models.

Abstract: Fluids in nanopores are of importance for many engineering applications, including energy storage in supercapacitors, hydrocarbons recovery from unconventional sources, or water desalination. Thermodynamic properties of fluids confined in nanopores differ from the properties of the same fluids in bulk. Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely used for modeling thermodynamics of confined fluids. However, it is rarely used for calculations of derivative thermodynamic properties. Here we use a rather simple DFT model for argon based on the Percus-Yevick equation, and showed that with standard parametrization it fails to predict derivative properties. However, slight adjustment in parameters leads to quantitative predictions of isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient at a selected temperature. Using the adjusted parameterization we performed the calculations of compressibility of argon confined in carbon slit pores of various sizes, and demonstrated that the compressibility of argon in confinement is lower than that in bulk and is pore size dependent. We confirmed the DFT predictions using the Monte Carlo molecular simulations. In addition to isothermal compressibility, we calculated the thermal expansion coefficient of confined argon. Our calculations showed that it behaves similar to compressibility -- it is always lower than the bulk value and gradually increases for smaller pore sizes. For several selected pore sizes we verified the DFT calculations by Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, our results suggest that the classical DFT can be utilized for calculations of derivative thermodynamic properties of confined fluids, which are computationally challenging to predict using molecular simulations.

Abstract: We build an exact framework to evaluate heat, energy, and particle transport between Gaussian reservoirs mediated by a quadratic quantum system. By combining full counting statistics with newly developed non-Markovian master equation approaches, we introduce an effective master equation whose solution can be used to generate arbitrary moments of the heat statistics for any number of reservoirs. This theory applies equally to fermionic and bosonic systems, holds at arbitrarily strong coupling, and resolves out-of-equilibrium transient dynamics determined by the system's initial state. In the steady-state, weak-coupling limit, we recover results analogous to those of the well-known Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. We conclude our discussion by demonstrating an application of the method to a prototypical fermionic system. Our results uncover a regime of transient negative heat conductance contingent upon the initial system preparation, providing a clear signature of non-trivial out-of-equilibrium dynamics.

Abstract: A three-dimensionally interconnected hexagonal boron nitride (3Di-hBN) networked Cu-Ni (3Di-hBN-Cu-Ni) composite was successfully synthesized in situ using a simple two-step process which involved the compaction of mixed Cu-Ni powders (70 wt.% Cu and 30 wt.% Ni) into a disc followed by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process at 1000{\deg}C. During MOCVD, the Cu-Ni alloy grains acted as a template for the growth of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) while decaborane and ammonia were used as precursors for boron and nitrogen, respectively. Boron and nitrogen atoms diffused into the Cu-Ni solution during the MOCVD process, precipitated out and grew along the Cu-Ni interfaces upon cooling. It was demonstrated that pores were generated during the sintering process and then filled by bulk hBN during the MOCVD process (indicated by energy dispersive spectroscopy) as the pores also served as catalytic sites for the nucleation and growth of hBN. Optical microscopy examination indicated that there was a minimum amount of bulk hBN at certain compaction pressure (280 MPa) and sintering time (30 min). Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the interconnected network of hBN layers surrounding the Cu-Ni grains was developed in the 3Di-hBN-Cu-Ni composite. This 3Di-hBN network is expected to enhance the resistance of the 3Di-hBN-Cu-Ni composite against mechanical, thermal and chemical attacks. Moreover, foam-like 3Di-hBN was extracted from 3Di-hBN-Cu-Ni composite which could be further applied in the fields of biomedicine and energy storage.

Abstract: The third law of thermodynamics dictates that the entropy of materials becomes zero as temperature ($T$) approaches zero. Contrarily, glass and other similar materials exhibit nonzero entropy at $T=0$, which contradicts the third law. For over a century, it has been a common practice to evade this problem by regarding glass as nonequilibrium. However, this treatment causes many inconsistencies in thermodynamics theory. This paper provides resolutions to these inconsistencies and provides a rigorous expression of the third law without any exception. To seek the entropy origin, the anthropomorphic feature of entropy must be resolved. Because entropy can be uniquely determined only when thermodynamic coordinates (TCs) are specified, we have to know which are TCs. This requires the reconsideration of the definition of equilibrium for solids in an unambiguous way, which does not depend on the solid structure. On this basis, it is deduced that TCs of solids are the equilibrium positions of atoms. TCs comprise a thermodynamic space, on which a unique value can be assigned to the entropy. For solids, equilibrium states are specified by discrete points in the thermodynamic space, which define atom configurations. Among various atom configurations, only one is thermally activated at sufficiently low temperatures, and others are called frozen configuration, which do not contribute to the temperature dependence of entropy in that region. The rigorous statement of the third law has been established by expressing that the entropy associated with the active configuration vanishes at $T=0$. Residual entropy arises when the entropy is evaluated on an extended space including the frozen configurations, which were previously active at high temperatures. The reconciliation of the two different views is explained through several debates on the glass transition.

Abstract: Axial vectors, such as current or magnetization, are commonly used order parameters in time-reversal symmetry breaking systems. These vectors also break isotropy in three dimensional systems, lowering the spatial symmetry. We demonstrate that it is possible to construct a three-dimensional medium with average isotropy and inversion symmetry where time-reversal symmetry is systematically broken. We devise a model of an amorphous material with scalar time-reversal symmetry breaking, implemented by hopping through chiral magnetic clusters along the bonds. The presence of only average spatial symmetries -- continuous rotation and inversion -- is sufficient to protect a topological phase, yielding a statistical topological insulator. We demonstrate the topological nature of our model by constructing a bulk integer topological invariant for the effective continuum model, which guarantees gapless surface spectrum on any surface with an odd number of Dirac nodes, analogous to crystalline mirror Chern insulators. We also show the expected transport properties of a three-dimensional statistical topological insulator, which remains critical on the surface for odd values of the invariant.

Abstract: We point out that area laws of quantum-information concepts indicate limitations of block transformations as well-behaved real-space renormalization group (RG) maps, which in turn guides the design of better RG schemes. Mutual-information area laws imply the difficulty of Kadanoff's block-spin method in two dimensions (2D) or higher due to the growth of short-scale correlations among the spins on the boundary of a block. A leap to the tensor-network RG, in hindsight, follows the guidance of mutual information and is efficient in 2D, thanks to its mixture of quantum and classical perspectives and the saturation of entanglement entropy in 2D. In three dimensions (3D), however, entanglement grows according to the area law, posing a threat to 3D block-tensor map as an apt RG transformation. As a numerical evidence, we show that estimations of 3D Ising critical exponents fail to improve by retaining more couplings. As a guidance to proceed, a tensor-network toy model is proposed to capture the 3D entanglement-entropy area law.

Abstract: Collision of quantum particles remains an effective way of probing their mutual statistics. Colliders based on quantum point contacts in quantum Hall edge states have been successfully used to probe the statistics of the underlying quantum particles. Notwithstanding the extensive theoretical work focusing on point-like colliders, when it comes to experiment, the colliders are rarely point-like objects and can support a resonant level or multiple tunneling points. We present a study of a paradigmatic extended (non-point-like) fermionic collider (and an extension to bosonic colliders). As with particle interferometers, in an extended collider there is an infinite number of trajectories for any single or multi-particle event. Self-interference of the former can lead to an apparent bunching of fermions when we compare the cross-current correlator with a classical benchmark representing two colliding beams. In view of this apparent bunching behavior of fermions, we identify an experimentally accessible current correlator which reveals the true mutual statistics of fermions.

Abstract: We study how spatiotemporal chaos in dynamical systems can be controlled by stochastically returning them to their initial conditions. Focusing on discrete nonlinear maps, we analyze how key measures of chaos -- the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, which quantify sensitivity to initial perturbations and the ballistic spread of information, respectively -- are reduced by stochastic resetting. We identify a critical resetting rate that induces a dynamical phase transition, characterized by the simultaneous vanishing of the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, effectively arresting the spread of information. These theoretical predictions are validated and illustrated with numerical simulations of the celebrated logistic map and its lattice extension. Beyond discrete maps, our findings are applicable to virtually any chaotic extended classical many-body system.

Abstract: VO2 features concomitant structural and metal-insulator transitions. This poses a challenge for understanding the underlying mechanism: is the transition triggered by a structural or by an electronic instability? The two scenarios are expected to produce very different pre-transitional fluctuations above TC. By combining magnetic susceptibility, IR reflectivity and X-ray diffuse scattering measurements, we observe that metallic VO2 features strong electronic and structural fluctuations towards the insulating monoclinic phase. By measuring resonant diffuse X-ray scattering across the Vanadium K-edge, we search for a potential decoupling between electronic and structural ordering in these fluctuations, finding no evidence of it. While our results do not completely rule out pure electronic fluctuations, they constrain them, favoring the interpretation that the VO2 metal-insulator transition is triggered by a structural instability. Our work offers a novel approach to solve similar problems in other strongly correlated systems.

Abstract: We report the study of phases and transitions of SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model subject to commensurate magnetic field on the triangular lattice. At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 <= N <= 8, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from parton large-N mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U and the number of flavor N . We construct the critical theory for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid and calculate the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N . These results could be validated in synthetic systems such as moire superlattices and cold atom platforms.

Abstract: We conduct first-principles simulations of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a nickelate in which recent experiments have shown signs of high-temperature superconductivity. Within the hydrostatic pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in effective on-site repulsion in the maximally localised Wannier functions comprising the Ni $e_g$ bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase to an interplay between orbital localisation and competing screening channels arising from structural variations. Our results indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations, which show a close correspondence with the critical temperature. Including finite temperatures up to 100 K, $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics simulations then provide new insights into the debated structural phase diagram and further clarify the origin of the right-triangular superconducting dome. Finally, we study Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to confirm the crucial role of the $A$-site cation in shaping the pressure-driven evolution of electronic correlations.

Abstract: Understanding the natural bounds of entropy production for driven nonequilibrium dynamics in many-body systems reveals how the fundamentals of thermodynamics manifest in these regimes across a wide variety of systems. In this direction, we propose and study the dynamics of a thermal zero-player entropy game, the Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg), a self-driven system exhibiting characteristics of lattice gases, Ising models, and discrete games. We show that there is a universal bound on the entropy production rate, independent of temperature and lattice size. The thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and a plausible testbed for studying the fundamentals of stochastic thermodynamics.

Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It searches for the ground state of the Ising model, which corresponds to the optimal solution of a given combinatorial optimization problem. The guiding principle of quantum annealing is the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics, which guarantees that a system remains in the ground state of its Hamiltonian if the time evolution is sufficiently slow. According to the adiabatic theorem, the annealing time required for quantum annealing to satisfy the adiabaticity scales inversely proportional to the square of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state during time evolution. As a result, finding the ground state becomes significantly more difficult when the energy gap is small, creating a major bottleneck in quantum annealing. Expanding the energy gap is one strategy for improving the performance of quantum annealing; however, its implementation in actual hardware remains difficult. This study proposes a method for efficiently solving instances with small energy gaps by introducing additional local terms to the Hamiltonian and exploiting the diabatic transition remaining in the small energy gap. The proposed method achieves an approximate quadratic speedup of the exponential scaling exponent in time to solution compared to the conventional quantum annealing. In addition, we investigate the transferability of the parameters obtained with the proposed method.

Abstract: Cilia and flagella are micron-sized filaments that actively beat with remarkable precision in a viscous medium, driving microorganism movement and efficient flow. We study the rower model to uncover how cilia activity and dissipation enable this precise motion. In this model, cilia motion is represented by a micro-bead's Brownian movement between two distant harmonic potentials. At specific locations, energy pumps trigger potential switches, capturing cilia activity and generating oscillations. We quantify precision of oscillation using a quality factor, identifying its scaling with activity and oscillation amplitude, finding precision maximization at an optimal amplitude. The data collapse is not accurate for noisy oscillations. An exact analytic expression for the precision quality factor, based on first passage time fluctuations, and derived in the small noise approximation, explains its optimality and scaling. Energy budget analysis shows the quality factor's consistency with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Finally, we demonstrate that asymmetric beating reduces oscillation precision compared to the symmetric model: although the optimal amplitude remains unchanged, the overall scaling of the quality factor depends explicitly on the asymmetry parameter.

Abstract: The transport properties of nanofluidic channels are usually studied under constant (DC) voltage or pressure driving. However, the frequency response under sinusoidal (AC) drivings offers rich insights into the time-dependent transport mechanisms. Inspired by recent electrochemical approaches, we investigate the couplings between ionic and electronic transport under AC driving. We show that conduction electrons of the channel walls participate in ionic current via capacitive electrochemical coupling, defining a critical frequency and length scale where electron-dominated conductivity emerges. We further analyze how electron-ion coupling modifies electro-osmotic flows, and demonstrate that fluctuation-induced momentum transfer between the electrolyte and wall electrons produces distinct AC transport signatures depending on the charge carrier polarity. Altogether, we establish a frequency-dependent transport matrix that couples ionic, electronic and hydrodynamic flows. These findings establish AC nanofluidic transport as a powerful probe of interfacial phenomena under confinement, and suggest new directions for engineering nanofluidic functionalities through electron-electrolyte coupling.

Abstract: We present a self-consistent theory to calculate the static and uniform spin susceptibility in superconductors under simultaneous Zeeman magnetic fields and Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Employing a single-band Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian, we solve the gap equation for both conventional $s$-wave spin-singlet and six representative $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing states, categorized into opposite-spin-pairing (OSP) and equal-spin-pairing (ESP) classes. The Kubo formula, decomposed into intra- and interband particle-hole and particle-particle channels, provides two key constraints: at zero temperature, only particle-particle terms contribute, while at the critical temperature $T_c$, only particle-hole terms remain, ensuring $\chi(T_c^{-}) = \chi_N$ for continuous phase transitions. For $s$-wave pairing, a Zeeman field reduces $T_c$, whereas Rashba SOC preserves $T_c$ but yields a residual zero temperature spin susceptibility $\chi(0)$ which approaches $2\chi_N/3$ in the strong SOC limit; combined fields create a Bogoliubov Fermi surface, resulting in a kink in $\chi(0)$. In contrast, $p$-wave states exhibit strong anisotropy: OSP states mimic spin-singlet pairing behavior for parallel Zeeman fields and ESP for transverse ones, while ESP states show the opposite, with Rashba SOC potentially changing the quasiparticle nodal structure, lowering $T_c$, or causing $\chi_{zz}(0)$ divergences. This framework offers quantitative benchmarks for Knight-shift experiments in non-centrosymmetric superconductors like A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = Na, K, Rb, and Cs), enabling diagnostics to disentangle pairing symmetry, SOC strength, and Zeeman effects.

Abstract: Quenched disorder in absorbing phase transitions can disrupt the structure and symmetry of reaction-diffusion processes, offering a more accurate mapping to real physical systems. We developed a temporally quenched disorder method in the (1+1)-dimensional direct percolation (DP) model, where the increment of conditional probability is determined by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the L\'evy distribution. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations reveal that the model has a critical region governing the transition between absorbing and active states, and this region changes as the parameter $\beta$, which influences distribution properties. Guided by dynamic scaling laws, we observe that significant variations in the L\'evy distribution parameter $\beta$ lead to notable changes in the particle density decay exponent $\alpha$, total particle number exponent $\theta$, and spreading exponent $\tilde{z}$. The quenching mechanism we introduced has broad potential applications in various theoretical and experimental studies of absorbing phase transitions.

Abstract: Solid-state dewetting is the process by which thin solid films break up and retract on a substrate, forming nanostructures. While dewetting of single-crystalline films is understood as a surface-energy-driven process mediated by surface diffusion, polycrystalline films exhibit additional complexity due to the presence of grain boundaries. Most theoretical and computational studies have focused on single-crystalline dewetting. Here, we present the application of the grandpotential multi-phase-field model to the dewetting of thin polycrystalline films in three dimensions, reproducing the key phenomenology of this process. By considering isotropic interface/surface energy, we illustrate its consistency with predictions based on energetic arguments and the morphological evolution towards equilibrium. We also provide novel analytical criteria for the onset of three-dimensional dewetting, serving as fundamental theoretical benchmarks, and highlight the critical role of triple junctions. Moreover, we unveil the dewetting behavior of polycrystalline patches, extending the scenarios of their single-crystalline counterparts.

arXiv:2507.19429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disconnections, long recognized as the key mediators of grain boundary (GB) kinetics in polycrystalline materials, have traditionally been understood to nucleate through thermal or mechanical activation. In this work, using atomistic simulations, we reveal a distinct nucleation mechanism driven exclusively by solute interstitial segregation across multiple substitutional binary alloy systems (e.g., Al-Ni, Al-Fe). This process exhibits zero-nucleation energy barriers, contrasting sharply with the nucleation mechanisms in pure systems. We identify states that are activated through segregation-induced GB phase transitions: (i) isolated disconnections or phase junctions that promote GB migration and disappear with continuous segregation, and (ii) composite disconnections that are formed via two oppositely oriented isolated disconnections. The disconnections are mechanically robust, suppressing shear-coupled migration and instead resulting in GB amorphization and pure sliding under applied shear loading. The long-range stress fields associated with these composite disconnections further attract solute atoms and assist the nucleation of precipitates. These disconnections, absent in pure materials, follow unique nucleation pathways as confirmed through dichromatic pattern analysis and persist across different alloy chemistries and crystal structures. Our findings demonstrate that solute interstitial segregation provides a powerful and previously unrecognized pathway for barrier-free disconnection formation, thereby fundamentally extending current understanding of GB kinetics in alloy systems.

Abstract: We study the interplay between strong correlations and Markovian dephasing, resulting from monitoring the charge or spin degrees of freedom of a quantum dot described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model. Using the Auxiliary master equation approach we compute the steady-state spectral function and occupation of the dot and discuss the role of dephasing on Kondo physics. Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations. Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.

Abstract: Strain-engineered transition-metal dichalcogenide nanobubbles are promising platforms for quantum emission, as revealed by recent experimental observations. In this work, we present an \textit{ab initio} investigation of MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$ nanobubbles, linking their structural and electronic properties to predictions of their optical activity. Inflating forces yield tunable geometries with non-uniform, apex-concentrated strain, which is sensitive to material rigidity. Strain modifies band gaps and universally induces non-dispersive valence states, exhibiting composition-dependent wave-function character, as revealed by an in-depth analysis of band structures and orbital contributions. Crucially, transitions from these apex-localized valence states are predominantly dark. This characteristic is attributed to their localization at the $\Gamma$-point, inhibiting transitions to the lowest unoccupied states that reside at the K-valley. While revealing that the herein considered sub-10-nm nanobubbles fall short as single-photon emitters, our findings provide essential understanding of the structure-property relations in emerging quantum materials, providing robust design rules to optimize their characteristics for novel quantum applications.

Abstract: Sensitive detection of low-abundance molecular targets is widely assumed to require enzymatic amplification, such as PCR, to achieve low detection limits. In amplification-free platforms, sensitivity is traditionally constrained by equilibrium binding affinity. Here we show that multivalent linker entropy provides a distinct physical route to exponential sensitivity enhancement in purely equilibrium sensing architectures. Using a statistical-mechanical theory supported by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that redistributing a fixed total interaction strength over increasing linker valency exponentially lowers adsorption thresholds. This scaling emerges not from stronger energetic affinity, but from the rapid growth of combinatorial binding configurations, revealing entropy as an intrinsic amplification mechanism. Consequently, detection limits can be tuned independently of bond strength, enabling ultrasensitive responses without enzymatic replication. Our results establish a general physical design principle for engineering amplification-free detection systems capable of approaching PCR-level sensitivities through entropy-driven collective effects.

Abstract: Moir\'e flat bands in rhombohedral multilayer graphene provide a platform for exploring interaction-driven topological phases, where a single isolated band often forms a Chern band. However, non-Abelian degenerate Chern bands with internal symmetries such as $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ have so far been realized only in highly engineered systems. Here, we show that a doubly degenerate non-Abelian Chern band with Chern number $|C|=1$ emerges spontaneously at filling $\nu=2$ in rhombohedral 3-, 4-, and 5-layer graphene, regardless of the presence of an hBN substrate. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we map out phase diagrams as functions of displacement field and electronic periodicity, and analytically demonstrate that the Fock term drives spontaneous symmetry breaking and generates non-Abelian Berry curvature. We further show that this non-Abelian topology is characterized by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge flux threading the noncontractible cycles of the Brillouin zone, leading to a global non-Abelian holonomy. Our findings unveil a new class of interaction-driven non-Abelian topological phases, distinct from quantum anomalous Hall and fractional Chern phases.

Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the QED$_3$. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.

Abstract: Near-field hydrodynamic interactions between bacteria and no-slip solid surfaces are the main mechanism underlying surface entrapment of bacteria. In this study, we employ a chiral two-body model to simulate bacterial dynamics near the surface. The simulation results show that as bacteria approach the surface, their translational velocities and diffusion coefficients decrease. Under the combination of near-field hydrodynamic interactions and DLVO forces, bacteria reach a stable fixed point in the phase plane and follow circular trajectories at this point. In particular, bacteria with left-handed helical flagella exhibit clockwise circular motion on the surface. During this process, as the stable height increases, the near-field hydrodynamic interactions weaken. Consequently, the translational velocity of the bacteria parallel to the surface increases while the rotational velocity perpendicular to the surface decreases, collectively increasing the radius of curvature. Ultimately, our findings demonstrate that near-field hydrodynamic interactions significantly prolong the surface residence time of bacteria. Additionally, smaller stable heights further amplify this effect, resulting in longer residence times and enhanced surface entrapment.

Abstract: We present an effective description for the crystal structures of pnictogen elemental solids. In these materials, each atom contains three valence electrons in $p$ orbitals. They are shared between neighbouring atoms to form valence bonds. We propose a trivalent network model on the simple cubic lattice. As a generalization of a dimer model, we impose a constraint that three dimers must touch every site. We argue that intra-orbital Coulomb repulsion prohibits the formation of two adjacent, parallel dimers. This leads to a tripod-like local configuration at every site. More importantly, it forces every line of the cubic lattice to have alternating dimers and blanks. There is no dynamics as dimers cannot be locally rearranged. A bulk-boundary mapping emerges whereby bonds in the interior are fully described by Ising variables on three bounding planes -- a simple example of holography that may be realized in real materials. To describe the energetics of bonding, we formulate a minimal model in terms of boundary Ising spins. Symmetries reduce the problem to that of three identical, independent, two-dimensional Ising models. An antiferromagnetic Ising-ground-state corresponds to the A7 structure seen in antimony and grey arsenic. An antiferromagnetic phase within a bilayer describes the structure of phosphorene. By stacking such bilayers, we obtain the A17 structure of black phosphorus. The stripe phase of the Ising models describes the cubic gauche structure of nitrogen. As a testable signature, we demonstrate that single impurities will induce long-ranged domain walls.

Fei Liu, Jiayin Gu

arXiv:2509.26123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two methods for computing the large deviations of the first-passage-time statistics in general open quantum systems. The first method determines the region of convergence of the joint Laplace transform and the $z$-transform of the first-passage time distribution by solving an equation of poles with respect to the $z$-transform parameter. The scaled cumulant generating function is then obtained as the logarithm of the boundary values within this region. The theoretical basis lies in the facts that the dynamics of the open quantum systems can be unraveled into a piecewise deterministic process and there exists a tilted Liouville master equation in Hilbert space. The second method uses a simulation-based approach built on the wave function cloning algorithm. To validate both methods, we derive analytical expressions for the scaled cumulant generating functions in field-driven two-level and three-level systems. In addition, we present numerical results alongside cloning simulations for a field-driven system comprising two interacting two-level atoms.

Abstract: The origin of the charge density wave (CDW) phase in TiSe$_2$ is a highly debated topic, with lattice and excitonic correlations proposed as the main driving mechanisms. One of the proposed scenarios is the excitonic insulator (EI) mechanism, where soft electronic mode drives the phase transition. However, the existence of this purely electronic mode is controversial. Here, we perform fully ab-initio calculations of the electron excitation spectra in TiSe$_2$ with electron-hole excitonic effects included via Bethe-Salpeter equations. In the normal high-temperature phase the excitation spectra is dominated by the exciton mode at 1.6 eV, while no well-defined soft electronic modes that could support the EI phase are present. In the CDW phase, the structural distortions induce a CDW band-gap opening between Ti-$d$ and Se-$p$ states, which supports the formation of the two low-energy excitonic modes in the optical spectrum at 0.4 eV and 80 meV. Close to the transition temperature $T_{\rm CDW}$, these two excitonic modes are softened and approach zero energy. These results suggest that the EI mechanism is not a main driving force in the formation of the CDW phase in TiSe$_2$, but there is a region in the phase diagram near $T_{\rm CDW}$ where EI fluctuations could be relevant.

Abstract: The dynamics of extended many-body systems are generically chaotic. Classically, a hallmark of chaos is the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions captured by positive Lyapunov exponents. Supplementing chaotic dynamics with stochastic resetting drives a sharp dynamical phase transition: We show that the Lyapunov spectrum, i.e., the complete set of Lyapunov exponents, abruptly collapses to zero above a critical resetting rate. At criticality, we find a sudden loss of analyticity of the velocity-dependent Lyapunov exponent, which we relate to the transition from ballistic scrambling of information to an arrested regime where information becomes exponentially localized over a characteristic length diverging at criticality with an exponent $\nu = 1/2$ and a dynamical exponent $z=2$. We illustrate our analytical results on generic chaotic dynamics by numerical simulations of coupled map lattices.

Abstract: Altermagnets hold great potential for spintronic applications, yet their intrinsic spin dynamics and associated transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate spin-resolved quantum transport in a multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet. It is found that the altermagnetic spin splitting in momentum space induces an interesting spin precession in two-dimensional real space, giving rise to characteristic spin patterns. This altermagnetic spin precession manifests as a spatial modulation of the transverse Hall-like voltage, whose oscillation period provides a direct measure of the spin-splitting strength. When the altermagnetism is electrically tunable, the proposed setup functions as a prototype for a highly efficient spin transistor. The key physical effects are shown to be robust against dephasing and crystalline warping. Our work not only identifies a fingerprint signature of altermagnets, offering a direct probe of the altermagnetic spin splitting, but also represents an important step toward bridging their fundamental physics with practical spintronic applications.

Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless quantum matter stems from low-energy descriptions using conformal field theory. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the underlying quantum geometry by considering finite many-body systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that probe the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. The former is less sensitive to decoherence than the latter, so it can provide robust experimental signatures of our predictions. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the emergent effective description. This is supported both by numerical simulations of gapless lattice models, and by exact results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, probing the full dynamical parameter space.

Despite its structural features, infrared reflectivity and electronic transport measurements along the $a$ and $c$ crystallographic axes show metallic behavior without evidence of reduced dimensionality. Optical conductivity reveals an anisotropic but conventional metallic response with low scattering rates and a single sharp infrared-active phonon mode at $396$ cm$^{-1}$ ($49$ meV). Ab initio calculations closely match the experimental optical data and confirm a three-dimensional electronic structure. Our results demonstrate that TaNiTe$_5$ behaves as a three-dimensional anisotropic semimetal in its electronic and optical properties.

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, characterized by the coexistence of atypical non-thermal eigenstates within an otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum. In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom. Our results illustrate the power and interplay of interference-based and algebraic mechanisms of non-ergodicity, offering systematic routes to identifying and classifying QMBS in generic many-body quantum systems.

Abstract: We investigate the interaction-driven reorganization of spin and charge correlations in finite Hubbard clusters using exact diagonalization. Focusing on half-filled and lightly doped square lattices, we analyze spin-resolved charge-gaps, local observables, two-point correlation functions, entanglement measures, principal component analysis (PCA) of correlation matrices and quantum-geometry-based distance metrics. At half-filling, we observe the emergence of a robust Mott gap whose spin-dependent component is controlled by the effective exchange energy scale J~4t^2/U at strong coupling, confirming that residual spin dynamics govern the separation between the lowest-spin and the next higher-spin charge excitation channels. Distinct cluster geometries and boundary conditions reveal how spin-singlet versus finite-spin ground-state influence charge and spin responses. Upon one-hole doping, the spin-resolved charge-gaps collapses, indicating restored compressibility and metallic behavior. PCA and quantum-geometry-based analysis provide complementary data-driven and wavefunction-based perspectives on correlation-driven Mott crossover phenomena. Our results demonstrate that finite-size Hubbard clusters exhibit clear signatures of the Mott physics, spin-charge interplay and emergent exchange energy scales, offering a unified microscopic picture of interaction-induced electronic reorganization.

Abstract: We study a stochastic version of the one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation (DNSE), which is derived from first principles, and thus possesses all the properties required by statistical mechanics, such as detailed balance and the H-theorem. The stochastic version shows disordered and localised dynamics, and displays a corresponding phase transition at a finite temperature value. The phase transition can be captured in a quantitative way by a mean-field type approach. The corresponding coarsening dynamics shows an unexpected dependence on the noise strength, which is reminiscent of stochastic resonance. The phase transition is linked with negative temperature phase transitions, which have been reported recently for the Hamiltonian dynamics of the DNSE. Our approach gives a clue to how these negative temperature phase transitions can be implemented in experimental setups, which are inevitably coupled to a positive temperature heat bath.

Abstract: Seniority is a useful way of organizing Hilbert space for strongly correlated systems. The exact zero-seniority wave function, doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI), provides accurate results (given the right orbitals) for many strongly correlated electronic systems but has a combinatorial computational cost. In many cases, pair coupled cluster doubles provides a polynomial-cost approximation that closely reproduces the energies of DOCI, but it breaks down in some cases and, as shown herein, it does not provide particularly good density matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that by using the Jordan-Wigner transformation to turn the seniority zero problem back into a fermionic one, we can provide mean-field variational results of DOCI quality for the Hubbard model and a few small molecular dissociation examples, with polynomial cost, both for the energies and for density matrices, all while being protected from collapse. This success is rooted in the proof we provide showing that the Hartree-Fock wave function on the Jordan-Wigner--transformed Hamiltonian transforms back to variational coupled cluster doubles in the seniority zero representation, but restricted to have determinant rather than permanent amplitude coefficients, without compromising its overall accuracy.

Abstract: We develop a kinetic-theory framework to investigate the steady rheology of a dilute gas interacting via a repulsive potential under uniform shear flow. Starting from the Boltzmann equation with a restitution coefficient that depends on the impact velocity and potential strength, we derive evolution equations for the stress tensor based on Grad's moment expansion. The resulting expressions for the collisional rates and transport coefficients are fitted with simple analytical functions that capture their temperature dependence over a wide range of shear rates. Comparison with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results shows excellent quantitative agreement for the shear stress, temperature anisotropy, and shear viscosity. We also analyze the velocity distribution functions, revealing that the system remains nearly Maxwellian even under strong shear.

Abstract: We construct asymptotic quantum many-body scars (AQMBS) in one-dimensional SU($N$) Hubbard chains ($N\geq 3$) by embedding the scar subspace into an auxiliary Hilbert subspace $\mathcal{H}_P$ and identifying a parent Hamiltonian within it, together with a corresponding extension of the restricted spectrum-generating algebra to the multi-ladder case. Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems.

Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are attractive for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to improved safety and stability but their low room-temperature ionic conductivity hinders practical application. Experimental synthesis and testing of new SSEs remain time-consuming and resource intensive. Machine learning (ML) offers an accelerated route for SSE discovery; however, composition-only models neglect structural factors important for ion transport while graph neural networks (GNNs) are challenged by the scarcity of structure-labeled conductivity data and the prevalence of crystallographic disorder in CIFs. Here, we train two complementary predictors on the same room-temperature, structure-labeled dataset (n = 499). A gradient-boosted tree regressor (GBR) combining stoichiometric and geometric descriptors achieves best performance (MAE = 0.543 in log(S cm-1)), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identifies probe-occupiable volume (POAV) and lattice parameters as key correlations for conductivity. In parallel, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using compact text prompts derived from CIF metadata (formula with optional symmetry and disorder tags), avoiding direct use of raw atomic coordinates. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct achieves high accuracy (MAE = 0.657 in log(S cm-1)) using formula and symmetry information, eliminating the need for numerical feature extraction from CIF files. Together, these results show that global geometric descriptors improve tree-based predictions and enable interpretable structure-property analysis, while LLMs provide a competitive low-preprocessing alternative for rapid SSE screening.

Abstract: We show that recent numerical findings of universal scaling relations in systems of noisy, aligning self-propelled particles by K\"ursten [K\"ursten, arXiv:2402.18711v2 [cond-mat.soft] (2025)] can robustly be explained by perturbation theory and known results for the Mathieu equation with purely imaginary parameter. In particular, we highlight the significance of a cascade of exceptional points that leads to non-trivial fractional scaling exponents in the singular-perturbation limit of high activity. Crucially, these features are rooted in the Fokker-Planck operator corresponding to free self-propulsion. This can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition in the dynamics of noisy active matter. We also predict that these scaling relations depend on the symmetry of the alignment interactions and discuss the relevance of this structure in the free propagation for self-alignment and cohesion-type interactions.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of the $T$-linear specific heat in pressurized and magnetized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, we perform the state-of-the-art thermal tensor-network computation on the Shastry-Sutherland model under a magnetic field. Our simulation results suggest the existence of a symmetric intermediate phase with $T$-linear specific heat at low temperature, occupying a large parameter space and between the plaquette-singlet phase and antiferromagnetic phase at low fields and other symmetry-breaking phases at high fields before the system is fully polarized. Such an unexpected novel state bears an astonishing similarity to the experimental findings in the material. It opens the door to further investigations of the possible liberation of deconfined magnetized Dirac spinons by the competing interactions in this highly frustrated quantum magnet model, and by the combined effects of magnetic field and pressure in the associated Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.

Abstract: Topological boundary modes, a hallmark of quantum topological phases, remarkably occur in classical mechanical systems through an interesting correspondence with the quantum case. Here, we explore the Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators and argue that the combination of the intrinsic spin-lattice coupling and the spin exchanges could induce the topological mechanics with topological boundary floppy modes in the phonon spectra. This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagom\'e lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes. We expect this work to inspire interests in the Maxwell lattice Mott insulating materials and the coupling between lattices and electronic orders.

Abstract: Understanding vortex matter in type-II superconductors is central to controlling dissipation and flux pinning in superconducting materials and devices. Here, we use cryogenic scanning nitrogen vacancy magnetometry (NVM) to image Abrikosov vortices in the cuprate superconductors BSCCO-2212 and YBCO under controlled field-cooled conditions. Measurements, which are performed using continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cw-ODMR) in a closed-cycle cryostat, yield quantitative magnetic-field maps with nanoscale spatial resolution. In BSCCO-2212 at 71 K, we resolve a well-ordered triangular vortex lattice, whose symmetry and spacing are confirmed through 2D Fourier analysis and are consistent with flux quantization. YBCO thin films imaged at 3 K exhibit a more disordered vortex arrangement reflecting stronger pinning, while maintaining quantitative agreement between measured vortex density and the applied magnetic field. These results render our cryogenic scanning NVM a reliable quantitative tool for real-space studies of vortices in high-$T_c$ superconductors, in particular since such a remarkable magnetic resolution has been achieved within relatively short acquisition times of 2 to 4 h.

Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_2$) has been proposed as a prototypical metallic $d$-wave altermagnet, a N\'eel-ordered compensated antiferromagnetic state exhibiting nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting; yet, its magnetic ground state remains controversial both theoretically and experimentally. Using comprehensive first-principles calculations, we investigate RuO$_2$ thin films with (110), (100), and (001) orientations, both (un)strained freestanding and supported on a TiO$_2$ substrate. We show that emergent magnetic moments in RuO$_2$ thin films are highly fragile, strongly influenced by strain, surface orientation, and atomic relaxation, while also being highly sensitive to the choice of the Brillouin-zone integration scheme. We find that none of the thin film structures considered can stabilize a compensated antiferromagnetic order; therefore, an altermagnetic ground state cannot be realized. Instead, substrate-supported RuO$_2$ films on TiO$_2$ exhibit pronounced layer- and site-dependent magnetic moment variations and incomplete compensation between the two antiferromagnetically coupled Ru moments, yielding a \emph{ferrimagnetic-like} behavior. On the other hand, freestanding RuO$_2$ films display complex magnetic structures depending on their orientation and applied strain, with distinct behavior at the surfaces and in the inner layers. Our results reconcile conflicting theoretical and experimental reports and underscore the sensitivity of RuO$_2$ magnetism to structural and methodological details.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence can rapidly propose candidate phases and structures from X-ray diffraction (XRD), but these hypotheses often fail in downstream refinement because peak intensities cannot be stably assigned under severe overlap and diffraction consistency is enforced only weakly. Here we introduce the whole-pattern expectation--maximization (WPEM) algorithm, a physics-constrained whole-pattern decomposition and refinement workflow that turns Bragg's law into an explicit constraint within a batch expectation--maximization framework. WPEM models the full profile as a probabilistic mixture density and iteratively infers component-resolved intensities while keeping peak centres Bragg-consistent, producing a continuous, physically admissible intensity representation that remains stable in heavily overlapped regions and in the presence of mixed radiation or multiple phases. We benchmark WPEM on standard reference patterns (PbSO$_4$ and Tb$_2$BaCoO$_5$), where it yields lower $R_p/R_{wp}$ than widely used packages (FullProf and TOPAS) under matched refinement conditions. We further demonstrate generality across realistic experimental scenarios, including phase-resolved decomposition in multiphase materials, quantitative recovery of mixture compositions, separation of crystalline peaks from amorphous backgrounds in semicrystalline systems, high-throughput operando lattice tracking, automated refinement of compositionally disordered solid solutions, and quantitative phase-resolved analysis of complex archaeological samples from synchrotron powder XRD. By providing Bragg-consistent, uncertainty-aware intensity partitioning as a refinement-ready interface, WPEM closes the gap between AI-generated hypotheses and diffraction-admissible structure refinement on challenging XRD data.

Abstract: Topology in quantum systems is typically considered in infinite crystals in one, two, or higher integer dimensions. Here, we show that one can continuously transform a system between a topological phase associated with one dimension and a topological phase associated with two dimensions without closing the energy gap. In this process, the dimension of the system itself changes. Concretely, we investigate a modified version of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and develop a procedure to smoothly shrink the width of the system in one direction. By tracking gaps which remain open throughout the modulation, we establish a smooth transition from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional topological insulator. In between the system exhibits both one- and two-dimensional topology, and the way the system accomplishes the transition is by making the one-dimensional topology more robust as the width decreases, while the two-dimensional topology becomes less robust. Finally, we show how the gaps arise from hybridization of edge states due to the finite width.

Abstract: Ab initio auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is a systematically improvable many-body method, but its application to extended solids has been severely limited by unfavorable computational scaling and memory requirements that obstruct direct access to the thermodynamic and complete-basis-set limits. By combining tensor hypercontraction with $\mathbf{k}$-point symmetry, we reduce the computational and memory scaling of ab initio AFQMC for solids to $\mathcal O(N^3)$ and $\mathcal O(N^2)$, respectively, with an arbitrary basis, comparable to diffusion Monte Carlo. This enables direct and simultaneous thermodynamic-limit and complete-basis-set AFQMC calculations across insulating, metallic, and strongly correlated solids, without embedding, local approximations, empirical finite-size corrections, or composite schemes. Our results establish AFQMC as a general-purpose, systematically improvable alternative to diffusion Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster methods for predictive ab initio simulations of solids, enabling accurate energies and magnetic observables within a unified framework.

Abstract: Copolymerization is a powerful tool to tune polymers' glass formation behavior in order to improve properties such as ion conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical response. Classically, mixing rules such as the Fox equation and its variants have been employed to predict and explain glass transition temperature (Tg) variations with copolymer composition. However, a large number of copolymers exhibit significant excursions from these mixing rules. Increasingly, it also appears that these excursions can be tuned by copolymer sequence - an effect that is not predicted by classical mixing rules and thus far remains poorly understood. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to probe the interplay between copolymer sequence, liquid-liquid phase equilibria, and Tg. We find that the direction of Tg shifts, and their dependence on sequence, are predicted by the type of liquid-liquid phase boundary towards which the comonomers tend. Monomers tending towards Upper Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit Tg reductions that become stronger with increasing monomer alternation; monomers tending towards Lower Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit Tg enhancements that become stronger with increasing monomer alternation. This behavior fundamentally emerges from a forced mixing phenomenon wherein monomer alternation induces close contact between monomer types that would otherwise tend towards phase separation. These results point towards strategies for rationally varying copolymer Tg, at fixed chemical composition, via judicious design of polymer chain sequence.

Abstract: High-fidelity quantum gates are crucial for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing; however, decoherence significantly reduces gate fidelities during long operation times. Although optimal control techniques can theoretically minimize these operation times, they often neglect realistic uncertainties in system parameters. In this work, we demonstrate that by using robust optimal control strategies, the cross-resonance gate in superconducting systems can be operated within 64 ns, achieving fidelities of F > 0.99 while maintaining robustness against up to 10% uncertainty in a single parameter. Alternatively, by extending the control time to 71 ns, we achieve fidelities of F > 0.999 with robustness against up to 3% uncertainty. Our results identify the minimal control times attainable with experimentally feasible pulses and system parameters, as well as the maximum allowable static parameter error for high-fidelity operations. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous robustness against both static and time-dependent errors by generating 100 ns control pulses (F > 0.99) that maintain robustness against 10% static parameter error and time-dependent parameter fluctuations two orders of magnitude stronger than typical experimental noise. These findings demonstrate a viable open-loop strategy for implementing fast, high-fidelity quantum gates in the presence of realistic system uncertainties that would otherwise degrade conventional control pulses.

Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model on a cylinder, focusing on the Shannon-Renyi entropy in the limit of Renyi order $n = \infty$. This entropy, calculated from the ground state amplitudes of the equivalent XXZ spin-1/2 chain, allows us to determine the Renyi entanglement entropy of the corresponding Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions, which describe the ground states of certain conformal quantum critical points. Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point. Our findings highlight the crucial role of system size parity in determining the entanglement properties of this model and offer insights into the interplay between geometry, frustration, and criticality.

Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks under gradient flow that quantifies when pretraining on a source task improves generalization on a target task. We analyze both (i) fine-tuning, when the downstream predictor is trained on top of source-induced features and (ii) a jointly rich setting, where both pretraining and downstream tasks can operate in a feature learning regime, but the downstream model is initialized with the features obtained after pre-training. In this setup, the summary statistics of randomly initialized networks after a rich pre-training are adaptive kernels which depend on both source data and labels. For (i), we analyze the performance of a readout for different pretraining data regimes. For (ii), the summary statistics after learning the target task are still adaptive kernels with features from both source and target tasks. We test our theory on linear and polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory allows interpretable conclusions on performance, which depend on the amount of data on both tasks, the alignment between tasks, and the feature learning strength.

Abstract: In crowded environments, individuals must navigate around other occupants to reach their destinations. Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these spaces is relevant for coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure for dense populations. Here, we use simulations, theory, and experiments to study how adding stochasticity to agent motion can reduce traffic jams and help agents travel more quickly to prescribed goals. A computational approach reveals the collective behavior. Above a critical noise level, large jams do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the swarm's goal attainment rate, which allows us to solve for the agent density and noise level that maximize the goals reached. Robotic experiments corroborate the behaviors observed in our simulated and theoretical results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally efficient than a planner, motivating further research into robust, decentralized navigation methods for crowded environments. By integrating ideas from physics and engineering using simulations, theory, and experiments, our work identifies new directions for emergent traffic research.

Abstract: Multiscale simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems, yet particle-based simulations become prohibitively expensive at time and length scales beyond the molecular level. Field-theoretic simulations offer an attractive alternative, but most existing formulations rely on top-down approximations and are not systematically connected to atomistic interactions. Here, we present a hierarchical bottom-up framework for constructing auxiliary field representations of molecular liquids directly from microscopic models. We introduce a hierarchical coarse-graining framework that constructs field-theoretic models directly from atomistic liquids. The method first maps atomistic interactions to coarse-grained center-of-mass potentials and regularizes short-range divergences through a perturbative expansion in reciprocal space. Building on the auxiliary field formulation developed in polymer field-theoretic simulations, we then generalize the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to arbitrary pair potentials by separating positive and negative Fourier modes and introducing two auxiliary fields. The resulting generalized mode theory extends bottom-up field-theoretic modeling beyond positive-definite kernels and is compatible with existing field-theoretic sampling strategies. By combining formal derivations with numerical regularization and mode-truncation procedures, this work provides the theoretical foundation for scalable, bottom-up field-theoretic simulations of molecular systems.

Abstract: A quantum error-correcting code with a nonzero error threshold undergoes a mixed-state phase transition when the error rate reaches that threshold. We explore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the logical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert space. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a function of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates, this spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of different weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight errors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well described by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an explicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes saturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random $\textit{stabilizer}$ codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical errors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible until a much higher $\textit{detection}$ threshold. Postselection can in principle be implemented by projecting onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, which remain correctable past the hashing bound.

Abstract: In quantum optics and condensed matter physics non-Hermitian phenomena are often studied under the assumption of an open physical system. However, there are examples of intrinsically non-Hermitian, though often $\mathcal{PT}$ (parity-time) symmetric, not necessarily open systems, in which case the concept of gain and loss relative to an underlying environment is not primordial. A particularly intriguing example with experimental consequences in the literature is QCD at finite density. Motivated by the existence of such inherently non-Hermitian systems, here we study the critical behavior of a $U(1)$-invariant Lagrangian perturbed by a complex, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric $Z_{4}$ anisotropy. We find real critical exponents both in the region of unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. In the former the coupling constants for fixed points or lines are real, whereas in the latter they become complex. Importantly, the most stable fixed point corresponds to the flow at large distances towards an effectively Hermitian $U(1)$ symmetric system. This constitutes an example where both the $U(1)$ and the Hermitian character are emergent features of the theory. This tells us about the importance and physical meaning of some non-Hermitian systems beyond interpretations involving gain and loss.

Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and are often history dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization histories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimensional projection defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using a gradient-enhanced Gaussian Process with the inverse multiquadric kernel, whose posterior variance contours delineate data-supported regions from extrapolated ones. A rotated coordinate frame decomposes the RMSD plane into reaction progress and orthogonal distance. We show the utility of the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, where a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements, along with the ratification of the visualization for more complex reactions, a Grignard rearrangement, and a conrotatory bicyclobutane ring opening.

Abstract: Phase-field simulations are a practical but also expensive tool to calculate microstructural evolution. This work aims to compare explicit time integrators for a broad class of phase-field models involving coupling between the phase-field and concentration. Particular integrators are adapted to constraints on the phase-field as well as storage scheme implications. Reproducible benchmarks are defined with a focus on having exact sharp interface solutions, allowing for identification of dominant error terms. Speedups of 4 to 114 over the classic forward Euler integrator are achievable while still using a fully explicit scheme without appreciable accuracy loss. Application examples include final stage sintering with pores slowing down grain growth as they move and merge over time.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian degeneracies of Lindblad generators (Liouvillian exceptional points) can induce non-exponential relaxation and higher-order poles in dynamical response functions. A collective spin coupled to a polarized Markovian bath exhibits an \emph{exceptional spectral phase} in which defective Liouvillian modes imprint super-Lorentzian features in frequency-resolved spectra. We compute the emission spectrum via the Liouvillian resolvent, identify symmetry-sector selection rules, and demonstrate that exceptional-point signatures are strongly state-dependent: they are suppressed in steady-state fluorescence yet become unambiguous for generic (infinite-temperature or random) initial states. Our results provide an experimentally accessible spectroscopic diagnostic of many-body Liouvillian exceptional phases and clarify when steady-state emission can (and cannot) reveal them.

Abstract: Visualizing the spatial profile of light beams is essential for evaluating irradiance, characterizing beam quality, and achieving precise alignment. In the optical spectral range, this is readily performed using silicon-based CCD and CMOS cameras. In the terahertz (THz) range, however, it typically requires specialized detectors with prohibitive costs. Here, we show that an infrared (IR) camera can be used outside of its labeled specifications to achieve similar performance as a dedicated microbolometric THz camera, at under 1% of the THz camera's cost. We compared the cameras by characterizing THz beam profiles from two sources: a pulsed broadband THz beam produced through optical rectification in organic crystals, and a narrowband quasi-continuous-wave (quasi-CW) THz beam emitted by a quantum cascade laser. For the broadband THz radiation, the beam width measured by the two cameras differed by only ~ 6%, well within the pixel resolution limit, and in the narrowband quasi-CW case by just ~ 1.3%. Additionally, both cameras show linear responsivity over a comparable irradiance range. These results expand the applicability of conventional IR cameras to the THz range, suggesting that they will become routine tools for high-fidelity THz beam diagnostics and imaging in scientific and industrial applications.
