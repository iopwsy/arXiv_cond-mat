Abstract: Confinement of fractionalized excitations can strongly restructure many-body spectra. We investigate this phenomenon in the gapped spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a staggered field, where spinons bind into domain-wall ``mesons'' deep in the antiferromagnetic phase. We present evidence that this non-integrable model exhibits both Hilbert space fractionalization and quantum scar formation as controlled by the anisotropy parameter $\Delta$. Exact diagonalization across symmetry-resolved sectors reveals a crossover from Gaussian-orthogonal (chaotic) level statistics at weak anisotropy $\Delta \sim 1$ to non-ergodic behavior deep in the antiferromagnetic regime $\Delta\gg 1$ through scrutinizing the adjacent gap ratios, accompanied by a striking banding of eigenstates by domain-wall number in correlation and entanglement measures. The Page-like entanglement dome characteristic of chaotic spectra gives way to suppressed, band-resolved entanglement consistent with emergent quasi-conservation of domain walls. To investigate further the formation mechanism of mesonic scar states, we carry out meson spectroscopy near the two-spinon threshold and compare with the analytic ladder predicted by Rutkevich [Phys. Rev. B 106, 134405 (2022)]. We test the theory through continuum-relative bindings, an offset-removed Airy scaling collapse, and explicit two-meson thresholds that determine the number of stable meson levels. The low-lying spectrum shows close quantitative agreement, while deviations at higher energies are consistent with finite-size and subleading corrections. These results establish a unified account of confinement-induced nonergodicity and provide a template for quantitative meson spectroscopy in quantum spin chains.

Abstract: We study the rheology of dense granular materials subjected to vertical vibration using numerical simulations of a stress-imposed vane rheometer. The effective viscosity increases with confining pressure, decreases with vibration amplitude, and exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on frequency: weakening is observed at intermediate frequencies but is lost at high frequencies. We show that the rheological response is governed by the balance between grain-scale agitation energy and the stabilizing effect of confinement. This framework reconciles previously observed trends in viscosity and friction weakening and emphasizes the central role of energy injection and dissipation in determining granular flow properties under vibration.

arXiv:2511.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium relaxation of a spatial density modulation in a one-dimensional, weakly interacting Bose gas, and its connection to the equilibrium scattering rate $\smash{\gamma_k\propto k^{3/2}}$ of the system's phononic excitations. We show that the relaxation is generally governed by a nonequilibrium scattering rate $\gamma_{k,t}$ coupled to quantum fluctuations, which approaches its equilibrium value $\gamma_k$ only at long times. Numerical simulations of quantum kinetic equations reveal an algebraic convergence, $\smash{\gamma_{k,t} - \gamma_k \sim t^{-2/3}}$, confirmed by analytical predictions. More broadly, our results establish a theoretical framework for experimentally probing phonon dynamics through the temporal evolution of local perturbations in quantum gases.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the binding energy and electron-hole (e-h) overlap of excitonic states confined at the interface between two-dimensional materials with type-II band alignment, i.e., with lowest conduction and highest valence band edges placed in different materials, arranged in a side-by-side planar heterostructure. We propose a variational procedure within the effective mass approximation to calculate the exciton ground state and apply our model to a monolayer MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ heterostructure. The role of nonabrupt interfaces between the materials is accounted for in our model by assuming a W$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ alloy around the interfacial region. Our results demonstrate that (i) interface-bound excitons are energetically favorable only for small interface thickness and/or for systems under high dielectric screening by the materials surrounding the monolayer, and that (ii) the interface exciton binding energy and its e-h overlap are controllable by the interface width and dielectric environment.

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, characterized by the coexistence of atypical non-thermal eigenstates within an otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum. In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom. Our results illustrate the power and interplay of interference-based and algebraic mechanisms of non-ergodicity, offering systematic routes to identifying and classifying QMBS in generic many-body quantum systems.

Abstract: Nonuniform strain in graphene acts as a valley-dependent gauge field, generating pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) that mimic real magnetic fields but preserve global time-reversal symmetry. While local probes have visualized such fields, their quantitative detection via macroscopic transport has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that high-mobility graphene exhibits distinct beating patterns in Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, arising from valley-resolved Landau quantization under different effective magnetic fields. Systematic analysis of these beats reveals universal quadratic and linear scaling of the node carrier density and Landau level filling factor with the applied magnetic field, enabling the extraction of PMFs as small as a few millitesla. Our results establish quantum oscillation spectroscopy as a robust and broadly applicable probe of strain-induced gauge fields in Dirac materials, opening avenues for mechanically tunable valleytronic and straintronic devices.

arXiv:2511.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Raman experiments on the Kitaev material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have reported a finite Raman circular dichroism (RCD), revealing chiral phonon behaviour not expected from lattice symmetry alone. To explain this observation, we develop a diagrammatic framework for the spin-phonon coupled Kitaev model. We demonstrate that bare phonons contribute no RCD, but coupling to the chiral spin excitation continuum under an applied magnetic field renormalizes the phonon propagator, mixing real polarization eigenvectors into complex superpositions with finite angular momentum. This interaction-induced modification generates a nonzero RCD accompanied by characteristic Fano line shapes in the Raman response, reflecting interference between discrete phonons and the continuum. The resulting signal grows with magnetic field strength, consistent with experiment, and directly tracks the field-induced chirality of the spin sector. More broadly, our results establish RCD as a powerful probe of interaction-induced chiral phonons in correlated quantum materials.

Abstract: Anisotropic intersite exchange interactions in frustrated rare-earth magnets are difficult to assess both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we propose an ab initio force-theorem framework combining the quasi-atomic Hubbard-I approach to 4f correlations with a static mean-field treatment of the on-site intershell Coulomb interaction between rare-earth 4f and 5d states to simultaneously capture both 4f superexchange and 5d-mediated indirect exchange. Applying it to the triangular lattice Ce delafossites CsCeSe$_2$, KCeS$_2$, and RbCeO$_2$, we find that the indirect exchange dominates in the selenide, the superexchange in the oxide, while both mechanisms contribute almost equally in the sulfide. The magnetic exciation spectra of CsCeSe$_2$ and KCeS$_2$ evaluated from the calculated spin Hamiltonains are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental data.

Abstract: The increasing importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials research has created demand for automated, high-throughput characterization techniques capable of generating large data sets rapidly. We describe here a new instrument for simultaneous x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy optimized for high-throughput studies of combinatorial specimens. A bright, focused, high-energy x-ray beam 24 keV) combined with a pixel array area detector allows rapid, spatially-resolved (250 {\mu}m) transmission diffraction measurements through thick (100 {\mu}m) specimens of structural metals with exposure times as short as 1 s. Simultaneously, a silicon drift detector records x-ray fluorescence from the specimen for spatially-resolved measurement of composition. Specimen handling is fully automated, with a robot inside the x-ray enclosure manipulating the sample for measurements at different locations. Data orchestration is also automated, with data streamed off the instrument and processed autonomously. In this paper we assess the performance of the instrument in terms of throughput, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio, and provide an example of its capabilities through a combinatorial study of Cu-Ti alloys to demonstrate rapid data set creation.

Abstract: The hexagonal $\beta$-phase of sodium yttrium fluoride (NaYF) is a leading host material for lanthanide upconversion and anti-Stokes fluorescence laser refrigeration based on its low phonon energies and high upconversion efficiency. Recently experiments have been proposed to use this material as an optically-levitated sensor of high-frequency gravitational waves. In order to maximize signal-to-noise in this experiment, the NaYF sensor must have both a two-dimensional, disk-like morphology and also a large mass. Here we report a novel hydrothermal process based on the chelation ligand methylimidodiacetic acid (MIDA) to realize hexagonal $\beta$-NaYF prisms with corner-to-corner diameters up to 44 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ while keeping the height around 1 $\mathrm{\mu m}$. The surface quality is comparable to particles synthesized with EDTA based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. Unlike particles synthesized with EDTA the $\beta$-NaYF particles show no lensing based on curvature of the hexagonal basal plane. Single crystal X-ray diffraction data were refined to the P-62c (#190) space group which to the best of our knowledge has not been reported in the literature. One of six 44 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ $\beta$-NaYF disks doped with 10% ytterbium showed laser refrigeration of ($-4.9 \pm 1.0$) K suggesting future applications in both levitated optomechanics and microoptics.

Abstract: The momentum-space signatures of excitons can be experimentally accessed through time-resolved (pump-probe) photoelectron spectroscopy. In this work, we develop a computational framework for exciton photoemission orbital tomography (exPOT) in periodic systems, enabling the simulation and interpretation of experimental observables within many-body perturbation theory. By connecting the $GW$+Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) approach to photoemission tomography, our formalism captures exciton photoemission in periodic systems, explicitly incorporating photoemission matrix element effects induced by the probe pulse. The correlated nature of electrons and holes introduces distinct consequences for excitonic photoemission, including a dependence on pump pulse polarization. Using the prototypical two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride, we demonstrate these effects and show how our framework extends to excitons with finite center-of-mass momentum, making it well-suited to studying momentum-dark excitons. This provides valuable insights into the microscopic nature of excitonic phenomena in quantum materials.

arXiv:2511.14960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth nickelates RNiO3 (R=rare-earth element) exhibit three kinds of phase transitions with decreasing temperature: a structural transition from a pseudo-cubic to a monoclinic phase, a metal- insulator transition (MIT), and a magnetic transition from a paramagnetic state to an ordered one. The first two occur at the same temperature, which has led to a consensus that the MIT is driven by lattice distortions. We show here that the primary driving force for the MIT is magnetic; however because of the unusual d7 configuration of Ni, additional flexibility in spin configurations are also needed which symmetry-lowing structural deformations make possible. The latter enable Ni to disproportionate into two kinds: a high-spin and a low-spin configuration, which allow the system to reduce its unfavorable orbital moment and also open a gap.

arXiv:2511.14965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercritical CO2 (scCO2) plays a crucial role as a solvent in separation processes, advanced power cycles, and green chemical and materials processing. Nonetheless, the atomistic comprehension of how the dense scCO2 matrix influences the fundamental combustion of carbon monoxide (CO) is still insufficiently explored. Experimental studies and traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations frequently fail to detect the highly reactive, transient intermediates, such as atomic oxygen (O), that drive these reactions. To fill this knowledge gap, we have developed a novel ReaxFF reactive force field for the CO2/CO/O system. To effectively model CO2 crystal properties, intermolecular interactions, bond energies, and critical reaction energy barriers, the force field parameters were calibrated using data obtained from the density functional theory and second-order Moller-Plesset calculations. The force field was able to reproduce the cohesive energy of the CO2 crystal, the pressure characteristics of bulk scCO2, and the structural properties of liquid and scCO2, as documented by experiments, ab-initio MD, and prominent non-reactive models. The force field was subsequently applied to study the CO + O = CO2 reaction. In a dilute gas-phase environment, the reaction exhibits inefficiency as the newly formed CO2 rapidly dissociates back due to substantial kinetic energy acquired from the exothermic reaction. Conversely, in a dense scCO2 environment, the surrounding CO2 matrix acts as an efficient third body, stabilizing the emerging CO2 product by dissipating its excess energy via molecular collisions. As such, this ReaxFF force field facilitates a unique, large-scale reactive MD description of radical chemistry in scCO2 and establishes a mechanistic foundation for third-body stabilization in dense reactive environments.

Abstract: A functional heterostructure is central to integrated circuitry in quantum photonics, optoelectronics, neuromorphic computing, spintronics, and straintronics. Recently, heterostructures combining 2D magnets and nonmagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been explored. In these, electron and hole wavefunctions are localized in 2D magnets but delocalized in TMDs. When combined, a proximity induced magnetic inter layer exciton can emerge, with energy differing by 20 to 30 meV from intra layer excitons and being two orders of magnitude darker, making it hard to detect and functionalize. Using a high fidelity ab initio many body diagrammatic approach, we show that functionality can be significantly enhanced in a transition metal molecule TMD interface. The molecular exciton exhibits charge transfer character and is extended, unlike the localized Frenkel excitation in 2D magnets. Moreover, the degree of localization and magnetic moment can be tuned by varying the molecular orientation relative to the TMD. This changes the proximity to the magnetic ion, altering screening and enabling a pathway to quench the ion's spin moment. This inverse proximity effect tunes the energies, spin states, and brightness of molecular and inter layer magnetic excitons, a mechanism absent in 2D magnet TMD systems. We also identify conditions under which the interlayer exciton becomes well separated and brighter than intra layer excitons, making it promising for protocols that probe and manipulate magnetic excitonic states.

Abstract: This work presents a dimensional reduction of Bose-Einstein condensates confined by generalized transverse potentials, parametrized by an exponent $n$. Starting from the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we employ a variational ansatz to derive an effective one-dimensional nonpolynomial Schr\"odinger equation, which self-consistently determines the transverse width dynamics. The model generalizes existing formalisms for cigar- and funnel-shaped geometries. We validate the approach through comprehensive numerical tests, demonstrating excellent agreement with full 3D simulations for ground-state properties across various interaction regimes. Finally, real-time simulations of matter-wave scattering at potential barriers verify the model's dynamical robustness, successfully replicating the spatiotemporal evolution and energy-dependent transmission characteristics observed in full 3D calculations.

Abstract: Active thermal management requires advances in thermal switching materials, whose thermal conductivity responds to external stimuli. The electric field, as one of the most convenient and effective stimuli, has shown great potential in tuning the thermal conductivity of ferroelectric materials. While previous studies on electric-field-induced ferroelectric thermal switching have primarily focused on thin films and bulk solid solutions with strong extrinsic interface and defect scatterings, bulk single crystals, which can offer clear insights into intrinsic thermal switching mechanisms, have received comparatively less attention. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced thermal switching in bulk single-crystalline $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$ (BTO) at room temperature and elucidate the critical role of domain evolution and aging in governing heat transport. Using a customized steady-state platform with in-situ electric fields up to $\pm$10 kV/cm, we observe a modulation of thermal conductivity up to 35% in fresh BTO driven by polarization reorientation and domain restructuring. First-principles finite-temperature lattice-dynamics calculations confirm that the switching behavior primarily originates from anisotropic phonon transport associated with domain configuration rather than strain-induced changes in phonon velocities. We further reveal that both ambient aging and controlled thermal aging can enhance the switching contrast through the formation and alignment of defect dipoles that modulate phonon-defect scattering. These results establish defect-domain interactions as a powerful design parameter for ferroelectric thermal switches and demonstrate a versatile experimental platform for exploring field-tunable heat transport and phase behavior in bulk functional materials.

Abstract: The simulation of borosilicate glasses is challenging due to the composition and temperature dependent coordination state of boron atoms. Here, we present a newly developed machine learning optimized classical potential for molecular dynamics simulations that achieves transferability across diverse borosilicate glass compositions. Our potential accurately predicts the glass structural variations in short- and medium-range order in different glass compositions, including validating our potential against experimental X-ray structure factor data. Notably, these data are not included in the optimization framework, which focuses exclusively on density and four-fold coordinated boron fraction. We further investigate the impact of empirical parameters in the force field formulation on the microscopic bond lengths, bond angles and the macroscopic densities, providing new insights into the relationship between interatomic potentials and bulk glass behaviors.

arXiv:2511.15009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how finite-window sampling (random spatial truncation) and reciprocal-space radial binning influence the detection of hyperuniformity in disordered systems. Using thirteen representative two-dimensional simulation systems (two stealthy hyperuniform systems with distinct constraint parameters and ; hyperuniform Gaussian pair statistics system; six hyperuniform targeted systems with distinct alpha=0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, 1.5, 3.0, random sequential addition system; Poisson points distribution system; Lennard-Jones fluid system and Yukawa fluid system) and two real biological systems (avian photoreceptor patterns and looped leaf vein networks) We find that moderate random spatial truncation (i.e., randomly extracting a smaller subwindow from the original full-field configuration) does not change qualitatively the hyperuniformity classification of the systems. Specifically, disordered hyperuniform systems retain their respective hyperuniformity classes despite a modest reduction in measured hyperuniformity exponent alpha (i.e., reduction in small-k suppression). Moreover, spatial truncation commonly induces configuration-dependent fluctuations of small-k values of S(k). We show that modest reciprocal-space radial pooling (controlled by a binning parameter m) effectively smooths such spurious wiggles without changing the hyperuniformity class. Practical guidelines for choosing m, cross-checking spectral fits with the local number variance scaling, and increasing effective sampling are provided. These results provide concrete, low-cost and effective methodology for robust spectral detection of hyperuniformity in finite and truncated datasets which abound in experimental systems.

arXiv:2511.15017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an entropy based framework for analyzing symmetry breaking in dynamical systems. Information transfer, which measures the directional exchange of entropy between observables, provides a quantitative early indicator of symmetry loss. For local spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), we show that as a symmetric equilibrium approaches instability, trajectories exhibit pronounced critical slowing down accompanied by a rise in Shannon entropy. This establishes a direct link between symmetry loss, slowing down, and entropy growth. We further characterize the entropy discontinuity associated with global symmetry breaking (GSSB) through an ergodic decomposition viewpoint. Numerical examples illustrate that entropy and information transfer measures serve as reliable precursors and diagnostics of symmetry breaking transitions.

arXiv:2511.15020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs), formed by incorporating Josephson junctions into loops of superconducting material, are the backbone of many modern quantum sensing systems. It has been demonstrated that, by combining multiple SQUID loops into a two-dimensional (2D) array, it is possible to fabricate ultra-high-performing Radio frequency sensors. However, to function as absolute magnetometers, current-in-use arrays require the area of each SQUID loop in the array to be incommensurate and, in turn, forbid the achievement of their full potential in terms of quantum-limited performances. This is because imposing incommensurability in the areas contrasts with optimised performance in each single SQUID loop. In this work, we report that by selectively inserting bare sections of a superconducting circuit with no Josephson junctions, 2D SQUID arrays can operate as an absolute magnetometer even when no physical area spread is applied. Based on a generalisation of current available theories, a complete analytical formulation for the one-to-one correspondence between the distribution of these bare loops and what we call a synthetic area spread is unveiled. This synthetic spread represents the equivalent physical spread of incommensurate SQUID loops that you will use to obtain the absolute Voltage-Magnetic Flux response if no bare loops were in use. Our work opens the way to a broader use of this technology for the fabrication of ultra-high-performance absolute quantum sensors. Our approach is also experimentally verified by fabricating several 2D SQUID arrays incorporating bare superconducting loops and by demonstrating that they behave in alignment with what is suggested by our theory.

arXiv:2511.15027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi2O2Se is an emerging semiconductor with intrinsically low thermal conductivity, making it a promising material for thermoelectric applications. Hydrostatic pressure can effectively tunes the thermal conductivity, with various pressure-dependent trends reported. However, its impact on thermal anisotropy, particularly in the highly anisotropic Bi2O2Se, remains poorly understood. Here, we report a pressure-driven reversal of thermal anisotropy: k_z < k_x at 0 GPa transforms into k_z > k_x at 60 GPa without phase transition. This stems from distinct phonon dispersions along the x- and z-directions under pressure, leading to a reshaped group velocity landscape. Below 10 meV, vz > vx at both pressures, with a much greater advantage at 60 GPa. Above 10 meV, vx > vz at 0 GPa; however, the difference nearly vanishes at 60 GPa. These changes result from anisotropic lattice compression, with the z-axis shrinking more significantly than the x-axis and suppressing the lone pair activity of Bi atoms. This study calls for revisiting the pressure dependence of thermal conductivity anisotropy and provides insights for pressure-driven thermal switching applications.

Abstract: Conventional strategies for enhancing creep resistance often rely on grain boundary strengthening, yet this approach can inadvertently promote premature grain boundary fracture. This study presents a subtractive alloy design strategy for nickel-based directionally solidified superalloys (DS superalloy) through elimination of conventional grain boundary strengthening elements (C, B, Zr) and the strategy improves the creep performance by 60% rivaling 2nd generation single crystal superalloys. Through characterization of heat-treated and heat-exposed microstructures, we confirm the suppression of deleterious grain boundary phases. Creep tests and fracture analysis reveal a critical transition in failure mechanism: the removal of these elements shifts the fracture mode from transgranular to intergranular. Our discussion comprehensively links this microstructural engineering to the underlying creep deformation mechanisms, showing that the enhanced performance stems from stabilization of {\gamma} channel and phase interfaces within grains, as well as strengthening of grain boundaries through serration. This work establishes a novel materials design principle that decouples grain boundary strengthening from elemental additions, offering transformative potential for next-generation high-efficiency turbine blade applications.

Here we develop an atomically dispersed nickel-nitrogen-carbon (Ni-NC) catalyst through a scalable synthesis approach using two different carbon supports. When using carbon nanotubes as the support, the resulting Ni-NCNT electrode achieves a partial current density toward CO of 558 mA cm-2 with 92 percent Faradaic efficiency toward CO at a cell voltage of 3.2 V and an energy efficiency of 39 percent toward CO at a total current density of 607 mA cm-2. The MEA demonstrates stable operation at 100 mA cm-2 over 210 hours, outperforming previously reported Ni-NC catalysts. Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography illustrates the key role of catalyst support on the performance of the electrode. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations using 3D reconstructed images of the catalyst layers from FIB-SEM tomography demonstrate that the higher CO2R performance of the Ni-NCNT electrode is due to improved CO2 diffusion and a more uniform current-density distribution compared to the Ni-NCB electrode prepared with carbon black as the support. The stability and performance of the Ni-NCNT compare favorably to state-of-the-art Ag-based catalysts, while bottom-up cost analysis estimates the purchase cost of the Ni-NCNT catalyst to be about 589 USD per kg, substantially lower than the 1900 USD per kg estimated for Ag-based catalysts.

Abstract: The significantly weak interlayer coupling strength and puckered structure provide the novel layer-tolerant and anisotropic features in two-dimensional (2D) ReS2. These unique features offer an opportunity to modulate the optoelectronic, vibrational, and transport properties along different lattice directions in ReS2. Here, using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we investigated the thermal transport properties of ReS2 in AA and AB stacking orders. The anisotopic ratios for lattice thermal conductivities (\k{appa}) are found to be 1.08 and 1.12 for AA and AB stacking, respectively. This anisotropic nature remains intact even at higher temperatures up to 1000K, demonstrating anisotropic robustness. Lower symmetry in AB stacking leads to higher phonon scattering, which results in lower group velocity, smaller phonon lifetime, and thereby lower \k{appa} along both directions as compared to AA stacking. The strong breathing and shear Raman modes in AB stacking indicate stronger layer coupling, further confirming the dominant contribution of acoustic modes towards thermal transport. The findings underscore that the stacking-order-driven preferential heat flow in ReS2 and opens up a new dimension for optimizing device performance.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based framework have evolved rapidly and generated considerable interests for predicting the properties of materials. In this work, we utilize ML-DL framework to predict the electrochemical lithiation state and associated electrical conductivity of spinel Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) thin films using Raman spectroscopy data. Raman spectroscopy, with its rapid, non-destructive, and high-resolution capabilities, is leveraged to monitor dynamic electrochemical changes in LTO films. A comprehensive dataset of 3,272 Raman spectra, representing lithiation states from 0% to 100%, was collected and preprocessed using advanced techniques including cosmic ray removal, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, and data augmentation. Classical machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Random Forest (RF) were evaluated alongside a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). While traditional models achieved moderate to high accuracy, they struggled with generalization and noise sensitivity. In contrast, the CNN demonstrated superior performance, achieving over 99.5% accuracy and robust predictions on unseen samples. The CNN model effectively captured non-linear spectral features and showed resilience to experimental variability. This pipeline not only enables accurate lithiation state classification but also facilitates conductivity estimation, offering a scalable approach for real-time battery material characterization and potential extension to other spectroscopic datasets.

Abstract: We use a near-field magnetic microwave microscope to investigate and compare rf vortex nucleation in two superconducting radio-frequency (SRF)-quality Nb3Sn films fabricated by different methods: a conventional vapor-diffused film and an electrochemically plated film followed by thermal annealing, both of which are deposited on Nb substrates. The microscope applies a localized rf magnetic field to the sample surface and measures the resulting third-harmonic response P3f, which is particularly sensitive to rf vortex nucleation triggered by surface defects. Both Nb3Sn films exhibit nontrivial P3f(T) structures below 7 K that display the key signatures associated with rf vortex nucleation at local defects. The electrochemical film additionally shows multiple P3f(T) structures between 14 K and 16 K that are absent in the vapor-diffused sample. Our results highlight the influence of fabrication method on rf vortex penetration properties and demonstrate the utility of third-harmonic response as a local diagnostic tool for surface defects in Nb3Sn films.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are phases of matter which are distinguished not by the symmetries they break, but rather by the patterns of entanglement within them. Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.

Abstract: The ramp-reversal memory (RRM) effect in metal-insulator transition metal oxides (TMOs), a non-volatile resistance change induced by repeated temperature cycling, has attracted considerable interest in neuromorphic computing and non-volatile memory devices. Our previously introduced defect motion model successfully explained RRM in vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$), capturing observed critical temperature shifts and memory accumulation throughout the sample. However, this approach lacked interactions between metallic and insulating domains, whereas the RRM only appears when TMOs are brought into the metal-insulator coexistence regime. Here, we extend our model by combining the Random Field Ising Model with defect diffusion-segregation, thereby enabling accurate hysteresis modeling while predicting the relationship between RRM and domain interactions. Our simulations demonstrate that maximum RRM occurs when the turnaround temperature approaches the warming branch inflection point, consistent with experimental observations on VO$_2$. Most significantly, we find that increasing nearest-neighbor interactions enhances the maximum memory effect, thus providing a clear mechanism for optimizing RRM performance. Since our model employs minimal assumptions, we predict that RRM should be a widespread phenomenon in materials exhibiting patterned phase coexistence of electronic domains. This work not only advances fundamental understanding of memory behavior in TMOs but also establishes a much-needed theoretical framework for optimizing device applications.

Abstract: We analyse the critical properties of a weakly diluted (random) Ising model with the long-range interaction decaying with distance $x$ as $\sim x^{-d-\sigma}$ in a $d$-dimensional space. It is known to belong to a new long-range random universality class for certain values of the decay parameter $\sigma$. Exploiting the field-theoretic renormalization group approach within the minimal subtraction scheme, we compute the three-loop rermalization group functions. On their basis, with the help of asymptotic series resummation methods, we estimate the correlation length critical exponent $\nu$ characterising the new universality class for $d=3$ and for those values of $\sigma$ for which long-range interactions are relevant for the critical behaviour.

Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$), a layered van der Waals material, has attracted considerable attention as a promising alternative to graphene for applications in field-effect transistors and nanophotonic devices because of its sizable band gap, high carrier mobility, large on/off ratio, and strong photoluminescence efficiency. A particularly intriguing property of MoS$_2$ is the transition of its band gap character with layer thickness: while the monolayer exhibits a direct gap, the band gap becomes indirect in multilayer and bulk forms. To clarify the microscopic mechanism behind this transition, we performed first-principles calculations combined with Wannier-based modeling, focusing on the roles of atomic orbitals and interlayer interactions. While orbitals oriented perpendicular to the plane -- such as Mo-$d_{z^2}$ and S-$p_z$ -- have been considered the primary contributors, our analysis reveals that in-plane $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals of S atoms also play a significant role. These findings highlight the importance of both out-of-plane and in-plane orbital contributions in governing the electronic structure of layered MoS$_2$, providing deeper insight into its band gap engineering for future device applications.

arXiv:2511.15195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two-dimensional systems of deformable particles undergo a continuous liquid-hexatic transition upon compression or cooling, but no hexatic-solid transition-even at zero temperature and high density. Numerical simulations reveal that solid-like configurations do not possess a lower energy than hexatic ones, so that at low temperatures the hexatic phase is thermodynamically favored due to its higher entropy. Dislocation condensation, necessary for solid formation, is suppressed as the system accommodates strain via particle shape changes, responding affinely to compression. Our findings identify a generic route by which microscopic mechanical properties control defect energetics and reshape phase behavior in two dimensions, with broad relevance for soft and biological materials such as microgels and epithelial tissues.

arXiv:2511.15222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods have become powerful tools for predicting material properties with near first-principles accuracy and vastly reduced computational cost. However, the performance of ML models critically depends on the quality, size, and diversity of the training dataset. In materials science, this dependence is particularly important for learning from low-symmetry atomistic configurations that capture thermal excitations, structural defects, and chemical disorder, features that are ubiquitous in real materials but underrepresented in most datasets. The absence of systematic strategies for generating representative training data may therefore limit the predictive power of ML models in technologically critical fields such as energy conversion and photonics. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of graph neural network (GNN) models trained on two fundamentally different types of datasets: one composed of randomly generated atomic configurations and another constructed using physically informed sampling based on lattice vibrations. As a case study, we address the challenging task of predicting electronic and mechanical properties of a prototypical family of optoelectronic materials under realistic finite-temperature conditions. We find that the phonons-informed model consistently outperforms the randomly trained counterpart, despite relying on fewer data points. Explainability analyses further reveal that high-performing models assign greater weight to chemically meaningful bonds that control property variations, underscoring the importance of physically guided data generation. Overall, this work demonstrates that larger datasets do not necessarily yield better GNN predictive models and introduces a simple and general strategy for efficiently constructing high-quality training data in materials informatics.

arXiv:2511.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ultrafine grained magnesium alloy has been produced through room temperature high-pressure torsion (HPT) of solutionised Mg-1.35 wt.%Mn. Dynamic precipitation of nanometer-scale Mn particles occurred during deformation. These particles populated the grain boundaries, acting as pinning sites which allowed the alloy to develop a grain size of 140 nm after 0.5 rotations. Further HPT deformation resulted in a gradual increase in grain size with no increase in precipitate size. Despite the extensive deformation applied, the alloy did not develop a bimodal grain structure and retained a grain size of 230 nm after 10 complete rotations, demonstrating the stability and effectiveness of these pinning particles.

arXiv:2511.15249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a computational framework, based on the VASP and phono3py computer codes, to obtain the thermoelectric figure of merit from the electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions using finite displacements in supercells. Several numerical techniques are developed for efficiency.
  The method is applied to several thermoelectric materials. We found different behaviors for the lifetimes of the electrons in PbTe, PbSe, and in compounds of the half-Heusler and magnesium silicide family. This is traced back to the different frequencies of the phonons involved in the scattering around the Fermi level. They have a lower frequency in PbTe and PbSe.
  The magnitude of the thermoelectric figures of merit we computed compare well with experiments, but the agreement is far from perfect. The role of the defects, not explicitly considered in our calculations, but abundant in thermoelectric materials, is discussed as a possible explanation. It is also shown that the choice of the exchange-correlation functional can strongly impact the results.

Abstract: The precise crystal structure of La3Ni2O7 in its high-pressure superconducting state has been a subject of intense debate, with proposed models including both orthorhombic and tetragonal symmetries. Using high-pressure Raman spectroscopy combined with frst-principles calculations, we unravel the structural evolution of La3Ni2O7 under pressure up to 32.7 GPa. We identify a clear structural transition sequence: from the orthorhombic Amam phase to a mixed Amam+Fmmm phase at 4 GPa, followed by a complete transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at 14.5 GPa, which is signaled by a pronounced phonon renormalization. The emergence of bulk superconductivity is found to coincide precisely with this transition to the I4/mmm phase. Our results de nitively establish the tetragonal I4/mmm structure as the host of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, resolving a central controversy and providing a critical foundation for understanding the superconducting mechanism in nickelates.

arXiv:2511.15268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium topological phases of monolayer 1T$^\prime$--MoS$_2$ under high-frequency circularly polarized driving using a low-energy $k\!\cdot\!p$ Hamiltonian combined with a van Vleck expansion. The off-resonant field generates spin- and valley-dependent mass corrections that reshape the Berry curvature profile and shift the conditions for band inversion. By evaluating the quasienergy bands, Berry curvatures, Hall conductivities, and spin- valley-resolved Chern numbers, we identify a sequence of light-controlled topological transitions marked by well-defined gap closings. Depending on the Floquet coupling strength and the electric-field parameter, the system evolves between the equilibrium quantum spin Hall (QSH) state and a set of driven phases including spin-polarized quantum Hall insulator (S-QHI), quantum valley Hall (QVH or BI) and photo-induced quantum Hall insulator (P-QHI) regimes. The results establish 1T$^\prime$--MoS$_2$ as a tunable platform where circular driving selectively manipulates spin and valley degrees of freedom, enabling controlled access to non-equilibrium topological phases in transition-metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: Metal halide perovskites exhibit coupled electronic and ionic properties that determine their photovoltaic performance and operational stability. Understanding and quantifying ionic transport are therefore essential for advancing perovskite optoelectronics. Conventional electrical methods such as impedance spectroscopy require fully integrated devices, and their interpretation is often complicated by interfacial and contact effects, limiting the ability to isolate intrinsic ionic behavior. Here, a localized adaptation of intensity-modulated photoluminescence spectroscopy (IMPLS) is utilized to optically probe lateral ionic transport in perovskite films. The frequency-dependent photoluminescence response is measured under controlled carrier injection levels and correlated with the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). The proposed diffusion model indicates that mobile ionic defects laterally migrate from high light intensity regions, giving rise to characteristic photoluminescence modulations. Ionic diffusion coefficients extracted from IMPLS agree well with literature values obtained from electrical measurements. Importantly, IMPLS mapping separates mobile and immobile defect contributions through a defect contrast coefficient (DCC), which quantifies the normalized difference between the area-averaged photoluminescence intensity and phase data. This work ultimately demonstrates that localized IMPLS provides a contact-free means to extract lateral ion diffusion coefficients while spatially distinguishing defect types across the sample.

arXiv:2511.15337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new mechanism that produces a Hall-like response in time-reversal-invariant materials, driven entirely by geometric effects. Specifically, we demonstrate that a tilted potential interface causes electron wave packets to undergo a refraction-like deflection upon transmission through the barrier, leading to a finite transverse current and a corresponding Hall conductance. Our analytical framework captures the essential features of this refraction Hall effect, and the resulting Hall conductivity profile is corroborated by numerical simulations across different lattice models and device geometries. We further visualize our predicted effect through real-time wave packet dynamics, which reveals its purely geometric origin and the robustness of the transverse response. These findings establish a fundamentally distinct class of Hall-like transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems that preserve time-reversal symmetry.

Abstract: Aggregation processes in systems of planar macromolecules and colloids drive a broad range of phenomena in natural systems and soft materials. Depending on chemical architecture, intermolecular interactions in these systems may favor different relative pair orientations, such as stacking face-face or percolating edge-edge arrangements. In this work, we employ a versatile coarse-grained interaction model for disk-like particles to provide a general framework to rationalize the thermotropic formation of aggregates and predict the topology of the resulting suprastructures. Monte Carlo and Brownian Dynamics simulations show that, with an appropriate tuning of the interactions, discotics spontaneously nucleate into clusters with globular, planar or stacked geometries, leading to materials with specific internal order and associated physicochemical properties.

Abstract: We present a rare example of a one-dimensional system with short-range range interactions for which a self-stabilizing long-range ordered phase persists to finite temperatures. Our model offers a new perspective on the origins of shape anisotropy on the mesoscopic scale in magnetic metamaterials. Specifically, we show how the combination of a physically realistic stray-field potential and the spatial dimensionality of the system can reduce the effective dimensionality of classical magnetic mesospins. The resulting emergent constraints on the magnetic excitation spectrum underpin the observed ordering, in stark contrast to the behaviour of analogous one-dimensional models with strictly isotropic spins.

Abstract: We present an exact analytical solution for the one-dimensional Ising model in the presence of an external magnetic field applied periodically to every $k$-th site. The problem is handled using the symmetrized transfer matrix approach, we derive a compact closed-form expression for the system's eigenvalues for arbitrary period $k$. From the resulting free energy, we obtain exact expressions for the magnetization and zero-field susceptibility. Explicit results are presented for $k = 1$, $k = 2$, and $k = 3$ which is considered a novel result. We further analyze the spin-spin correlation functions, deriving the correlation length and the set of position-dependent correlation strength prefactors, $A_{ij}$. The framework highlights how impurity spacing suppresses thermodynamic responses, with susceptibility scaling as $\chi \sim \beta / k$ for large $k$, offering insights into diluted magnetic systems and serving as a benchmark for quasiperiodic modulations. The correlation strengths exhibit a strong anisotropy, revealing a complex, non-local structure of spin fluctuations. These results provide a complete and rigorous benchmark for understanding the effects of periodic modulation in 1D systems.

Abstract: Lithium halides with the general formula Li$_x$M$_y$X$_6$, where M indicates transition metal ions and X halide anions are very actively studied as solid-state electrolytes, because of relatively low cost, high stability and Li conductivity. The structure and properties of these halide-based solid electrolytes (HSE) can be tuned by alloying, e.g. using different halides and/or transition metals simultaneously. The large chemical space is difficult to sample by experiments, making simulations based on broadly applicable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) a promising approach to elucidate structure-property relations, and facilitate the design of better-performing compositions. Here we focus on the Li$_3$YCl$_{6x}$Br$_{6(1-x)}$ system, for which reliable experimental data exists, and use the recently-developed PET-MAD universal MLIP to investigate the structure of the alloy, the interplay of crystalline lattice, volume and chemical composition, and its effect on Li conductivity. We find that the distribution of Cl and Br atoms is only weakly correlated, and that the primary effect of alloying is to modulate the lattice parameter -- although it can also trigger transition between different lattice symmetries. By comparing constant-volume and constant-pressure simulations, we disentangle the effect of lattice parameter and chemical composition on the conductivity, finding that the two effects compensate each other, reducing the overall dependency of conductivity on alloy composition. We also study the effect of Y-In metal substitution finding a small increase in the conductivity for the C2/m phase at 25\% In content, and an overall higher conductivity for the P$\bar{3}$m1 phase.

arXiv:2511.15449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling in atoms and molecules adsorbed at metal surfaces gives rise to finite vibrational linewidths in infrared or electron energy loss spectra. When it is the dominant contribution to the vibrational lifetime, it manifests itself in the form of a Fano line shape. Here, we report the linewidths of vibrational modes of chemisorbed hydrogen on the (100) and (110) surfaces of molybdenum and tungsten calculated from first-order time-dependent perturbation theory. For those modes with a Fano line shape, our results are in good agreement with the experiment. We further observe that the coupling strength between vibrations and electrons depends on the nature of the mode: for Lorentzian-shaped peaks, the experimental linewidths are always larger than those predicted based on pure electron-phonon coupling. The calculated linewidths exhibit a strong coverage dependence, decreasing towards higher coverages. This finding has important implications for nonadiabatic energy dissipation in hydrogen dynamics at metal surfaces. While electron-hole pair excitation is the dominant energy-transfer mechanism between hydrogen and pristine metal surfaces, other channels for energy dissipation, such as adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, may become more significant on metal surfaces densely covered with hydrogen.

Abstract: This paper investigates several distinct attempts to generalize in higher dimension the standard 2-dimensional phyllotaxy set construction. We first recall known contructions for these sets on $2D$ manifolds of constant curvature (the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$, the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ and the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$). We then propose a first attempt to get a $3D$ phyllotactic set by piling up suitably shifted Euclidean $2D$ phyllotactic sets. A different, radially triggered, solution is then analyzed. An interesting phyllotactic set on the hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^3$ is then generated using a Hopf fibration approach. Finally,a simple 4-dimensional example is presented, generated as a simple product of two 2-dimensional planar sets. A $3D$ phyllotaxy candidate is then derived by applying a "Cut and Project" algorithm.

Abstract: Fractionalized excitations such as spinons and anyons have emerged as a central theme in condensed matter physics with broad implications for superconductivity, quantum statistics, and quantum computation. The nearly ideal one-dimensional $S=1/2$ system $\beta$-VOSO$_4$ without long-range order down to 85 mK provides a promising platform to experimentally explore such fractionalized excitations. Here, we employ Raman spectroscopy to probe magnetic excitations and the evolution of spin correlations in $\beta$-VOSO$_4$. Spinon signatures are found along the chain direction, evidenced by a broad, gapless scattering continuum at low temperatures. The temperature dependence of the spinon spectral weight aligns considerably with numerical density matrix renormalization group calculations. By comparing the experimental spinon spectral weight with calculated results and evaluating the associated quantum Fisher information (QFI) therefrom, we observe a steep increase in QFI upon cooling, indicating rapidly growing correlation lengths. Our study showcases QFI as a probe of spin correlations in quantum magnets.

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the XXZ model on the sawtooth spin chain with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in which all exchange constants (symmetric, antisymmetric and axial anisotropy) are different for the three different bonds of each triangle.
  We derive and resolve algebraic constraints on the exchange constants ensuring the appearance of a flat band in the one-magnon spectrum.
  The properties of the corresponding flat magnon bands and localized magnon states are analyzed.
  We further construct the mapping of the flat-band conditions for the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya constants onto the Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky parameters.
  Based on the mapping the possibility of the electric field driven flat bands with aid of the magnetoelectric coupling is examined.

Abstract: Energetic ion irradiation is an effective method for studying how single and multi-shelled carbon nanotubes break apart. The energy from ions is dissipated through both linear and nonlinear processes in the nanotubes, leading to defect formation. Fragmentation occurs via atomic collision cascades and thermal spikes, each described by different theoretical models. Experiments with Cs-irradiated nanotubes support these models, and an information-theoretic approach further explains the fragmentation mechanisms. Sputtered species yield probability distributions, which are analyzed using Shannon entropy and fractal dimension to assess spatial characteristics. Kullback-Leibler divergence helps identify the diversity of emission mechanisms. Together, thermal and information-theoretic models clarify and distinguish the roles of collision cascades and thermal spikes in nanotube fragmentation.

Abstract: Engineered assemblies of interacting magnetic elements-magnetic metamaterials-provide a powerful route to tailor collective magnetic order and dynamics. By structuring matter at the mesoscale, they bridge atomic magnetism and macroscopic functionality, enabling emergent behaviour inaccessible in conventional materials. However, realizing large-area metamaterials that combine high morphological uniformity with intrinsic long-range order has remained challenging, largely due to the structural disorder inherent to lithographic fabrication. Here we demonstrate a scalable route to structurally and magnetically coherent metamaterials by embedding iron-ions to form mesospins within a non-magnetic thin film palladium host matrix. Using controlled implantation, we realize morphologically uniform arrays that spontaneously develop extended antiferromagnetic order in the as-fabricated state - without the need of external annealing or field cycling. Resonant X-ray scattering and microscopy reveal sharp magnetic Bragg peaks modulated by the mesospin form factor, evidencing long-range antiferromagnetic order coupled to structural coherence. This embedded architecture establishes a platform for exploring coherent spin-photon interactions and functional X-ray scattering in magnetic metamaterials free from lithographic topography and disorder.

Abstract: We elucidate the electronic structure and quantum many-body instabilities of the monolayer nickelate La2NiO4 under hydrostatic pressure using a combination of density functional theory, dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), and random phase approximation (RPA). Our DFT+DMFT calculations reveal non-Fermi-liquid behavior and coherence loss near the Fermi level at low pressures, driven by strong electron correlations within the Ni-e_g orbital manifold, which is analogous to the low-energy electronic properties observed in La3Ni2O7. However, multi-orbital spin susceptibility analysis demonstrates an exceptionally suppressed critical Stoner parameter U_c (about 0.4~0.7 eV), indicating robust magnetic order that dominates the ground state and precludes superconductivity in the pristine system. Below U_c, superconducting instabilities exhibit a pressure-driven symmetry transition: the d_(x2-y2)-wave pairing prevails at ambient and low pressure, while the s+g-wave symmetry occurs above 75 GPa. This transition is attributed to pressure-induced self-doping effect. The high-angular-momentum g-wave component incurs significant energetic penalties, rendering high-Tc superconductivity unlikely. We conclude that the absence of superconductivity in La2NiO4 arises from its robust intrinsic magnetism and the unfavorable pairing symmetry under pressure, suggesting that alternative routes-such as chemical doping or epitaxial strain-are necessary to suppress magnetism and unlock superconducting states.

Abstract: In the U.S., approximately 17 patients die each day awaiting an organ transplant, a crisis driven by the inability to store organs long-term via methods like cryopreservation. A primary failure mechanism is the severe thermo-mechanical damage tissues experience during freezing. A predictive understanding of this damage is hindered by the complex interplay between heat transfer, phase change, and large deformation mechanics. Motivated by this fundamental problem, we present a fully coupled, thermo-mechanical phase-field framework for modeling damage evolution in fluid-saturated soft materials under cryogenic conditions. The theoretical framework integrates heat transfer with solid-liquid phase transition, finite deformation nonlinear elasticity, and progressive mechanical damage. The governing equations are solved using \texttt{FEniCS} finite element package. The presentation will detail the theoretical framework and showcase representative simulations that capture the spatiotemporal evolution of temperature, freezing phase field, stress, and damage fields during representative freezing protocols. The developed framework serves as a powerful tool for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of freezing-induced injury and for designing improved cryopreservation strategies.

Abstract: We investigate theoretically how the injector region design of interband cascade lasers (ICLs) impacts the threshold carrier and current densities. The model combines a polarization-sensitive 8-band $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathrm{p}$ calculation, electrostatics, and a microscopic calculation of Auger recombination rates. The carrier-carrier scattering is included to lowest order within the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. It captures the combined effects of charge carrier redistribution, parasitic absorption and bias voltage on the Auger recombination rate. We show that heavily doping the electron injector suppresses the dominant multi-hole Auger recombination by reducing the hole population of the recombination quantum wells. This agrees with the experimental observation that the heavy doping reduces threshold currents. Yet, our model suggests that the Auger recombination alone is not sufficient to explain the increase of threshold currents at high doping concentrations. Furthermore, by introducing indium to the conventional GaSb hole injector wells, we explain the rule of thumb from experiments that raising the hole injector levels does not outperform the doping strategy. Our model provides physical insights toward optimization of ICL carrier injectors.

Abstract: The interplay between charge density wave (CDW) and superconducting vortex bound states are crucial for fundamental physics of superconductivity and advancing quantum nanotechnologies. However, the CDW-mediated modulation of vortex bound states, which opens up a new platform for vortex engineering, remains unexplored. Here, we report spatially anisotropic vortex states modulated by the unidirectional CDWs in a transition-metal dichalcogenide superconductor 1T''-NbTe2 using ultra-low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The stripe-like 3x1x3 CDW order exhibits a robust three-dimensional character across step edges and coexists with superconductivity below a critical temperature of 0.4 K. Under out-of-plane magnetic fields, we observe elliptical vortices whose elongation aligns with the CDW stripes, indicating strong coupling between vortex morphology and underlying electronic order. Remarkably, CDW domain boundaries induce abrupt changes in vortex orientation and vortex bound states, enabling controllable vortex states across CDW nanodomains. These findings establish a new pathway for manipulating superconducting vortex bound states via CDW coupling.

Abstract: In conventional superconductors, bulk physical properties typically degrade as the film thickness approaches the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here in the (111) oriented LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) heterostructure, we demonstrate experimental evidence that reducing the conducting layer thickness at the interface significantly enhances superconducting transition temperature Tc, in direct contrast to conventional wisdom. From the sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and superconducting upper-critical field measurements, both the trigonal symmetry and spin orbit scattering are enhanced with the increased Tc. We attribute the enhanced superconductivity (SC) to the synergic interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and trigonal crystal field, resulting in an enhanced electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we show the existence of unconventional SC: the approaching linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance with increasing Tc and the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) near the superconducting phase. Our findings provide important insight into the underlying mechanism of the strong orientation-dependent KTO interface SC.

Abstract: A bulk superconductor hosting intrinsic surface superconductivity provides a unique platform to study Majorana bound states. The superconductor, trigonal {\gamma}-PtBi2, is a promising candidate, as surface superconducting gaps and topological surface states have been observed. However, the simultaneous presence of bulk and surface superconductivity has not been resolved. Here, we directly visualize coexisting bulk and surface superconducting gaps in trigonal PtBi2 by using ultra-low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The bulk gap is {\Delta} ~ 0.053 meV with a critical temperature (Tc) ~ 0.5 K and a critical field below 0.01 T, accompanied by a vortex lattice and bound states, yielding a coherence length of ~200 nm. Remarkably, certain surface regions show a much larger gap of {\Delta} ~ 0.42 meV, persisting up to Tc ~ 3 K and surviving magnetic fields up to 2 T, yet lacking a static vortex lattice. This coexistence of robust surface and bulk superconductivity establishes {\gamma}-PtBi2 as a unique platform for investigating the interplay between bulk and surface Cooper pairings in superconducting topological materials.

arXiv:2511.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the emergence of non-Abelian zero modes from twist defects in Abelian topological phases. We consider a setup built from a fractional quantum Hall (FQH)-superconductor heterostructure, which effectively induces a phase transition, leading to a topological phase endowed with new anyonic symmetries, and accordingly supporting distinct types of zero modes at fixed filling. These defects are modeled at the interface between two copies of the same heterostructure arranged side by side, which produces counterpropagating modes that can be gapped by interactions that realize the anyonic symmetries. We characterize the parafermions associated with each anyonic symmetry and discuss how their presence affect the periodicity of Josephson tunneling current.

Abstract: A pair density wave (PDW) is a superconducting state characterized by an order parameter with finite center-of-mass momentum in the absence of an external magnetic field, thereby breaking the conventional translational symmetry in homogeneous superconductors. It is proposed that PDW emerges from magnetic interactions, strong electron-electron correlations, and their interplay with competing orders. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the detection and study of PDWs using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). We focus on how the signatures of PDW have been experimentally visualized across a variety of extraordinary superconductors, including iron-based superconductors, cuprate superconductors, spin-triplet superconductors, kagome-lattice superconductors, and transition metal dichalcogenides. Beginning with an introduction to the fundamental concept of PDWs and the unique capabilities of STM/STS, particularly its atomic-scale spatial resolution and advanced data analysis techniques, we discuss key experimental findings, including the direct visualization of charge density modulations associated with PDWs. Finally, we discuss emerging challenges and future directions, aiming to inspire future research into the nature of PDWs in superconductors.

arXiv:2511.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting real-time dynamics in correlated systems is demanding: exact two-time Green's function methods are accurate but often too costly, while the Generalized Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz (GKBA) offers time-linear propagation at the risk of uncontrolled behavior. We examine when and why GKBA fails in a minimal yet informative setting, the Holstein dimer that describes electron-phonon coupling. Using a conserving, fully self-consistent electron-phonon self-energy, we map out parameter regions where GKBA dynamics is stable and where it becomes unstable. We trace the onset of these failures to qualitative changes in the model's ground-state solutions obtained from the full nonequilibrium Green's function theory, thereby providing practical stability bounds for GKBA time evolution. We further show that coupling the dimer to electronic leads can damp and, in part, cure these instabilities. The results supply simple diagnostics and guidelines for reliable GKBA simulations of electron-phonon dynamics.

Abstract: Here, we provide a detailed study of the crystal structure and physical properties of the recently discovered vdW ferromagnet FePd$_2$Te$_2$. We find this compound has a relatively wide width of formation, and grow single crystals with compositions Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$ where $x$ ranges from 0.9 to 1.1 and $y$ from 1.8 to 2.5, respectively. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and transport measurements reveal that a first-order structural transition occurs in the range of $T$ = 360-420 K. Above the transition, the compounds with Pd fraction $y>2$ adopt a disordered derivative of the tetragonal FeTe structure, with the Fe layer showing mixed Fe/Pd occupancy and the extra Pd atoms partially occupying interstitial sites. Below 370 K, the structure is incommensurately modulated. For $y<2$, the composition Fe$_{1.1}$Pd$_{1.8}$Te$_2$ has monoclinic symmetry at room temperature that is consistent with the reported structure of FePd$_2$Te$_2$. This phase undergoes a structural transition at 420 K for which the high temperature structure is yet to be determined; however, based on the similarities with the $y > 2$ compounds, we speculate that this composition also adopts a tetragonal structure above 420\,K. All compounds investigated in the Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$ series show metallic behavior, with magnetic characterization indicating that they are easy-plane, hard, ferromagnets with $T_C$ spanning 98--180 K. Both the critical temperature for the structural transition and the Curie temperature are moderately suppressed with increasing Pd fraction $y$ and corresponding decreasing Fe fraction $x$, indicating that synthetic control over $x$ and $y$ paves way for the further exploration of these compounds.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the electron-hole asymmetry of antiferromagnetism in cuprates by studying the three-band Emery model. Using parameters relevant to La$_2$CuO$_4$, we benchmark the anti-ferromagnetic response for a large range of dopings with variational Monte Carlo, determinant quantum Monte Carlo, constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo, density-matrix embedding theory, and the Gutzwiller approximation. Across methods and accessible sizes/temperatures, we find no significant electron-hole asymmetry if we consider only Neel anti-ferronagnetic response and ignore other possible orders such as stripe state. This result is robust to a moderate oxygen-site repulsion $U_p$ and to parameter sets of Nd$_2$CuO$_4$. Incorporating dopant-induced local potentials reveals an extrinsic route to asymmetry: Cu-site defects enhance AFM on the electron-doped side, whereas O-site defects suppress it on the hole-doped side. These results indicate that dopant-driven effects make a non-negligible contribution to apparent electron-hole asymmetry in the general phase diagram of cuprates and should be included when analyzing competing orders in cuprates.

Abstract: We present an experimental and theoretical study of the anisotropic pyrochlore phase diagram. Inelastic field-dependent neutron scattering on Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ shows intrinsic broadening and a flat low-energy magnon mode which is partially captured by interacting magnon models. Exact diagonalization reveals the existence of an emergent quantum phase between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, in which Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ Hamiltonian potentially resides. This behavior matches the phenomenology of quantum criticality in heavy fermion systems, and shows Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is a clean system which can be field-tuned from well-defined magnons to a nontrivial quantum ground state. This suggests that quantum criticality is a generic feature of the dipolar phase diagram.

arXiv:2511.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In introductory biology, aging is typically explained as a result of mutations during the DNA replication process within cells. Upon abstraction, we recognize that cellular aging can be understood as the gradual decay in fidelity of information transcription. Since cellular processes are microscopic and inherently stochastic, the abstracted process of information transcription can be understood using Markovian dynamics. In our work, we model the process of information transcription with an autonomous Maxwell's demon (AMD) which interacts with two bitstreams, a lifted mass, and a heat reservoir. As main results, we analyze the steady-state properties of the system with both time-independent and time-dependent transition rates, focusing on the statistics of extractable work, bit transcription fidelity, and two-bit mutual information. Together, these results provide a holistic view of a simplified model for DNA transcription as an information-theoretic process.

arXiv:2511.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of gapped phases driven by the moir\'{e} superlattice that trivialize the topological states in twisted nodal superconductors. The effect arises from umklapp tunneling between non-adjacent Dirac points in momentum space close to specific twist angles or chemical potentials, determined by the Fermi surface geometry. We confirm the robustness of the non-topological phase against interactions with self-consistent calculations and show that this gap competes with the previously predicted topological gapped phases, leading to topological phase transitions. These transitions were overlooked in prior literature, signifying the necessity of modifying the phase diagrams of topological phases exhibited in twisted nodal superconductors with and without an interlayer current. We also estimate the relevant twist angles and discuss experimental signatures, focusing on twisted Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$

Abstract: We analyse a class of SYK models whose Hamiltonian is the sum of two SYK Hamiltonians with different numbers of fermions $q, \tilde q$ in each interaction. We consider both Euclidean and Lorentzian probes of the quantum system in the large $N$ limit. In the strong coupling phase, the entropy provides a diagnostic of the thermal renormalisation group flow. Under certain conditions, two parametrically separated regimes of near-conformal behaviour emerge. The first reproduces the standard linear-in-temperature scaling characteristic of the single SYK model. The system then flows to another near-fixed point whose entropy scaling depends on the ratio $n = q/\tilde q$. For $n<3/2$, the entropy exhibits anomalous, faster-than-linear scaling in temperature. At $n=3/2$, there is an additional logarithmic enhancement. Using conformal perturbation theory, we argue that in the infrared regime of the SYK model, there may exist disordered conformal operators with dimensions $1 < \Delta \leq 3/2$. In Lorentzian signature, we study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and show that these deformed theories exhibit near-maximal chaos in both regimes (when they exist). We comment on the relation between the anomalous scalings found here and those observed in certain near-extremal black holes in two and higher dimensions.

Abstract: We analyze Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models using the doubling method for orthogonal polynomial sequences. This approach yields the analytical spectrum and exact eigenstates of the models. We demonstrate that the standard SSH model is associated with the doubling of Chebyshev polynomials. Extending this technique to the doubling of other finite sequences enables the construction of Hamiltonians for inhomogeneous SSH models which are exactly solvable. We detail the specific cases associated with Krawtchouk and $q$-Racah polynomials. This work highlights the utility of polynomial-doubling techniques in obtaining exact solutions for physical models.

Abstract: Magic is a non-classical resource whose efficient manipulation is fundamental to advancing efficient and scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing. Quantum advantage is possible only if both magic and entanglement are present. Of particular interest is non-local magic- the fraction of the resource that cannot be distilled (or erased) by local unitary operations - which is a necessary feature for quantum complex behavior. We perform the first experimental demonstration of non-local magic in a superconducting Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Direct access to the QPU device enables us to identify and characterize the dominant noise mechanisms intrinsic to the quantum hardware. We observe excellent agreement between theory and experiment without the need for any free parameter in the noise modeling of our system and shows the experimental capability of harnessing both local and non-local magic resources separately, thereby offering a promising path towards more reliable pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices and to advance hardware-aware research in quantum information in the near term. Finally, the methods and tools developed in this work are conducive to the experimental realization of efficient purity estimation (featuring exponential speedup) and the decoding of Hawking radiation from a toy-model of a Black Hole.

Abstract: We present a new class of models for assessing the cell dynamics characterising muscular dystrophies. The proposed approach comprises a system of integro-differential equations for the statistical distributions, over a large patient cohort, of the densities of muscle fibers and immune cells implicated in muscle inflammation, degeneration, and regeneration, which underpin disease development. Considering an appropriately scaled version of this model, we formally derive, as the corresponding mean-field limit, a system of Fokker-Planck equations, from which we subsequently derive, as a macroscopic model counterpart, a system of differential equations for the mean densities of muscle and immune cells in the cohort of patients and the related variances. Then, we study long-time asymptotics for the mean-field model by determining the quasi-equilibrium cell distribution functions, which are in the form of probability density functions of inverse Gamma distributions, and proving the long-time convergence to such quasi-equilibrium distributions. The analytical results obtained are illustrated by means of a sample of results of numerical simulations. The modeling approach presented here has the potential to offer new insights into the balance between degeneration and regeneration mechanisms in the progression of muscular dystrophies, and provides a basis for future extensions, including the modeling of therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior and real-time scattering dynamics of the interacting $\phi^4$ quantum field theory in $(1+1)$ dimensions using uniform matrix product states and the time-dependent variational principle. A finite-entanglement scaling analysis at $\lambda = 0.8$ bounds the critical mass-squared to $\mu_c^2 \in [-0.3190,-0.3185]$ and provides a quantitative map of the symmetric, near-critical, weakly broken, and deeply broken regimes. Using these ground states as asymptotic vacua, we simulate two-particle collisions in a sandwich geometry and extract the elastic scattering probability $P_{11\to 11}(E)$ and Wigner time delay $\Delta t(E)$ following the prescription of Jha et al. [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 023266 (2025)]. We find strongly inelastic scattering in the symmetric phase ($P_{11\to 11} \simeq 0.63$, $\Delta t \simeq -180$ for $\mu^2 = 0.2$), almost perfectly elastic collisions in the spontaneously broken phase ($P_{11\to 11} \simeq 0.998$, $\Delta t \simeq -270$ for $\mu^2=-0.2$ and $P_{11\to 11} \simeq 1$, $\Delta t \simeq -177.781$ for $\mu^2=-0.5$), and a breakdown of the sandwich evolution precisely at the critical coupling, which provides a dynamical signature of the quantum critical point. These results demonstrate that TDVP-based uniform matrix product states can probe nonperturbative scattering and critical dynamics in lattice $\phi^4$ theory with controlled entanglement truncation.

We prove that eigenstates can be parametrized in a classification surface, which is a hypersurface of a 4-dimension space. This classification surface is a powerful device giving topological properties of the energy band structure; the analysis of its fundamental group proves that all singularities of the band structure can be characterized by four independent winding (integer) numbers. Lieb case separates: its classification surface differs and there is only one winding number.

Abstract: Describing and understanding the consequences of competing interactions remains profoundly challenging in both classical and quantum systems, as it is difficult to identify suitable order parameters, thereby hindering the characterization of certain phases such as the floating phase found in the one-dimensional axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model in the presence of the frustration interactions between the nearest and next-nearest neighbor sites. In this work, we employ the pattern picture to explore the frustration physics in such a model. This picture has been comprehensively detailed in our previous article [Yang and Luo, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{112}, 044102 (2025)]. Here, we apply it to the ANNNI model with periodic boundary conditions, considering system sizes ranging from $L=16$ to $L=128$. Our results demonstrate that the ground state of the system comprises four phases: ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, floating, and $\langle 2,2 \rangle$ antiphase. The transition from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic phase is continuous, analogous to that in the transverse-field Ising model, while the transition from the floating phase to the antiphase is first order. Furthermore, the floating phase exhibits particularly intriguing characteristics: states with distinct domain structures emerge successively as the frustration parameter increases. As the system size grows, this succession becomes progressively denser, leading to the reasonable inference that it eventually approaches a continuous variation in the thermodynamic limit. To validate the effectiveness of our picture, we computed the second derivative of the ground-state energy, which exhibits multiple dips within the floating phase$-$consistent with the pattern language.

Abstract: State transfer between different quantum systems is key for successful quantum technologies. Over long distances, photons are irreplaceable, but on short ranges in miniaturized complex devices or hybrid systems, coupling via orders of magnitude shorter-wavelength acoustic waves has great potential. With interfaces to light, acoustic waves, and more, optically active quantum dots (QDs) are essential for multi-component systems. Here, we propose a hybrid acousto-optical method for non-resonant QD charge state control, extending the recent all-optical swing-up state preparation. We show that exciton and biexciton states, or other superpositions of charge states, can be prepared. Each field can act as a trigger, allowing for the implementation of either an optically gated acoustic control or the opposite scheme, where an optical pulse controls the transition during acoustic modulation. Thus, we introduce acoustic state control into a system that lacks direct acoustic coupling between the states. The method does not rely on pulse shaping and is expected to work with arbitrary pulse shapes as long as the optical dressing is performed quasi-adiabatically. Evaluating the phonon impact, we find an almost decoherence-free exciton preparation even at elevated temperatures with current QD and acoustic technology. This approach may also pave the way for optically controlled entanglement between emitters and acoustic modes, and further on-chip state transfer via quantum acoustic buses.

Abstract: We introduce a numerical strategy to efficiently solve the out-of-equilibrium Dyson equation in the transient regime. By discretizing the equation into a compact matrix form and applying state-of-the-art matrix compression techniques, we achieve significant improvements in computational efficiency, which result in quasi-linear scaling of both time and space complexity with propagation time. This enables to compute accurate solutions even for systems with multiple and disparate time scales. We benchmark our solver by simulating a voltage-biased Josephson junction formed by a quantum dot connected to two superconducting leads.

Abstract: We present a general framework for determining the power-efficiency trade-off relations across arbitrary thermal machines, addressing the lack of unified optimization results stemming from their diverse functionalities (e.g., heat engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps). For time-dependent cycle irreversibility $A(\tau)$ following a $\tau^{-\alpha}$ power law, where $\alpha$ is an interaction-dependent parameter, we show that engineering the interactions between thermal machines and reservoirs enables control over the trade-off relations, with the efficiency at maximum power approaching Carnot efficiency as $\alpha$ increases. Setting $\alpha=1$ naturally recovers typical low-dissipation regime results. Additionally, we derive the first power-efficiency trade-off for finite-time quantum adiabatic Otto machines with $\tau^{-2}$-scaling. This work establishes a unified constraint for thermodynamic cycles across non-equilibrium regimes, facilitating consistent optimization of diverse thermal devices in practice.

Abstract: There are many exotic thermodynamic processes that are hard to study in nature. Here, we synthesize a structured environment to explore the extremes of thermodynamics. We present an engine running at extreme temperatures of above ten Mega-Kelvin. Our underdamped engine is realised by electrically levitating and controlling a charged microparticle in vacuum. Giant fluctuations are observed in the engine's heat exchange with the environment, while its efficiency shows stochastic events where more work is performed by the engine than heat consumed. Moreover, the non-uniformity of the synthetic environment leads to the particle experiencing position dependent diffusion, a critical phenomenon in microscale biological processes. We theoretically account for the effects of multiplicative noise and find excellent agreement with the observed behavior.

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is an important tool for effective quantum computing in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the traditional hardware-efficient ansatz without taking into account symmetries requires more computational resources to explore the unnecessary regions in the Hilbert space. The conventional Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) algorithm, which can calculate excited states, is also unable to effectively handle degenerate states since the loss function only contains the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In this study, the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with two lattice sites and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with four lattice sites are calculated. By incorporating symmetries into the quantum circuits and loss function, we find that both the ground state and excited state calculations are improved greatly compared to the case without symmetries. The enhancement in excited state calculations is particularly significant. This is because quantum circuits that conserve the particle number are used, and appropriate penalty terms are added to the loss function, enabling the optimization process to correctly identify degenerate states. The results are verified through repeated simulations.

Abstract: Self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions generally do not form a polar order. However, in this Letter, we show that when multiple types of such particles coexist and interact through aligning interactions between different species, a global polar order can emerge through the formation of elongated clusters with alternating domains of each species. By developing a mean-field theory, we reveal the conditions for cluster formation and characterize the resulting patterns. Our findings highlight the critical role of inter-species interactions in the emergence of complex ordered states.

Abstract: We improve the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation. As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension. This work establishes the Lanczos method as a reliable and accurate framework for finding multiple low-lying states within a tensor-network representation

Abstract: Quaternary mixed-metal M(II)2M(III)Ch2X3 chalcohalides are an emerging material class for photovoltaic absorbers that combines the beneficial optoelectronic properties of lead-based halide perovskites with the stability of metal chalcogenides. Inspired by the recent discovery of lead-free mixed-metal chalcohalides materials, we utilized a combination of density functional theory and machine learning to determine compositional trends and chemical design rules in the lead-free and lead-based materials spaces. We explored a total of 54 M(II)2M(III)Ch2X3 materials with M(II) = Sn, Pb, M(III) = In, Sb, Bi, Ch = S, Se, Te, and X = Cl, Br, I per phase (Cmcm, Cmc21 , and P21/c). The P21/c phase is the equilibrium phase at low temperatures, followed by Cmc21 and Cmcm. The fundamental band gaps in Cmcm and Cmc21 are smaller than those in P21/c, but direct band gaps are more common in Cmcm and Cmc21. The effective electron masses in P21/c are significantly larger compared to Cmcm and Cmc21, while the effective hole masses are nearly the same across all three phases. Using random forest regression, we found that the two electron acceptor sites (Ch and X) are crucial in shaping the properties of mixed-metal chalcohalide compounds. Furthermore, the electron donor sites (M(II) and M(III)) can be used to finetune the material properties to desired applications. These design rules enable precise tailoring of mixed-metal chalcohalide compounds for a variety of applications.

Abstract: We study the stochastic dynamics of a Brownian particle after it is suddenly released from a harmonic trap moving with constant velocity through a fluctuating correlated medium, described by a scalar Gaussian field with relaxational dynamics and in contact with a thermal bath. We show that, after the release, the particle exhibits recoil, i.e., it moves in the direction opposite to the drag. As expected, this effect vanishes if the field equilibrates instantaneously. The final value of the average position of the particle is reached algebraically in time in the case of conserved dynamics of the field or for non-conserved dynamics at the critical point. Our predictions are expected to be relevant, at least qualitatively, to driven colloidal particles in liquid media close to critical points.

Abstract: We demonstrate wide-field optical microscopy of the pressure distribution at approximately 20 GPa in a diamond anvil cell (DAC), using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) as quantum sensors. Pressure and non-hydrostaticity maps are obtained by fitting optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra with models incorporating hydrostatic and uniaxial stress conditions. Two methods for introducing NDs with a pressure-transmitting medium are compared, revealing that the embedding approach affects the degree of non-hydrostaticity. This ND-based technique offers a powerful imaging platform for probing pressure-induced phenomena and is extendable to other physical quantities such as magnetic fields.

Abstract: The development of $p$-type oxide semiconductors remains impeded
  by the inherently low-lying valence-band maximum (VBM) dominated by O-2$p$ states.
  A prevailing approach to mitigate this limitation is
  to elevate the VBM by introducing cation states that hybridize with O-2$p$ orbitals
  or lie energetically above the O-2$p$ level.
  Nevertheless, the $p$-type oxides reported to date exhibit limited hole mobilities.
  To expand the search space, it is essential to accurately understand the intrinsic difficulty
  of introducing holes into O-2$p$-dominated bands.
  Accordingly, we evaluated 845 oxides to identify those
  in which holes can be doped into O-2$p$-dominated bands.
  Our high-throughput screening revealed CaCdO$_2$ as the only promising exemplar,
  in which the VBM is slightly hybridized with deep-lying Cd-3$d$ states.
  Our screening suggests that hole doping into O-2$p$-dominated bands is extremely difficult
  and thus reinforces the effectiveness of the traditional ``VBM-raising strategy.''

Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs). Using a semi-classical approach based on linear stability analysis of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations, we derive a damped Mathieu equation governing parametric instabilities. Our analysis reveals well-separated regions of parametric resonance and Jeans instability in parameter space, with distinct growth rate characteristics: Jeans instability decreases monotonically to zero at the critical wavenumber $k_J$, while parametric resonance exhibits non-monotonic behavior with a clear maximum. These findings provide explicit experimental guidelines for accessing the parametric resonance regime. Numerical simulations demonstrate the transition from Faraday wave formation to Jeans collapse as gravitational strength increases, validating our theoretical framework.

Abstract: Flexoelectricity - polarization induced by strain gradients - offers a route to polar functionality in centrosymmetric dielectrics, where traditional piezoelectric effects are absent. This study investigates the flexoelectric effect in epitaxial $\mathrm{BaHfO_3}$ (BHO) thin films, a centrosymmetric and paraelectric perovskite. While a large lattice mismatch induces defect-driven relaxation, a coherently grown BHO film undergoes elastic relaxation, forming intrinsic strain gradients exceeding $10^5\ \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. A 29-fold enhancement in spontaneous polarization is observed at an electric field of $4\ \mathrm{MV\,cm}^{-1}$ for BHO exhibiting a strain gradient compared to relaxed BHO. This enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric coupling, which is isolated from ferroelectric and piezoelectric contributions due to the centrosymmetric nature and the absence of phase transitions in BHO. The findings establish a clear link between engineered strain gradients and enhanced polarizability in oxide thin films, offering a benchmark system for deconvoluting the flexoelectric effect from other polar effects. These results provide a basis for exploiting flexoelectricity in dielectric devices and advance the fundamental understanding of strain-coupled phenomena in functional oxides.

Abstract: We study analytically and numerically a Hopfield fully-connected network with $d$-dimensional vector spins. These networks are models of associative memory that generalize the standard Hopfield with Ising spins, where $P$ examples are stored in a network of $N$ units as local minima in an energy landscape. We study the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties of the system, considering the system in its retrieval phase $\alpha<\alpha_c$ and beyond, where $\alpha=P/N$ is the capacity of the system and $\alpha_c$ is its critical value, above which storage fails. We derive the Replica Symmetric solution for the equilibrium thermodynamics of the system, together with its phase diagram: we find that the retrieval phase of the network shrinks with growing spin dimension, having ultimately a vanishing critical capacity $\alpha_c\propto 1/d$ in the large $d$ limit. As a trade-off, we observe that in the same limit vector Hopfield networks are able to denoise corrupted input patterns in the first step of retrieval dynamics, up to very large capacities $\alpha\propto d$. We also study the static properties of the system at zero temperature, considering the statistical properties of soft modes of the energy Hessian spectrum. We find that local minima of the energy landscape related to memory states have ungapped spectra with rare soft eigenmodes: these excitations are localized, their measure condensating on the noisiest neurons of the memory state.

Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in various branches of physics. The literature does not readily provide, however, practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.

Abstract: Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.

Abstract: The Hamiltonian of the $N$-state clock model is written in terms of a coupled Temperley-Lieb (TL) algebra defined by $N-1$ types of TL generators. This generalizes a previous result for $N=3$ obtained by J. F. Fjelstad and T. M\r{a}nsson [J. Phys. A {\bf 45} (2012) 155208]. The $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric clock chain Hamiltonian expressed in terms of the coupled TL algebra generalizes the well known correspondence between the $N$-state Potts model and the TL algebra. The algebra admits a pictorial description in terms of a planar algebra involving parafermionic operators attached to $n$ strands. A key ingredient in the resolution of diagrams is the string Fourier transform. The pictorial presentation also allows a description of the Hilbert space. We also give a pictorial description of the representation related to the staggered XX spin chain. Just as the pictorial representation of the TL algebra has proven to be particularly useful in providing a visual and intuitive way to understand and manipulate algebraic expressions, it is anticipated that the pictorial representation of the coupled TL algebra may lead to further progress in understanding various aspects of the $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ clock model, including the superintegrable chiral Potts model.

Abstract: We investigate topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional electron system with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling driven by circularly polarized light. Within the Floquet framework, we demonstrate that light-matter interaction induces nontrivial band topology characterized by a quantized anomalous Hall response, with Chern insulating phases of C = 0, 1, and 3. These transitions are governed by gap closings at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, controlled by the intensity and energy of the incident light. Introducing a weak linear Rashba term displaces Dirac points in momentum space without modifying the topology, whereas a purely linear Rashba system remains topologically trivial (C = 0). When both linear and cubic Rashba couplings are finite, the linear term confines nonzero-Chern phases to narrow parameter windows. In contrast, incorporating a linear Dresselhaus term into the cubic Rashba system can trigger topological transitions even at small coupling strengths. These results clarify the interplay between distinct spin-orbit interactions in Floquet-engineered Chern insulators and offer experimentally relevant pathways for achieving light-controlled topological phases.

Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable large-scale atomistic simulations at moderate computational cost while retaining ab initio accuracy. MLIPs trained on coupled-cluster data, particularly CCSD(T), have emerged a promising route to achieve chemical accuracy beyond the limits of density functional theory (DFT) and to incorporate non-empirical van der Waals (vdW) interactions. Most existing approaches are, however, still not straightforwardly applicable for systems with extended covalent networks such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) due to the limited availability of CCSD(T) for periodic systems. Here we present a methodology to train MLIPs with CCSD(T) accuracy for these systems. The approach uses the {\Delta}-learning method with a dispersion-corrected tight-binding baseline. This strategy enables training on compact molecular fragments while preserving transferability toward the periodic systems. Dispersion interactions are accounted for by adding vdW-bound multimers in the training set, and the combination with a vdW-aware tight-binding baseline allows the formally local MLIP to attain CCSD(T)-level accuracy even for systems dominated by long-range vdW forces. The resulting potential yields root-mean-square energy errors below 0.4 meV/atom on training and test sets and reproduces electronic total atomization energies, bond lengths, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and inter-molecular interaction energies for benchmark molecular systems. We apply the method to a prototypical quasi-two-dimensional COF composed of carbon and hydrogen. The COF structure, inter-layer binding energies, and hydrogen absorption are analyzed at CCSD(T) accuracy. The developed methodology opens a practical route to large-scale atomistic simulations for systems with extended covalent networks and vdW interactions with chemical accuracy.

In this paper we study magnetoconductivity in large Fermi energy Dirac semimetals, in one of which (ZrTe$_5$) the effect was observed for the first time. Starting with a Hamiltonian for a semi-realistic model of such a Dirac semimetal, we apply the Non-equilibrium Diagram Technique (NDT, or the Keldysh technique) to derive the kinetic equations, to investigate the electrons relaxation due to interaction with phonons and disorder, and, finally, to calculate the DC magnetoconductivity (the longitudinal to magnetic field component of conductivity) as a function of magnetic field strength and temperature. Finally, we compare the obtained temperature dependencies with available to us experimental data.

Abstract: We apply a first-principles-based atomistic model to investigate the BaTi(1-x)Zr(x)O3 phase diagram, focusing on both macroscopic and local structural changes. Our approach, which combines molecular dynamics with machine learning techniques, accurately captures the influence of Ti and Zr cations on their local environment and its evolution with composition and temperature. The computed phase diagram shows excellent agreement with existing experimental and theoretical data. Beyond reproducing known results, our analysis reveals that the behavior of the solid solution across different compositions and temperatures can be understood in terms of coexisting Ti cells with different symmetries, whose stability depends on the local B-site configuration. This local-phase-based approach provides a unified description of the distinct regions of the solid solution, including ferroelectric, relaxor, and dipolar glass phases, and captures the continuous evolution from one regime to another. Our findings demonstrate how atomic-level distortions drive the complex macroscopic behavior of the material.

A systematic variation of tracer, intrinsic and interdiffusion coefficients with composition could be estimated in the ternary solid solution. Following, the possibility of producing Al Ti constant PB diffusion profiles keeping constant Ni, Co, Fe in the quinary system is demonstrated. The estimation of diffusion coefficients of all the elements at the Kirkendall marker plane of a single diffusion couple profile is elaborated. PINN optimisation parameters are established using self and impurity diffusion coefficients in Ni and tracer diffusion coefficients at the Kirkendall marker plane. The reliability of optimized parameters is validated by comparing with the interdiffusion coefficients estimated from binary NiTi, NiAl and PB diffusion profiles, indicating extendibility to even lower order systems.

Abstract: Boron-doped diamond crystals (BDD, C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$) exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, electronic tunability, and resistance to radiation damage. This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and (100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies; however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design. The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals. These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies.

Abstract: Molecular spins offer a promising platform for quantum sensing, particularly in organic, supramolecular or biological environments.. Recognition of the signals by these systems is of particular interest, given their possible integration into more complex structures and their possible use as sensors in close proximity to analytes. In this work, we develop two quantum sensing protocols that enable discrimination between different time-dependent magnetic field, without requiring its periodicity or specific matching conditions with the microwave manipulating sequence. These are based on the Hahn echo sequence and have been tested on VO(TPP) and VOPt(SOCPh$)_{4}$ molecular spins embedded in a superconducting YBCO microwave resonator. We report a magnetic field sensitivity up to a few $10^{-7}$ T Hz$^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ (with lower bounds approaching $10^{-8}$ T Hz$^{-\frac{1}{2}}$) for signals with duration of a few microseconds. Under the given conditions, the minimum signal area that can be measured is in the $10^{-10}$ T s range, suggesting a potential trade-off between minimum measurable field and the required signal duration and memory time.

Abstract: We study Josephson couplings in unconventional superconductors and generalize the Sigrist-Rice formula by incorporating symmetry constraints and interface orientation disorder. Applying this framework to granular superconducting rings, we establish a no-go result that single-band chiral superconductors cannot spontaneously trap a magnetic flux. This rules out chiral $p$-wave pairing in $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd, in light of the half-quantum flux observed in recent Little-Parks experiments. Incorporating the full crystalline and time-reversal symmetries, we show that a fully gapped helical equal-spin pairing state, naturally stabilized by spin-orbit coupling arising from local inversion-symmetry breaking, is instead favored. We further find that granular rings of such superconductors can trap a spontaneous $\pi$ flux in a manner robust against interface disorder.

Abstract: Conventional thermal conductivity modulation approaches typically rely on nano-structural modifications and can only achieve irreversible alternation. Despite being a pioneering quantum strategy for dynamical and reversible thermal conductivity modulation, targeted phonon excitation has been confined to two-dimensional systems, and its effectiveness in three-dimensional systems remains unknown. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of targeted phonon excitation for modulating the thermal conductivity in three-dimensional system by taking bulk boron arsenide (BAs) as a representative material. By combining first-principles calculations with the Boltzmann transport equation, an enhancement up to 2% and a suppression up to 35% relative to the intrinsic thermal conductivity were achieved through targeted phonon excitation. Notably, the modulation effect also exhibited an obvious dependence on excitation intensity, and an opposite modulation effect was observed for specific phonon frequency range. Computational analysis reveals that the non-monotonic modulation tendency under different excitation intensities stems from the competition between the increase in phonon population and the enhancement of phonon scattering, particularly through the reconfiguration of splitting (emission) processes in three-phonon scattering. This work extends the applicability of targeted phonon excitation to 3D systems, provides insights into phonon engineering mechanisms, and lays the foundation for dynamic thermal management and phonon devices.

Abstract: Properties of quantum dot based spin qubits have significant inter-device variability due to unavoidable presence of various types of disorder in semiconductor nanostructures. A significant source of this variability is charge disorder at the semiconductor-oxide interface, which causes unpredictable, yet, as we show here, correlated fluctuations in such essential properties of quantum dots like their mutual tunnel couplings, and electronic confinement energies. This study presents a systematic approach to characterize and mitigate the effects of such disorder. We utilize finite element modeling of a Si/SiGe double quantum dot to generate a large statistical ensemble of devices, simulating the impact of trapped interface charges. This work results in a predictive statistical model capable of generating realistic artificial data for training machine learning algorithms. By applying Principal Component Analysis to this dataset, we identify the dominant modes through which disorder affects the multi-dimensional parameter space of the device. Our findings show that the parameter variations are not arbitrary, but are concentrated along a few principal axes, i.e. there are significant correlations between many properties of the devices.
  We finally compare that against control modes generated by sweeping the gate voltages, revealing limitations of the plunger-only control. This work provides a framework for enhancing the controllability and operational yield of spin qubit devices, by systematically addressing the nature of electrostatic disorder that leads to statistical correlations in properties of double quantum dots.

Abstract: Short-time dynamics in the $2D$ Blume-Capel model, with a non-conserved order-parameter and short-ranged interactions, is analysed. For non-equilibrium dynamics, both at a critical point in the $2D$ Ising universality class and at the tricritical point, we reproduce the values $\Theta=0.190({5})$ and $\Theta=-0.542({5})$, respectively, of the critical initial slip exponent. These agree with more early estimates and with the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation. In phase-ordering kinetics, after a quench into the ordered phase, we establish the validity of short-time dynamics. In the $2D$ Ising universality class, we find $\Theta=0.39({1})$ in agreement with the scaling relation $\lambda=d-2\Theta$.

Abstract: Frequency combs represent a hallmark of coherence emerging from nonlinear dynamics, where periodic driving organizes energy into a precisely spaced spectral structure. Extending this concept to collective excitations in solids such as magnons, the quanta of spin waves in magnetically ordered materials, offers a powerful route to control energy flow, coherence, and information processing in condensed matter systems. Here, we demonstrate deterministic control of Floquet-engineered magnon frequency combs in magnetic vortices using nanosecond voltage pulses. By tuning the pulse duration and timing, we control the nonlinear energy transfer between magnons and the vortex core, enabling the Floquet-engineered initiation or suppression of magnon frequency combs far below their spontaneous instability threshold. This pulse-programmable interaction allows the vortex to sustain magnon-driven auto-oscillation with high phase stability, or to revert to its static ground state on demand. Our results establish vortex-based magnetic systems as a robust solid-state platform for Floquet engineering, bridging nonlinear spin dynamics with frequency conversion and coherent spin-based quantum devices.

We derive the R-matrix and mutually commuting transfer matrices that generate the Hamiltonians of these models, and obtain their exact eigenspectra and eigenstates. Remarkably, the R-matrix is that of the critical transverse-field Ising chain. This work reveals an unexpected connection between the SYK model, central to many-body quantum chaos, and the critical Ising chain, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics.

Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) reduces data transfer latency by rolling memory and logic elements into one compute location. As an emergent material candidate for such an architecture, we propose a strained Weyl semimetal based spin-orbit-torque random-access memory (SWSM-SOTRAM) device. The spin-orbit torque (SOT) originates from two mechanisms: (1) the inverse spin Galvanic effect (iSGE), which generates nonequilibrium in-plane spin accumulation at interfaces, and (2) a bulk spin Hall effect (SHE), which produces a transverse spin current carrying out-of-plane spin angular momentum. The latter is tunable via an exchange Zeeman field. Both effects are evaluated using the tight-binding model coupled with a nonequilibrium Green's function (TB-NEGF) formalism for quantum transport. Information write is achieved through SOT switching of an out-of-plane free magnet. A piezo attached to a magnetostrictive selector modulates the strain in the latter, leading to the rotation of the magnetization and hence the exchange Zeeman field exerted on the Weyl semimetal. This strain-controlled exchange field enables the symmetry tuning of the Weyl semimetal and modulation of its spin Hall effect. The TB-NEGF calculations of SHE and iSGE, combined with Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations of magnetization dynamics, establish the SOT switching mechanism and demonstrate a pathway toward the SWSM-SOTRAM PIM device.

Abstract: We study the $T=0$ phase diagrams of models of bilayers of $S=1/2$ square lattices antiferromagnets with SU(2) Heisenberg symmetry that have 2, 4, and 6 spin exchanges. We study two families of bilayer models with distinct internal symmetries and, hence, different phase diagram topologies. A traditional bilayer model in which the interlayer interaction is Heisenberg so that the two layers can exchange spin (and energy) with each other, making it possible to achieve a simple dimerized valence bond liquid-like state. The resulting phase diagram is rich with N\'eel, valence bond solid and simple dimer phases, and both first-order and continuous transitions, which we demonstrate are consistent with the conventional Landau theory of order parameters. In the second family of models in which the layers can exchange only energy but no spin (reminiscent of the Ashkin-Teller coupling), the simple dimer state cannot occur. The phase diagrams reveal a number of phase transitions that are accessed for the first time. We find that the phase transition between N\'eel and VBS is first order in both the spin-spin and energy-energy coupled models, although they have strikingly distinct finite-size scaling behavior and that the transition from VBS to dimer in the spin-spin coupling model deviates from the expected scenario of an XY model with dangerously irrelevant four-fold anisotropy.

Abstract: Classical phase-field theories of brittle fracture capture toughness-controlled crack growth but do not account for the material's strength surface, which governs fracture nucleation in the absence of cracks. The phase-field formulation of Kumar et al. (2020) proposed a blueprint for incorporating the strength surface while preserving toughness-controlled propagation by introducing a nucleation driving force and presented results for the Drucker-Prager surface. Following this blueprint, Chockalingam (2025) recently derived a general driving-force expression that incorporates arbitrary strength surfaces. The present work implements this driving force within a finite-element framework and incorporates representative strength surfaces that span diverse mathematical and physical characteristics-the Mohr-Coulomb, 3D Hoek-Brown, and Mogi-Coulomb surfaces. Through simulations of canonical fracture problems, the formulation is comprehensively validated across fracture regimes, capturing (i) nucleation under uniform stress, (ii) crack growth from large pre-existing flaws, and (iii) fracture governed jointly by strength and toughness. While the strength surfaces examined here already encompass a broad range of brittle materials, the results demonstrate the generality and robustness of the proposed driving-force construction for materials governed by arbitrary strength surfaces.

Abstract: This work quantifies the effect of misfit and threading dislocations on the surface (interfacial) energies of PbTe-PbSe interfaces, with the defect structures of the interfaces being obtained from atomistic and multiscale simulations of their manufacturing processes. Simulation results show that direct bonding produces semi-coherent interfaces with two-dimensional misfit dislocation networks, while heteroepitaxial processes produce complex three-dimensional dislocation structures with both misfit and threading dislocations. Surface energies at these interfaces were determined by computing the interaction energies across these interfaces. Compared with coherent interfaces, directly bonded interfaces exhibit up to ~23% lower surface energy, while the surface energies of epitaxially grown interfaces can be nearly 50% lower. The results demonstrate the significant effects of dislocations, which are unavoidable during the manufacturing processes of lattice mismatched heterostructures, on surface (interfacial) energy.

Abstract: Nonlinear processes can offer pathways to next-generation sensors and frequency mixing devices to overcome modern imaging, detection, and communication challenges. In this article, we report on strong second and third-order nonlinear optical responses in visible and terahertz (THz) light in single crystals of the noble metal dichalcogenide PdTe2. We find that buried conduction and valence topological surface states of PdTe2 lead to resonant enhancement of optical second-harmonic generation. On the other hand, although the nonlinear responses obtained with THz excitation are not close to this resonance, they can be clearly observed in reflection geometry, even in the presence of broadband excitation, where optical filters are not necessary to observe the odd-order higher harmonic gain. By carefully considering the radiative photocurrent framework of stimulated THz emission, we are able to extract fingerprints of both second- and third-order processes in the THz regime, and show that PdTe2 is a promising material candidate for radio frequency rectification, frequency mixing, and beam focusing.

Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions-- where forces between entities are asymmetric-- govern a wide range of nonequilibrium phenomena, yet their role in structural transitions in living and active systems remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a transition between nonreciprocal states using starfish embryos at different stages of development, where interactions are inherently asymmetric and tunable. Experiments, interaction inference, and topological analysis yield a nonreciprocal state diagram spanning crystalline, flocking, and fragmented states, revealing that weak nonreciprocity promotes structural order while stronger asymmetry disrupts it. To capture these transitions, we introduce topological landscapes, mapping the distribution of structural motifs across state space. We further develop topological flowscapes, a dynamic framework that quantifies transitions between collective states and detects an informational rate shift from the experimental state transition. Together, these results establish a general approach for decoding nonequilibrium transitions and uncover how asymmetric interactions sculpt the dynamical and structural architecture of active and living matter.

Abstract: This work introduces a new theoretical model for active matter ("complementary-spins" or c-spins), exploring the interplay of positional and orientational order in mobile agents with rotational freedom, divided into two populations with contrasting interactions. The system's behavior depends on its size and a control parameter (circular anisotropy) that splits the agents' natural rotational frequencies. Key findings include distinct phases based on anisotropy: Small Anisotropy: Stable, regular equilibrium patterns emerge. Moderate Anisotropy: Formation of complex, non-equilibrium topological point defects (vortex states), which are bistable with uniform patterns. These robust, self-repairing defects exhibit counter-rotating c-spin loop trains, spin-momentum locking, and dissipationless flow, classified by a two-valued topological charge. High Anisotropy: Transition to active turbulence and loss of order. Statistical analysis reveals a double phase transition at a critical value: a standard symmetry-breaking transition and a novel topological phase transition activating the vortex complexes. Increasing system size enhances organizational complexity and the development of spin-momentum locked transport networks. This model provides a new framework for understanding robustness and morphogenesis in living systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a uniform and standardized approach for analytically verifying the stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelastic material models. Here, we address stability as fulfillment of the Hill's condition - i.e. the positive definiteness of the material modulus in the Kirchhoff stress - log-strain relation. For incompressible material behavior, all mathematically and mechanically possible deformations lie within a range bounded, on the one hand, by uniaxial states and, on the other hand, by biaxial states; shear {deformation} states lie in between. This becomes particularly clear when the possible states are represented in the invariant plane. This very representation is now also used to visualize the regions of unstable material behavior depending on the selected strain energy function and the respective data set of material parameters. This demonstrates how, for some constellations of energy functions, with appropriate selection or calibration of parameters, stable and unstable regions can be observed. If such cases occur, it is no longer legitimate to use them to initiate, for example, finite element simulations. This is particularly striking when, for example, a fit appears stable in uniaxial tension, but the same parameter set for shear states results in unstable behavior without this being specifically investigated. The presented approach can reveal simple indicators for this.

Abstract: Collagen fibrils are the building block of many biological tissues, which viability depend on the fibrils properties. Altered properties of collagen fibrils are central to the appearance of many diseases, and physiological or native properties must be reproduced for tissue engineering. Yet, the self-assembly, the structure, and therefore the properties of collagen fibrils remain elusive. One main reason is the extreme sensitivity of the fibrils to their environmental conditions, and in particular hydration which is only loosely bound by experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanics are an integral part of the self-assembly process and may result in internal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions. Here, we propose to investigate internal stresses in collagen fibrils by means of molecular dynamics simulations of the collagen microfibril model. Our simulations reveal the quantitative evolution of internal stresses in collagen fibrils with hydration. We establish a value of native hydration of collagen fibrils at 0.78 g/g based on an absence of cross-sectional stresses. In turn, we determine a quantitative estimate of internal longitudinal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions of 210 MPa. We find that internal longitudinal stresses are caused by an over-extended protein backbone rather than partial hydration, which appears remnant of the local forces driving collagen self-assembly. We also demonstrate the consequences of internal longitudinal stresses on the mechanical properties of collagen fibrils, which the absence of induces more than a 20% decrease in the Young's modulus. Overall, our findings provide insights into the native structure and properties of collagen fibrils. More than ever, collagen fibrils appear to be assembled via an out-of-equilibrium process key for the synthesis of viable tissues.

Abstract: We perform cell segmentation on images from experimental studies of confluent, mobile cells in epithelial monolayers and show that these systems possess a broad, positively-skewed shape parameter distribution $P(\mathcal{A})$, where $\mathcal{A}=p^2/4\pi a$, $p$ is the perimeter, and $a$ is area of each cell. $P(\mathcal{A})$ is peaked at a value higher than the typical shape parameter $\mathcal{A}^* \sim 1.15$ that occurs for randomly packed, static confluent cell monolayers. The distribution does not arise from a heterogeneous population of cells with different fixed $\mathcal{A}$, nor can it arise from cell shape fluctuations from strains below the elastic limit. Instead, we find that all cells in each monolayer sample $\mathcal{A}$ values that span the full shape parameter distribution. We develop a deformable particle model that allows cell perimeter to adapt to local forces during cell motion, and this model recovers $P(\mathcal{A})$ to within $5\%$ for both MDCK and HaCaT epithelial cell monolayers. These results emphasize that confluent epithelial monolayers of mobile cells generate a well-defined broad shape parameter distribution that is independent of the initial cell shapes.

Abstract: Using the fact that flat space with a boundary is related by a Weyl transformation to anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, one may study observables in boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) by placing a CFT in AdS. In addition to correlation functions of local operators, a quantity of interest is the free energy of the CFT computed on the AdS space with hyperbolic ball metric, i.e. with a spherical boundary. It is natural to expect that the AdS free energy can be used to define a quantity that decreases under boundary renormalization group (RG) flows. We test this idea by discussing in detail the case of the large $N$ critical $O(N)$ model in general dimension $d$, as well as its perturbative descriptions in the epsilon-expansion. Using the AdS approach, we recover the various known boundary critical behaviors of the model, and we compute the free energy for each boundary fixed point, finding results which are consistent with the conjectured $F$-theorem in a continuous range of dimensions. Finally, we also use the AdS setup to compute correlation functions and extract some of the BCFT data. In particular, we show that using the bulk equations of motion, in conjunction with crossing symmetry, gives an efficient way to constrain bulk two-point functions and extract anomalous dimensions of boundary operators.

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is a property of Hamiltonian equilibrium states which, in the thermodynamic limit, retain a finite average value of an order parameter even after a field coupled to it is adiabatically turned off. In the case of quantum spin models with continuous symmetry, we show that this adiabatic process is also accompanied by the suppression of the fluctuations of the symmetry generator -- namely, the collective spin component along an axis of symmetry. In systems of $S=1/2$ spins or qubits, the combination of the suppression of fluctuations along one direction and of the persistence of transverse magnetization leads to spin squeezing -- a much sought-after property of quantum states, both for the purpose of entanglement detection as well as for metrological uses. Focusing on the case of XXZ models spontaneously breaking a U(1) (or even SU(2)) symmetry, we show that the adiabatically prepared states have nearly minimal spin uncertainty; that the minimum phase uncertainty that one can achieve with these states scales as $N^{-3/4}$ with the number of spins $N$; and that this scaling is attained after an adiabatic preparation time scaling linearly with $N$. Our findings open the door to the adiabatic preparation of strongly spin-squeezed states in a large variety of quantum many-body devices including e.g. optical lattice clocks.

Abstract: Global social and ecological challenges represent collective action problems requiring rapid and sufficient cooperation with pro-mitigation norms. Sociopolitical polarization hinders such cooperation. Prior agent-based models showed polarization emerges naturally in structured social networks and polarized cluster dissolution rate limits consensus formation rate. Here we study how guided link rewiring affects depolarization dynamics across synthetic and empirical (Facebook, Twitter) network topologies. We compare heuristic rewiring algorithms representing random meetings, mutual acquaintance introductions, and community bridging, alongside topology-based link recommender algorithms (Who to Follow and node2vec). Our heuristic algorithms all outperform Who to Follow in generating cooperative consensus. Homophilic rewiring generates cooperative consensus when agents can easily change opinions. However, heterophilic rewiring achieves this over broader conditions and can accelerate cooperative consensus formation by ~20%, including where up to 33% of the population experiences backfiring interactions. Heterophilic rewiring also vastly outperforms topology-based recommender algorithms. Random rewiring performed consistently well, achieving higher steady-state cooperation than seven out of eight more complex algorithms. Large disparities in steady-state cooperation for topology-based recommender systems highlight their volatility across network structures. Overall, our work reveals a subtle interplay between topology, rewiring algorithm and social depolarization, suggesting strong potential for carefully redesigning social networking technologies for social good.

Abstract: Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model improves itself using its own predictions, has attracted attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD with a linear classifier for binary classification on noisy Gaussian mixture data. For the analysis, we employ the replica method from statistical physics. Our findings reveal that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also identify two practical heuristics to enhance SD: early stopping that limits the number of stages, which is broadly effective, and bias parameter fixing, which helps under label imbalance. To empirically validate our theoretical findings derived from our toy model, we conduct additional experiments on CIFAR-10 classification using pretrained ResNet backbone. These results provide both theoretical and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.

Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy center in 2D hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as a promising quantum sensor. However, its sensitivity is constrained due to ubiquitous nuclear spins in the environment. The nuclear spins, hyperfine coupled with the central electron spin, effectively behave as magnetic field fluctuators, leading to rapid decoherence. Here, we explore the effectiveness of static magnetic field strength and orientation in realizing peculiar subspaces that can lead to enhanced spin coherence. Specifically, using detailed numerical simulations of the spin Hamiltonian, we identify specific field configurations that minimize energy gradients and, consequently, are expected to facilitate decoherence suppression. We also develop an approximate analytical model based on the perturbation theory that accurately predicts these low-gradient subspaces for magnetic fields aligned with the electron spin quantization axis, applicable not only to boron vacancies but to any spin-1 electronic system coupled to nearby nuclear spins. Furthermore, to stimulate experimental validation, we estimate coherence lifetimes as a function of various bias field configurations and demonstrate that significant decoherence suppression can indeed be achieved in certain regions. These findings and the developed methodology offer valuable insights for mitigating decoherence in a low-field regime.

Abstract: Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics cause decoherence in superconducting circuits, yet their origin, frequency distribution, and dipole moments remain poorly understood. Current probes, primarily based on qubits or resonators, require complex fabrication and measure defects only within narrow frequency bands and limited mode volumes, restricting insight into TLS behavior in isolated materials and interfaces. We introduce Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS), a broadband 3D waveguide technique that enables probing of TLS ensembles at cryogenic temperatures. Complementary to the dielectric dipper method, this approach probes a broader spectrum and reveals interference of drive-induced sidebands in TLS ensembles. The broadband, power-tunable nature of BCTDS makes it well suited for studying dressed-state physics in driven TLS ensembles, including multi-photon processes and sideband-resolved dynamics. By analyzing Fourier-transformed time-domain signals, BCTDS reveals eigen-mode frequencies of undriven TLS ensembles through characteristic V-shaped features and uncovers memory effects arising from interactions and broadband excitation. The modular method can be applied throughout device fabrication, informing mitigation strategies and advancing the design of low-loss materials with broad implications for quantum technologies and materials science.

Abstract: Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings, alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion, typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and, more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance. Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging molecular quantum information technologies.

Abstract: Designing stable cluster synchronization patterns is a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics of networks with great relevance to understanding neuronal and brain dynamics. So far, cluster synchronization has been studied exclusively in a node-based dynamical approach, according to which oscillators are associated only with the nodes of the network. Here, we propose a topological synchronization dynamics model based on the use of the Topological Dirac operator, which allows us to design cluster synchronization patterns for topological oscillators associated with both nodes and edges of a network. In particular, by modulating the ground state of the free energy associated with the dynamical model, we construct topological cluster synchronization patterns. These are aligned with the eigenstates of the Topological Dirac Equation that provide a very useful decomposition of the dynamical state of node and edge signals associated with the network. We use linear stability analysis to predict the stability of the topological cluster synchronization patterns and provide numerical evidence of the ability to design several stable topological cluster synchronization states on real connectome data, random graphs, and on stochastic block models.

Abstract: We introduce a nonequilibrium phenomenon, reminiscent of Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC), that arises in the transient dynamics following an interaction quench between a quantum system and a localized defect. Even if the system comprises only a single particle, the overlap between the asymptotic and initial superposition states vanishes according to a power-law scaling with the number of energy eigenstates entering the initial state and an exponent that depends on the interaction strength. The presence of quantum coherence in the initial state is reflected onto the discrete counterpart of an infinite discontinuity in the system spectral function, a hallmark of Anderson's OC, as well as in the quasiprobability distribution of work due to the quench transformation. The positivity loss of the work distribution is directly linked with a reduction of the minimal time imposed by quantum mechanics for the state to orthogonalize. We propose an experimental test of coherence-enhanced orthogonalization dynamics based on Ramsey interferometry of a trapped cold-atom system.

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating open quantum systems coupled to Gaussian environments valid for any configuration and coupling strength. The algorithm is applicable to problems with strongly coupled, or non-Markovian, environments, problems with multiple environments out of mutual equilibrium, and problems with time-dependent Hamiltonians. We show that the algorithm can reproduce the true dynamics of such problems at arbitrary accuracy and, for a broad range of problems, only adds a minor resource cost relative to Trotterized time evolution; the cost is low-degree polynomial in the inverse target accuracy. The algorithm is based on the insight that any Gaussian environment can be represented as a train of ancillary qubits that sequentially interact with the system through a time-local coupling, given by the convolution square root of the bath correlation function; this is a secondary result of our work. Our results open up new applications of quantum computers for efficient simulation of non-equilibrium and open quantum systems.

Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.

Abstract: Plasmonic Optical matter (OM), composed of optically bound metallic particles, can be rotated by transferring the spin angular momentum (SAM) of chiral light to the assembly. Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.

Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.
